## Constraints make decisions easy


In the [last essay](/how-to-be-happy-constraints.html), we talked about how ~~purpose~~ constraints
help us make decisions so easily.

When I had the EA constraint (save as many lives as possible), it was
very easy for me to make decisions on things. Go to the US? A
resounding "Yes it makes more money". A lack of said constraint,
completely leaves me (and I assume others as well) baffled with a huge
solution space.

No amount of pros and cons list seem to help. Pros to go the US, I can
make in 10 years what I can never dream to make in Netherlands. The
cons being I will probably have less time to engage in my passion like
climbing or music etc. (at least for the next 3 years in my prime while I try to
establish myself). 

Even though at this point I have a delibitating condition (not sure
what it is) which probably takes a few months to repair, I am still
thinking ok probably this year I can't make it to my masters, I will
request a deferral. Lol. And then the same conundrum next year.

~~Also, temporary constraints are not good enough. Even though at this
point I have a condition that will stop me from going to the US this
year (#constraint), the conundrum after this year remains. I am still
thinking that I will request a deferral. And then next year I am faced
with the same shit.~~

Question is, is there a constraint that I can apply to reduce the
solution space to get to a resounding YES? Where is that constraint?
What does that constraint look like?

Clearly I am not interested in adding a random constraint like
marrying or having a kid to help me answer this question. 

## Where to find the magic constraint?

Completely inspired by: [Solution Inside your head](http://pradeep90.github.io/The-Solution-in-your-Head.html).

Can someone give you the contraint?  and will you follow it blindly?
Let's say an STM told you to go to the US and that is the ~~purpose~~
constraint of your life, will I do it?

I find myself questioning how he knows it, and I find myself pondering
again about all the pros and cons. If I go to the US then another 3
years of grind is a must to begin with, I can be laid off at any time
bla bla bla...

Even if he gives a reason I don't see myself, having that clarity in
choice that I usually experience when I have a solid constraint like
"having a child" or "EA fanatic constraint".

The whole point of adding constraints is to not debate over what I
should do but this is not helping.

So atleast you won't "blindly" accept any constraint given by
anyone. Last year an STM told me that EA is not my life anymore. 10%
avlo than GL, nu. Naan nambaliyay. It took months of thinking about
this and understanding that it is ok to be mediocre etc. Things don't
internalize that quickly with me :( Even 2-4 weeks after giving up
theism I asked my friend if it was ok to eat outside. Lol.

Probably no?

Some yogi or guru gives you

Someone convinces 

Someone apprently can't give you the constraint ok. 

What about if you find it in place like that of Ra's al Ghul. Same
story.

If someone told me X is a contraint it doesn't just work like that. 

It's tempting to give control to people. But after a point...

thinking about the past and how I got into the "ea constraint" it was
like this. An STM told me about EA and then I read many artcles. The
arguments he made for EA made sense. "I owe it to people". "If not me
who". "I need to be the batman that people deserve" etc. 

Totally made sense. Wait what? How do I know that? How did it "make
sense". What am I doing here?

So X gave me some english words strung in a particular way and I
accepted it. Hmmm. 

I almost seemed to have evaluated if I accept a constraint all myself,
no doubt the arguments were strong (again as per MYSELF). 


It's almost like Iron man coming out. No one know who Iron man is but
that guy who saves everything and suddenly he just pops out. "I AM IRONMAN"

So I can evaluate the constraints. Wait. I am the constraint. 

Truth is I am the constraint... 



## It's inside the head?

The solution space is not unbounded (at least), it's a bit bounded.


## Issues

1. not complete, map
2. biases
3. persuasion
4. changes with time (until last year I judeged a constraint and it
   evolved to completely lacking of a constraint this year lol).
   
I was actively postponing this thinking excercise until a god forsaken
STM FORCED me to do this with his stupid "write a 1k essay within 3
days".

## What could the CITH look like?



## Ideas 

I was thinking about this and it hit me one randomw day. Lol The clues
are more obvious now. SITH FTW.
