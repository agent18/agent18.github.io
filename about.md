This is a collection of an Agents r-word essays version--4 I guess.

I have been extremely erratic with my schedule of writing and have sucked beyond permissible levels until now. ~~Hopefully~~ its in the past and I able to pull my shit together and get the fucking engine running for more than just a few days.

My goals with writing are:
1. To bring back to life the teachings of one Prof.STM that happened 2 years back (with a brief revisits last year).

2. To regain the faith or rather be worthy of his time by showing commitment.

	* He didn't bother to get in touch with me once. He has probably given up. I would like to work with him again and would love the id  of helping each other in this 'Journey'. I also want to write to him, his holy spirit a very heartfelt thank you and sorry. But I cant do that just yet. I have to show him that I am worthy of his time before ever making contact with his excellency. That would mean to write 5 posts in the next 5 days.

3. Talk about motivation, How I bloody well cured my RSI and get some tips from his holy spirit regarding how the fuck does he keep at it, that motherfucker, despite fucking several silly ass-duckweed-retarded-pointless distractions or as some might call it GIRLS!

4. Why it is important to make commitments and so on...

P.S.

Thanks to an ST for his constant words of encouragement and help all through life in various aspects.
