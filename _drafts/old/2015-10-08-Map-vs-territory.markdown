## Entry question: What is Map and territory 
{:.no_toc}

<br>

## History

Lets say you are in 2000 B.C.
I could reach from A to B in a territory in so many routes. Around the mountain, over a mountain etc...

How do you decide which path you should choose. 

a) Travel with a stop watch and measure time 
<br>
b) You can just tread every single path, count the number of footsteps and then...
<br>
c) Or you could make a map by making a few runs and then do all the calculations on the map.

(hint: we are in 2000 B.c and there are no stop watches)

## Map and territory

A Map is an estimate of the actual territory. A Map is what you make of, of your territory. In the above example it appears that maps are constructed to reduce the computation costs.

> Warning: Map is not the actual territory. 

But anyways, Why are we talking about this?

## Brain, its map and the actual territory

You can imagine the brain as a person inside a dark room. This brain is capable of receiving and giving out signals from within the dark room (a.k.a skull). It deploys various sensors (a.k.a organs) to get information about the world, outside of the dark room. It takes this information and _processes_ it and comes up with a map of the actual territory. The map is such an accurate representation of the territory that you can trust the map a 420% (*sarcasm*).

Whenever I say Map and terrirtory I want to realise that I am not just talking about actual regions. As in, the territory, does not just refer to the actual region in the earth.

The territory stands for the reality. Present, past, future. The truth. The absolute truth. The Map stands for everything thats in your head. Everything that your brain came up with via sensors processing the data from the sensors and making its own map, while it is in the dark room (a.k.a skull).

The brain always works with the map it made of the actual territory. I repeat to myself, the brain works with the map and not the territory.

## The analogy break up

There are so many ways you could go from A to B, but which one is the best(shortest). The map is construced not by travelling every fucking path, but by travelling to some points in the territory.

There are so many ways you can do something, but which one is the best thing for you to do. 
The map is constructed not by doing every fucking thing, but by using the built in code called **H&B(hueristics and biases)**, that _cleverly_ constructs the map that is such an accurate representation of the actual reality, that we can totally forget about the territory and allow the map to guide us :) (*sarcasm*).

Again the map is what you make of the territory. 

	$ 	Map != territory

## Introduction to H&B

First things first, the brain has limited resources. By that I mean it does not have infinite computation power. 
The brain doesnt compute the actual territory as it is extremely costly. It uses shortcuts instead.
The brain needs to take into account several million factors in order to come up with the actual reality which can be quite costly.

The cost can be seen in the following manner: Everyperson is just a piece of code, a robot, a computer whatever...  and functions as per the code. But the code is run on limited resources. The world has so many of those persons with code. It doesnt stop with persons there are trillions of other living organisms. 

From the beginning of time(or an initial condition) if we simulated until now and further on using a very very powerful conputer, we can basically predict with high level accuracy the actual territory. The Map can then be an accurate representation of the territory.


But, thats fucking costly. But fret not(I mean fret like fuck! Panick) we have H&B, that are shortcuts and pieces of code in our system that helps us construct the Map.

#### **For example,**
I think I am supposed to do an MS in life. <br>
_Well.... how do you know that_<br>
I looked at others, in my social group. They are all doing an MS. <br>
_Case closed_ H&B FTW	

#### B1

In one of the cases: H and B lets you figure out what you are supposed to be doing in life, by making you feel that you should be doing what the others are doing.

The H&B that was constructed couple of million years ago, when we were in forests, living like the quintessential tribesman, is still in use and hasnt adapted itself to the new age (not that it was pretty epic then). I am passing no judgement on this as of now.

In the forests we need to survive and we are fucked if we go alone to a place. Its probably best to do what the group collectively thinks is cool for lack of better options.

## Conclusion
Anyways, we want go from A to B and would like to know the best way to go from A to B. We do that by treading every single path from A to B, Correct???

We construct a map so that we can cheaply compute the best way to go from A to B.

We want to compute the best course of action for ourselves. We do that by treading every single course of action. Correct???

We construct a map of the reality (territory) our H&B so that we can cheaply compute the BEST (*sarcasm*)  course of action. 

Unfortunately the map is not quite that good. Is it even useable?(later on another post probably). Map in many cases might not be equal to territory. We saw an example of how h&b can be misleading.

Be careful! Until next time this is finally an Agents first post from 'Startup with an STM' section.

## The other side

Yes you know about the Map and the territory. You kept saying that the map is not the territory and rather the brain does a poor job of coming up with an accurate enough map. The prediction power of the reality by the map is quite low for amatuers in a field.

The map need'nt always be wrong. With experience and some other tools the prediction power of the reality, i.e., the  map, can be improved.

For now, Later. Peace!
