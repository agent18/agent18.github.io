## Warning
[ee]:http://agent18.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/10/29/Emperical-Evidence%20.html
I have been warned by an STM against measuring the means and hence, not measuring the end. 'Measuring the end' would mean to measure the final thing that you are interested in. 'Measuring the means' would mean to measure something else other than the end, something you _"think"_   implies measuring the end.

## Measuring the means
Lets say you want to clear GATE entrance exam. The exam is in FEB 2017. You decide to spend 6 hrs a day studying for gate until the exam date. You also recently read and learn't on a trustable site on [emperical evidence][ee], that the only way to know the reality is through Empirical Evidence. I.E., you do not trust your feelings to tell you if you are on the right track or not. So you constantly measure, if you are keeping the time of 6 hrs and you are doing pretty alright according to the graph (GREAT!). You cover all the topics that are there in the syllabus. This is epic. This should work right? Because it is logical, the more time you spend on the topic the better you become at it. And somehow we make the gigantic leap that we can crack gate. Whaaaaat!

## Logical?

Because it is logical! What was that! Why should it work? Just because we use the word logical doesn't make it things right. What is the only thing we trust? EE. Say again. EE. Say once more with me. EE (everybody shouted together). Only EE certifies things as right. For example, Dr.Zakir Naik says 80% of the the Quran matches with science, so the rest 20 % must be true, and he sells it by saying this is logical. Even if by some standard technique 80% of the statements in the Quran is verified to be true, what authority does it give to you to conclude that the rest 20% is right? How the fuck in gods name is that axiomatic? Common think _"logically"_

Another example, Rich Piana a steroid consuming self proclaimed guru of steroids says, "People out there you know nothing, what ever you read is not the answer, you have to experiment...". Until this I am sort of with him, assuming that by _experiment_ he means a proper study like the one that is done to actually test drugs. But then he goes on to say, "The Internet says differently about acg and test shots. Think _logically_, you take ACG, it turns your testosterone on, then you take testosterone shots, which switches off the testosterone. You are sending mixed messages to your body. Body doesn't know what to do. ...". OK!. This is biological chemistry, it is not so trivial that you can tell by thinking _"logically"_ using your heuristics and biases. You simply cant predict what will happen, by thinking _"logically"_. You need to show EE. You can't predict what will happen when you take ACG and testosterone shots, just by thinking 'logically'. 

Ok now, One last time. what is the only thing we trust? EE say again. EE. Say once more with me. EE (everybody shouted together).

## Measuring the end

Coming back. Your goal is to clear GATE. How do you measure then your progress, your ability to crack gate. If not hours per day what else? If not the means what else?

What is the end? The end is to crack gate. You want to know if you can basically solve gate questions in record time. You have the previous years question papers, gate test series etc... Solving these questions in record time can give you hints on how good you are with respect to cracking the gate. The results from these tests would be the tool to measure your progress. So, you study and test yourself and see how you fare and see where all you need to improve and improve in those places. If we are able to do this everything else can go to hell. We only care about the end. We don't care about time spent being less than 6 hours or 8 hrs.

## What now
Measuring the means might work by fluke. There is no reason why it should work. It even appears random. The end in some cases we know, is not one to one related with the means. If this is the case, then we should stay away from assuming measuring the means and the end as the same. When we do not know if measuring the means is the same as measuring the end, then we better stick with measuring the end.

## Meta ethics

Say you want to get into effective altruism. You would want to deeply understand for yourself the key arguments involved, to preempt future road blocks. So you decide to write. You say you will write 300 words a day of final draft quality posts. You do that for a week. You do that for a year. You measure the number of posts you have been writing. Conclude based on that, that you are progressing. Or, We look at how many words the posts have. We decide that all posts with more than 1000 words, increase the counter by 1. Sounds familiar? 

We care about the end. What is the end? The end is to deeply understand the 'n!' key arguments involved in meta ethics. So what we need to measure is clear. We need to measure the number of deeply understood key arguments in meta ethics (as judged by others for objectivity). We only care about this number. We also care about maximizing this number as much as possible as we would like to gain this knowledge(which is a continuous process) as fast as possible and start applying it to our life and make the changes necessary so as to maximize our output keeping the bigger goal for effective altruism in mind(the total value of the world). 

>Now that you have a measure, maximize it like a maniac. There's no limit like one argument per day or anything. This is a game and you need to maximize your score like hell, by whatever means possible. If the number goes up, you're winning. If it's not, you're sucking. End of story.
>-anstm

To that end we display the score board as suggested by an STM on our website, that measures the number of key arguments  clearly explained as judged by others. Are we winning or are we sucking?

## Other Real Life examples 1

Recently the floods happened in chennai. Lot of panic on social media(FB). Lots of statuses and lots of information regarding people stuck here and there and that help was required. I shared a million posts during this period on FB, as they appeared on my newsfeed, with the idea to spread the information. And just sharing the information with a caption to grab peoples attention is all I did. First things first, the impact we hope to see is that action is taken by someone on the posts we share. For example, lets say x is stuck in a house and the water level is rising, and he has no electricity. You share the post, something happens in the mean time and the person being saved is the impact we expect. 

I saw a some people liking and sharing my posts. People who would never normally do that. I saw that the reach of posts was much more than I expected. I continued sharing more and more. I think what happened was that, I measured the means. I did not measure the impact at all. I measured likes and shares, which god only knows whats the correlation between it and the actual impact. Once again, you were measuring the means and making decisions based on that. 

What I could have done is followed the posts on fb, check constantly on the post and see if I can manage some feedback. But I am not sure about the fact  For all we know I could be completely fucking up the process.

## Other Real Life examples 2

So, there is this app called DUOLINGO. Its an app that people use to learn languages. There is this epic(or not) idea with this app called 'streak'.
Everyday you practice the counter goes up. Say you have 20 day streak, i.e., 20 continuous days workout involving 30 xp points a day. I have been doing this. Again I want to learn the language. I want to be able to speak the language. The only reason I found myself practicing everyday was to  be able to atleast keep the streak going. During the past I have lost the streak many times and every time I loose the streak, I basically quit. The very next day you cant find me learning the language. My friend has a 96 day streak now. 

I also am well aware that with time all I did was try and keep up the streak. I am afraid my friend is doing the same thing as well. As long as the streak was there I did'nt care. But is the desired impact being met? Are you measuring the means(streak days) rather than measuring the end (ability to speak german). 

The idea of the streak is to keep you going. Its a means. You should measure the end come what may. Measuring the means is telling us nothing about our progress. Or atleast the link between the means and the end has not been established. We cannot conclude that the means is an effective way to measure the end without EE.

## Other real life examples 3

So I am starting with doing my thesis for the next 9 months. This is a very crucial part of my life. I need to get our some important results and secure myself a job or a phd after, based on this. Expected impact would be to complete the tasks mentioned in the document, a journal paper, getting 8.5 or above in the thesis defense. Solution: I was thinking I should spend 8 hours everyday come what may, or even more and god will take care of the rest. And then I see a problem. Why would you measure time? Why would you measure the means? Why would spending 8 hrs a day guarentee shit. Why!.

Another problem I see with this is, is that it is very easy to get away without actually doing work that would help me get to the goal. Its easy to fake 8 hrs. Time is probably not a point to measure at all.

Maybe I can have milestones that I need to reach with every month. Something that I make with my phd supervisor. The project has an end date and an objective. So if I have milstones by the months and sub milestones by the week and if I meet them sufficiently(based on supervisors feedback) everything else can go to hell. So it does not even matter if I spent 8 hrs a day. I have 9 months only and I have to finish the thesis. So, giddy up I guess.

## Conclusion
The solution is to accurately have a measurement tool that accurately measures what you want to optimize. Measure the end and not the means.
Amen.

## Surprising insights
I was looking for an example outside to quote regarding how it is wrong to measure the means. and Here I find myself ridiculing what I have been doing before. I don't have to convince people to measure the end. People have to convince me to measure the means. Why would it be right? Why should you take someones word for it... Or in other words where is my EE. Amen.

The whole bit on the word logical.
