# Life Quotes

>"Don't organize your folders, let your desktop be clustered with files of all possible sizes, don't bother if those icons camouflage with your favorite wallpaper. It doesn't matter if your pillow slips outside its cover. It doesn't really matter if your slippers are almost inside your room. Nor does it if the t-shirt you ordered online does not look the way you thought it would be or if your room is dirty and your stuff is **messy**. Open the door, go out, close it and walk... Happiness is outside your small apartment. It is in what you write, the movies you watch, the food you eat, the places you visit and the people who you talk to. ‪#‎liketobeclean‬but ‪#‎hatekeepingitclean‬ "

# Are the above statements true?


_Let me rephrase that, do you think if you have a girlfriend life will be great?_

YES.

_Why?_

Because you are a man. You evolutionarily crave for women. Once you have women then life will be great. Imagine having sex and all that.

_Will this be accepted as a response in a science journal. A peer reviewed highly acclaimed journal!_

I guess not. 

_Why?_

# Emperical Evidence


Objective information usually from experiments. It should be possible that these experiments can be replicated.

# Why are respected science journals supposed to be the truth, reality?

They are peer reviewed, not based on feelings, but on facts. Matter created in the journal is backed up by proofs. Matter other than the one that is created is refered to a previous journal. statements like in the beginning cannot pass through a journal as there is not proof to back them up. Unless we have proof they will not be accepted into science journals.

_So what, why are we talking about journals_

Because they are the closest we can get to reality.

_Why do we care about reality_

Because it helps us make better decisions.

For example,

If you think that having a girl friend will change your life 10x and then it doesnt. But you spent 20 years of your life trying to get a girlfriend.

With more prediciton power of the reality comes better judgement.

# In conclusion

It is important that we are not carried away by how we feel towards a statement. Unless there is EE of the correctness of the statement, how can you trust a statement.
