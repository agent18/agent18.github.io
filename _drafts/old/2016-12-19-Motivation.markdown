#### **Entry question** : 

With this post I want to discover and clarify for myself as to why I should be doing something that I think I should be doing.


#### **What should you be doing?**

I was handed some knowledge 2 years back which was polished last year during august (courtesy STM). Been "busy" with masters and finding a job. Now that I finally found a job -which was the official excuse for not taking pretty much any action during the last 2 years- what should I be doing and why should I be doing it.
#### **Why should you be doing**
1) batman begins,  its not who you are but what you do that defines you!

2) solution inside your head

3) martin seligman

4) peter singer

5) thats why its so important, it separates us from them

6) what about being a social whore?
