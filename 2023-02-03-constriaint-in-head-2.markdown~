## Constraints make decisions easy

In the [last essay](/how-to-be-happy-constraints.html), we talked about how ~~purpose~~ constraints
help us make decisions so easily. When I had the "EA constraint" (save
as many lifes as possible), it was very easy for me to decide what to
do. Go to the US? Hell's yeah. It makes more money. 

A lack of said contraint, completely leaves me (and I assume others as
well) baffled and incapable of making a decision. The solution space
to life's questions seem unbounded. Currently without any constraint, I
am struggling to figure out if I should go the US or stay in the
Netherlands.

No amount of pros and cons list seem to help. Pros being, I can make
in 10 years what I can never dream to make in Netherlands... The cons
being I will probably have "less time" to engage in my passions like
climbing or music etc., (at least for the next 3 years until I
establish myself)...

Despite these pros and cons I don't know what to do. How do I even
compare? And even if I manage to "somehow compare", am I going to
accept the results? My past indicates that there will never be a solid
decision coming out of this. In the end you will just have to pick one
and commit.

**Entry Question:** Is there a constraint (or a set of constraints)
that I can apply to reduce the solution space to get to a resounding
YES/NO? If so, where is that constraint? What does it look like? How
do I find them?

## Where is that constraint?

*Note: Completely inspired by: [Solution Inside your head](http://pradeep90.github.io/The-Solution-in-your-Head.html).*

I am not interested in adding a "random constraint" like "marrying" or
"having a kid" just so that I feel a ~~purpose~~ constraint and can
make decisions easily. I would like something better than randomly
choosing a constraint.

Perhaps, can someone wise give me the contraint? Let's say an STM came
to me and said "you should go the US and work hard". He provides me
the constraint. Will I abide by it?

Participating in this thought experiement, I find myself questioning
how he knows this constraint, and I find myself eventually pondering
again about all the pros and cons. (If I go to the US then another 3
years of grind is a must to begin with, I can be laid off at any time
bla bla bla...)

The whole point of adding constraints is to have an easy way out, to
make decisions easily. Engaging in further debate after the constraint,
seems to defeat the purpose of using a constraint in the first place.

So, "random constraint" is out of question. Blindly accepting a
constraint from a wise person is also out of question. But then, how
did I get constraints in the past?

## It's inside the head

An STM told me about EA many years back. The arguments he made for EA
were: "I owe it to people"; "If not me, who will do it"; "I need to
be the batman that people deserve" etc.

Totally made sense. Wait what? How do I know that? How did it "make
sense". What am I doing here? X gave me some english words strung in a
particular way and I accepted it? It seems as though I evaluated it
and accepted it as a "proper" constraint.

Not only that, I also reject the constraints despite accepting them in
the past. Last year after a really long discussion with an STM it
happened that I rejected the "EA constraint". I "carefully" judged the
constraint in the new light provided to me and it was time to reject
it.

I evaluate the constraint. I don't need people to tell me about what
constraint to choose. Hell, I AM THE CONSTRAINT. THE CONSTRAINT IS IN
MY HEAD.

## Characteristics of this constraint

The constraints in the head need some type of unlocking. Until an STM
told me about EA and the lifestyle, I didn't know nothing about it. If
not for him, I would have lead a completely different life with
different constraints. 

This means we don't know all our constriants and can still discover
them.

It can change with time (meaning we can get the constraint
wrong). Until last year the "ea constraint" was valid but today it's
not.

It is hard to come up with and apply constraints. I am here thinking
about the constraints in my head and what constraints are in my head
that will help me make a decision about whether I should go to the US
or not. Some constraints come up, such as "I need to live long and
happy". I am not debating it. I am happy I came up with it. I agree
with it wholeheartedly. But it is not easy to evaluate which path
leads to "long and happy".

## Ideas

"Constraint is inside your head" clicked a few days back. And I knew
that would be the essay even before writing.

One constraint to apply for the questions I have: "I want to live long
and happy".
