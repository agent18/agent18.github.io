      <p>decision making</p>

      <p>alias paradox</p>

      <p>But suppose, instead, that your example for decision-making was that
you had to choose between a job in <company A=""> with less salary but
better promotion prospects than <company B="">. Now, he could test the
claim about "consulting experienced guys" - yeah, they could tell
you roughly how much difference the extra promotion prospects would
make (assuming he had a concrete example for "experienced guys", but
we can assume that for our purposes). And he would reject the claim
that "meditation for 20 minutes would help your decision-making" by
saying that he really doesn't have even one example for it as he
doesn't see how that will help him decide between extra salary and
extra promotion prospects. He's not saying the claim is false; he's
just saying that he hasn't seen a single example for it, let alone a
ton of empirical evidence.</company></company></p>

    <p>Identify what the text is not saying! the text for an example to
pass a claim is that it should have atleast one example!</p>

    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(A job)[24b] will be (best)[24a] (for learning)[24] when you
are (pushed)[25] to (improve)[26] and get (lots)[27] of
(feedback from mentors)[28].</p>

        <p>My friend currently works in Apple after he had an ivy league
schooling in the US. Previously he worked in Mu Sigma a company
in India, catering to the fortune 500 in the field of Data
Science[24b]. He and several others who left their job in Mu
Sigma 2 years later, are in some kickass positions now in the
US[24a,24]. He often worked long hours and was under a lot of
pressure to deliver[25,26] for the fortune 500 companies. Even
on holiday trips he had his laptop to do meetings to make
changes or inform his findings[27,28].</p>

        <p>squeezed lots of feedback together? Should have I done it
separately? can you show me how?</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Get a concrete example and test the claim:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>(A job will be best for learning)[1] when (you are pushed to
improve)[2] and (get lots of feedback from mentors)[3].</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The claim is [1].</p>

      <p>An example for [2] is your friend who apparently was pushed to
improve. It‚Äôs not clear if the claim is that you need both [2]
and [3] to get [1] or if they will independently add to [1].</p>

      <p>An example for [3] is again your friend.</p>

      <p>Now test the claim. You can see that, yes, he apparently did
learn a lot. But is it ‚Äúbest for learning‚Äù? How the fuck do you
test that claim? What evidence do they have for that? That would
involve comparing against all other types of jobs for learning
and ensuring that a job that gives [2] and [3] is ‚Äúbest‚Äù. That,
in my opinion, is poor writing. But what do I know?</p>

      <p>Contrast that to saying that you will learn more at such a job
even if you earn less. You can think of concrete examples for
that, such as friends who work for low salaries at startups but
learn a fuckton about distributed systems and reproducible
builds because they have to do it all by themselves. (Again,
this is far from an empirical study of the entire industry, but
one test &gt; zero tests. And one test that you do right away &gt; a
hundred perfect tests that you never do.) If some guy says that
startup jobs are useless because they pay much lower than big
company jobs, what can you do? You can test it instantly against
the concrete example you have - nope, a friend learned a lot and
went on to better jobs because of his better skills even though
the startup paid less.</p>

      <p>Can you feel the difference between just reading the statement
‚ÄúA job will be best for learning when you are pushed to improve
and get lots of feedback from mentors‚Äù and sort of agreeing with
the general idea (it sounds reasonable after all) versus testing
it against an actual example? Did you notice the gaping flaw in
the claim ‚Äúbest for learning‚Äù? That is the sort of thing I claim
you are likely to see only when you test against a concrete
example. (An example for <strong>this</strong> claim is the episode above,
where you had missed it when not testing the claim against an
example and where you could see it after I pointed out a
concrete test.)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similar to the previous sentence about ‚Äúbetter‚Äù we again have an issue
as highlighted below.</p>

    <blockquote>

        <p>(This)[1] (has led)[2] to some engaged users to (focus on options

best early career options if you‚Äôre focused on our top problems
areas)[6].</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The claim is [2] (along with [3], [4], [5], and [6]). You have to
test that the claim passes for at least one example for [1].</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, [1] = wanting to gain ‚Äúcareer capital‚Äù early in your
career, which is God-knows-what. The Dutch guy who has never heard
of the term ‚Äúcareer capital‚Äù, just like 99% of the Earth‚Äôs
population, just throws up his hand and says that he is simply not
able to think of a concrete example for that.</p>

      <p>Anyway, if [1] were such that you could get a concrete example for
it, you would do that and check if there is at least somebody who
wanted to gain ‚Äúcareer capital‚Äù early in his career and therefore
went for consulting [3], somebody who wanted that and therefore went
for software engineering [4], and somebody who was like that and
therefore went for tech entrepreneurship [5]. (If they don‚Äôt have a
concrete example of someone who wanted to gain ‚Äúcareer capital‚Äù
early in his career and therefore went for ‚Äútech entrepreneurship‚Äù,
why did they mention it?)</p>

      <p>Next, you would test if it is indeed ‚Äúrarely the best early career
options if‚Ä¶‚Äù [6] by checking if each of the above three examples
are ‚Äúrarely the best early career options‚Äù. Again, that‚Äôs hard to
test because you have to show some career option that is much
‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the ones above (along which dimension? Money?
Promotion prospects? #!&amp;$*@ ‚ÄúCareer capital‚Äù? Progress along our
‚Äútop problem areas‚Äù? Hard to say, but it wasn‚Äôt I who wrote that
sentence). It would be much easier to test if their claim was that
it would lead to lower lifetime earnings than someone who did
something else. Then, you could get the lifetime earnings for [4]
and the lifetime earnings for the alternative and check if the
former is lower. See how much clearer that is?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>For [1], we can think of the equation of the POVW used to identify the
relationship between force (F) and stiffness (k) for the truss problem
below.</p>

\[\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2 = F\times\delta y\]

<p><img src="./images/images-DP-3/truss.jpg" alt="truss example" /></p>

<p>For [2]: determining the force F at equilibrium for a given stiffness</p>

<p>For [3]: Energy of a spring, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2$</code></p>

<p>For [4]: Work done by the Force F, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$F\times\delta y$</code></p>

<p>For [5]: It‚Äôs easy to see that F increases then k increases in the
above equation.</p>

<p>Contrast this to vector mechanics, where we have to write atleast 6
equations (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\Sigma Fx=0$, $\Sigma Fy=0$ &amp; $\Sigma M=0$</code> (2x)). In
these equations we also have the reaction forces at A and C involved,
and the internal forces in the truss members. We can solve all this
and get a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(geometry, reaction force, internal force,
stiffness)=0</code> from which it will not be as handy to see the effect of
stiffness on the force F; as compared to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(geometry, Force, Stiffness)=0</code></p>

<p>For [6]: relation between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F &amp; k</code>. F is directly proportional to k.</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>{(The analytical approach)[1] to (mechanics)[2] is based on the
(concepts of energy)[3] and (work)[4]}(A)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the example approach below[1] we see the usage of energy[3] and work[4] to
identify the relationship between F and k[2].</p>

\[\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2 = F\times dy\]

<blockquote>
  <p>The analytical approach based on the concepts of energy and work
(provides a better understanding)[5] of (mechanical
phenomena)[6]}(B)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>F increases, then k increases based on the analytical approach. When
you contrast this to vector mechanics, you see that it is hard to see
the relationship between F &amp; k, due to the presence of reaction and
internal forces.</p>

\[\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2 = F\times dy\]

<p>For 1 &amp; 5: we imagine a simple pendulum</p>

<p>For 2, We imagine the pendulum like below making an S shape between
two points A and B on the spherical surface</p>

<p><img src="./images/images-DP-3/sph-pendulum.png" alt="sph-pendulum" /></p>

<p>For 3, we imagine the same pendulum making a C shape between the same
A and B</p>

<p>For 4a, we think of the 2 distinct trajectories [2] and [3].</p>

<p>For 4: I hear people say it is an ‚Äúinfinitesimal‚Äù displacement. I see
it as something that houses the direction information (tangents) as shown
above. And then I go to the equations straight.</p>

<p>The VD can also be split into X and Y components, displacement
in the X direction is given by $u_2=L \sin{\theta}$, the virtual
displacement is given by differentiating as $\delta u_2=L
\cos{\theta}$.</p>

supposed to look like, when I think of a pendulum, I don‚Äôt understand
what it means to subtract two paths and say that this is the virtual

<p>For 6, I don‚Äôt know how to get $\delta u_2=L \cos{\theta}$, from [2]
and [3] as shown in figure 1.1 above. How when you subtract 2
trajectories you get the virtual displacement.</p>

<p>So, there seem to be <strong>2 claims</strong>:</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know how [2] and [3] allow for the definition of [4]. How
subtracting any 2 random trajectories is supposed to give the virtual

<p>I have not one example for this. It is the same as previous claim.</p>

<p><em>I spent &gt;2 hrs on this particular part and was not able to produce

<p>For 10, we imagine the pendulum going from mean position to say

<p>For 11, the difference in trajectories at $\theta=0^\circ$ &amp;
$\theta=30^\circ$ are equal to 0.</p>

reaction force.</p>

<p>For 14, we imagine a string allowing the ball to move only along a

<p>For 15, The tension force is responsible for holding the ball at L by
providing an equal and opposite force to gravity (in the mean position)</p>

<p>For 16, we write out the kinematic constraint as $r=L$</p>

<p>When there is a string and the ball is hanging, there are immediately
Tension forces (reaction forces) in the string.</p>

<p>The tension force[12] is responsible for holding the ball at L by

<p>@ $r=L$, $T=mg$ for the case of the pendulum</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those (reaction forces)[18] are (not known in advance)[19] since

<p>For 18, we imagine the tension in the string</p>

<p>For 19, the reaction forces in the below equation are unknown. They
need to be computed solving for the following dynamic equilibrium
equations given $\theta$ and accelerations.</p>

<p>Y : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1} = 0$</code> <br />
X : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2} = 0$</code></p>

<p>So there is a different tension force depending on whether the
pendulum is rising against gravity from the mean position or falling
from a height towards the mean position.</p>

<p>When the pendulum is just dropped from 45 degrees, the acceleration is
0 at that point, and the tension = 7 N</p>

<p>When the pendulum is at the mean position without any acceleration
i.e, $\theta = 0^\circ$ then T=10N</p>

<p>For 20, \theta and \ddot{u} inform us about the motion; if theta is 0
and the acceleration is &gt;0 then it means that the pendulum is going to
move against gravity.</p>

<p>For 20a, $T = f(\theta $ and $ \ddot{u})$ (as in the dynamic
equilibrium equations)</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong></p>

<blockquote>

save 24 lives per year <a href="https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/">(97k$/4k$/life)</a> as a conservative estimate.</p>

<p>For 4, I imagine living in a house 300 euros cheaper than my current one, I
don‚Äôt eat outside, I don‚Äôt go to India, I save as much money as I can
(in my current case, that would amount to 8-10k  donations).</p>

<p>For 5, I imagine clocking 4 hrs a day on DP for Data Science and
becoming worthy of Google placement in US which possibly would earn
200k$;</p>

<p>For 6, we imagine donating &gt;35% of 200k per year after 5 years which
