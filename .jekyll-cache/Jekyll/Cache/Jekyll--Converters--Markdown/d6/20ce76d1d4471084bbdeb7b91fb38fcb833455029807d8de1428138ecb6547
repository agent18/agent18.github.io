I"ê<p><strong>What is long term EC</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>having a residence permit as a long-term resident EC allows you to
apply more easily for a residence permit in one of the other EU
countries that also have this residence permit. You do have to meet
the conditions which that country has for the residence permit.</p>

<p><strong>Dutch PR vs citizenship</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Really depends what you are looking. If you are looking for
flexibility to travel for work or pleasure, you should get a Dutch
passport. The OCI card from India gives you the same options as an
Indian passport except being able to run for office and own
agricultural land.-<a href="https://www.quora.com/Would-you-recommend-an-Indian-living-in-the-Netherlands-to-apply-for-a-residence-permit-or-for-a-passport">Quora-Pr-vs-citizenship</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>the biggest disadvantage to it is that it won‚Äôt let me live/work in
other EU countries.-<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/4nqlww/citizen_vs_permanent_residency/">Reddit</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Permanent Resident (PR): You get a Residence Permit that will let you
stay in Netherlands indefinitely. The PR will become invalid only
when you stay out of Netherlands for more than 1 year continuously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bypassing my problems</strong></p>

<p>Apply for PR and apply for passport simultaneously. I am confident I
will get a PR. It will take me atleast 3 years from now to receive it
in hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dutch Citizenship: You can surrender your Indian passport and get a
Netherlands passport.  The prerequisites for citizenship and PR are
same ‚Äì only that PR takes about 2 months to arrive from the time you
apply for it while the passport will take about 1 year. So a lot of
Indians apply for the PR and also apply for the passport in parallel.

<blockquote>
  <p>It is possible to apply for PR and Citizenship at the same time!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People have gotten their Citizenship rejected and Pr not as in the
same post above, for not meeting the requirements. However, appeals
can be made. I need to write soem FB posts and check with others
regarding what works and not.</p>

<p><strong>Q&amp;A in the website</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://indiansinnetherlands.com/my-experiences/dutch-citizenship/">Indians in Netherlands Citizenship</a> is gold.</p>

<p>Masoud: What do they check when applying for citizenship? RP
records/gemente records?</p>

<p>Suri: Only if you de-register it is a problem, otherwise, it is not!</p>

<p>Mostly my case but it is risky considering I was not in the country.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In case you decide to go back and live in India as a Dutch citizen,
you can live like an Indian citizen except that you cannot vote. You
can reapply for Indian passport after 5yrs of change to Dutch
passport and 1 year of continuous living in India. - <a href="http://indiansinnetherlands.com/my-experiences/dutch-citizenship/">Indians in

<blockquote>
  <p>Because India issues OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) card, you do not
sacrifice your India relationship in terms of access or decision to
go back for good -  - <a href="http://indiansinnetherlands.com/my-experiences/dutch-citizenship/">Indians in
