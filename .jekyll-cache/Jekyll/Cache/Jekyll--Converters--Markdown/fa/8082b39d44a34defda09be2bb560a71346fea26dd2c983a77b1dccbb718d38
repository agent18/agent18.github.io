<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Agent,</p>

  <p>I didn‚Äôt see the lifetime impact of the data science path. What has
been the growth rate of ‚Äúimpact‚Äù for the two career paths as people
got promoted or started new ventures? What are you assuming it will
be?</p>

  <p>Related: How many years of career are you assuming? That along with
the growth rate would point to the lifetime ‚Äúimpact‚Äù. That total would
be a better indicator of the expected value of some gamble like
Master‚Äôs degree and H1B visa. For example, 8 years of a grind even
starting at 30 may be worth the remaining 27 years of high pay
compared to 35 years of what seems less risky but lower-paying.</p>

  <p>For how many years will you be allowed to work in a given country? Can
you go back to Europe or is it back to India after that?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The probabilities are sub 50% for success in either cases. In case I
fail to make it to the US, I am stuck with very low ETG (5-10k).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Also look at other options that may have a higher acceptance rate for
permanent residency and work options, even if they have lower overall
compensation. Canada, Australia, other European countries, etc. Also
India.</p>

  <p>Then there‚Äôs the cost of living in different places. For example,
Seattle has pretty high salaries and lower cost of living than the Bay
Area.</p>

  <p>In other words, when I hear ‚Äúlifetime impact‚Äù, I expect to see
lifetime calculations. Doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect, but has to consider
the total career. A very crude one would be the total given some
starting salary and some growth rate over X years of career. A more
detailed one would be an average salary (or ‚Äúimpact‚Äù) of X1 for 5
years and X2 for the next 10 years and so on, and then calculating the
sum over the career.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>My plan is to roughly first move to DS ASAFP (3-6 months) and start
‚Äúclocking‚Äù DS hours on the side (9-5 job). I will spend the next few
years (0-5 years) focusing on gaining R skills, research skills
needed for EA and try my luck at breaking into EA ‚Äúin a way that
creates a lot of impact‚Äù. (It took 5 years for Peter Hurford to
start his own org.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What is the opportunity cost of doing the above mix vs data science
full-time?</p>

<h2 id="entry-question">Entry question</h2>

<p>What should I do next? Should I go for a Master‚Äôs? Should I upskill for
EA Orgs? Introducing Lifetime impact calculations.</p>

<h2 id="ea-jobs-have-high-impact-in-research">EA jobs have high impact in Research</h2>

<p>I am going to try making a lifetime impact calculation (very rough)
based on <a href="https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/">Milan Griffes attempt here</a>. <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/afDCCvCsZcz8axoPp/examples-for-impact-of-working-at-eaorg-instead-of-etg">People seem hesitant to
make such calculations</a> for some reason. And somehow they are able
to make decisions without these. All I want to do is just see if it is
even worth spending time to be a researcher in the <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting">already crowded
space</a> (OPPs recent hiring round).</p>

<p>GiveWell moved 110m<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> in 2015. An entry level researcher‚Äôs
contribution is expected to be <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/05/givewells-progress-in-2015/">10% of a co-founder</a>. Over a
lifetime I find it hard to believe that one will be stuck at 10% of
the co-founder contribution. With time one would move up the ladder
and on average <em>I assume</em> one is at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">30%</code> the co-founder
contribution. GiveWell employed <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/05/givewells-progress-in-2015/">9 co-founders</a> that year. So we
get a multiplying factor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.3/9</code>.</p>

<p>Just like we divide the impact of the org among the different people,
it seems appropriate that we should also divide the impact of the 110m
that GiveWell moves, among the following: the Donors (e.g., Good
Ventures), the middle men (GiveWell) and the intervention Orgs
(AMF). The impact from the 110m<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> seems to belong to each of these
Orgs. <em>I assume</em> all Orgs have equal weight in this, for lack of any
other better estimate. So we get a multiplying factor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.33</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Replaceability of org</strong></p>

<p>Now we get into counterfactual estimates of the org itself. What is
the utility to the world if GiveWell existed, minus when they didn‚Äôt
exist. I don‚Äôt know how to estimate this but it appears <a href="https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/fnBnEiwged7y5vQFf/triple-counting-impact-in-ea/comment/CWxdafynvn3nQ7v9b">80000hours
uses a factor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;=0.3</code></a> to estimate their counterfactual impact. We
shall roll with this, for lack of any better estimate. So <em>we assume</em>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.3</code> again.</p>

<p>So far the Impact for a researcher at GiveWell is estimated to be
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.3/9x0.33x0.3x110m=363k</code>. This final value is TOO sensitive to any
changes in the factors listed above. For example, if the ‚ÄòContribution
of the Org‚Äô, changed from 0.3 to 0.4, then the outcome increases by
about 100k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> to 484k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Replaceability of person</strong></p>

<p>Counterfactual estimates for the impact created by a person in an EA
job, is the difference in impact between, when he takes the job and
when he doesn‚Äôt. This is quite hard to predict. It not only depends on
the next candidate who didn‚Äôt get this job, but what that next
candidate did (spillover-effects). ‚ÄúDid he end up displacing other
people in EA?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat happened in the rest of the displacement chain?‚Äù
etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Depending on the situation this can vary from 0 to 363k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>. Imagine a
job opening where anyone who meets a ‚Äúvery high bar‚Äù can get that
research position as there are enough funds for it. Such a person
seems to take credit for all of the 363k. However, imagine a case
where there are 2 similarly skilled people for one job that was
open. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> gets the job and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> can do ETG but can donate only a few
100<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> a year. This makes the counterfactual impact of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> = 100<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>.</p>

<p>In reality there are many people and it is hard to trace the actual
impact. Attempting to make estimates seems to need a lot more
assumptions which I am unable to back up with data or examples. Moving
on!</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>It appears that EA work has a lot of potential to do good ranging from
0k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> to even &gt;363k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>. My problem is there is a lot of uncertainty. And
this number could be extremely high (even in millions) depending on
the type of work one chooses and how much better he is than others.</p>

<p>It takes <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but">a few years to break into EA</a>. For Peter, apparently it
took him 5 years of hardwork to get to founding his own org. MSJ, to
get an internship in CE, took 2-4 years and quite some hardwork
(writing your own research, showing up at EA conferences, criticizing
research etc‚Ä¶). For Saulius, it took about 2 years and 2
internships.</p>

<p>I recently apped for an internship and didn‚Äôt get it. I probably need
to work on it for a few years and copy actions of these examples. In
addition I really suck at understanding claims, so add a few more
years!</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It could take about 2-5 years and ‚Äúa lot of hard work‚Äù
before I get into an EA org. The counterfactual impact ‚Äúdepends‚Äù. The
chances for success are unknown, and its getting quite competitive as
expressed in the acceptance rates.</p>

<h2 id="ds-for-etg">DS for ETG</h2>

<p>I am going to focus on DS instead of CS, for DS involves ‚Äúcritical
thinking‚Äù, working with statistics, working with claims, hypothesis
testing etc.‚Äìthings that seem to help become a better EA researcher
(in case I need them in the future). Also Earning potential wise, it
appears there is not ‚Äúmuch difference‚Äù (<a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/which-is-more-promising-data-science-or-software-engineering-7e425e9ec4f4">looking at the average
salaries</a>). So we stick with DS.</p>

<p>Earning potential is quite high in the US. Earnings are substantially
larger than here in Netherlands (or Europe). I know DS people with
4yoe in Apple California earning 300k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> TC and others in Walmart with
300k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> TC. While here (Netherlands) people seem to be <a href="https://www.glassdoor.nl/Salarissen/Booking-com-Data-Scientist-Amsterdam-Salarissen-EJI_IE256653.0,11_KO12,26_IL.27,36_IM1112.htm?experienceLevel=ONE_TO_THREE">earning
78-103k</a> as per Glassdoor. With such salaries as in the US there
are people like (<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/donations">Jeff Kaufman</a>) who are able to donate 50%. This
amounts to about 150k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> per year with a 300k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> TC.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways many people I know take, to get to the US. People
take the masters route, and then work towards an H1B visa which allows
you to work there. The other route is the L1 route. In this case you
work in say Amazon in India (for e.g.,) and then try to move to the US
on an L1.</p>

<p><strong>Chances are low to make it in the US</strong></p>

<p>There are random factors associated with working in US. Getting an H1B
is based on lottery. Whether you are doing an L1 or Masters in the US,
you end up having to deal with H1B at some point‚Äìeither after
Master‚Äôs or before your L1 expires (&lt;5years). There seems to be a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">60%</code> chance that a person like me will clear this hurdle <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This
is including atleast 3 tries at H1B (i.e., 1-3 years of applying).</p>

<p>In addition, the US is not the most friendly place for workers
rights. Once you loose a job you have <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/just-got-laid-off-h-1b-job-i-any-grace-period-can-i-another-visa-jobhunt.html">60 days to find another
job</a>. In
times of recession (like in 2008 or during the Corona period), the
chance of loosing the job seems to be about 15%<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and might mean a
one way ticket back to home. This comes to a multiplying factor of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">89%</code>.</p>

<p>For Master‚Äôs route, I think I have ‚Äúgood‚Äù chances of getting a DS job
in FAANG with 2-3 yoe (not including the H1B chances). I have seen
examples of people in FAANG whom I know well, and thus think it is
definitely within reach comparing myself to them. Worst case it should
be possible to atleast get a DS job in California, from where I can
grow into FAANG. People are able to do bootcamps and join DS from
different industries such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashankmaiya/">Electrical Engineering</a>. This
suggests to me that it is definitely not out of reach. Let‚Äôs put this
at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">80%</code>. So in total, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">60%x89%x80%=42%</code> chance of making it.</p>

<p>For the L1 route, the biggest hurdle would be to find a company that
is L1-able. There are examples I have come across, across fields and
countries. There are people who went all the way to JP Morgan in New
York on an L1 after a few years in India and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramshandilya/">SWe engineers from India
who are now in FAANG</a>. <del>People demanding a job in US because they
are good and pushing for a job there.</del> Atleast for mechanical
background, people from ASML Netherlands regularly work in the US for
a few years on L1. It seems accessible. I have to look into the
possibilities more for DS people in Netherlands. Say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">60-80%</code>
chance. So in total, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">32%</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">42%</code>.</p>

<p><strong>DS Costs (time and money)</strong></p>

<p>With the Master‚Äôs route based on examples I have seen, 4 to 6 years to
a FAANG 300k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> TC job (2-4 yoe + 2y for masters). With the L1 route 2-3
yoe + 2-5 years before getting H1B transfer. So, 4-8 years from now.</p>

<p>With the regular masters route, I would have to spend 50-70k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> at a
public university and mostly can‚Äôt work during that time‚Äìbecoming a
total of 70-90k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> (including the opportunity costs). With the L1 route,
I think I have to do an online masters (estimated at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7o21qw/berkeley_master_data_science_mids_vs_other_online/">20k</a> for 2
years) atleast to be able to defend an RFE<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and also to improve
chances with H1B<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. But I will be working during that time and can
cover my costs as it will be part time.</p>

<p><strong>Forget spending 2 hrs a day on things related to EA</strong></p>

<p>With the Master‚Äôs route, combined with my actual 9-5 job I think there
is not going to be much time until I reach FAANG. Starting with a DS
Masters implies that for the next 4-7 years I will be investing all my
resources on making it into FAANG. First I start with GRE, get a job
here (NL) in DS, work out the universities, apply, send documents,
talk to people about where to go etc. During Master‚Äôs I think I will
tend to spend all my time to get better grades and work on DS, and
apply for jobs. I would want to do everything in my power to learn
skills needed and get good grades to maximize my chances. Until I
reach FAANG, I would be doing things that can improve my chances.</p>

<p>With the L1 route, I think the same holds too. If I end up working in
Netherlands and doing a masters part-time, there is going to be no
time. Forget spending 2 hrs a day. Once I get to the US on L1 I will
be working on getting an H1B type job. That would be the focus. So
both cases I guess that spending time to build ‚ÄúEA related skills‚Äù is
gonna be hard during the time leading to FAANG.</p>

<p><strong>When I fail</strong></p>

<p>The probabilities are sub 50% for success in either cases. In case I
fail to make it to the US, I am stuck with very low ETG (5-10k). And
furthermore it is going to be much harder to start my journey into
EA. I will be in my 33-36‚Äôs and I am afraid its gonna be ‚Äúharder‚Äù
than now as I would have passed several ‚Äúcrucial years‚Äù (4-7) where I
could have spent learning ‚Äúskills related to an EA‚Äù.</p>

<p>In the Master‚Äôs case this seems to imply that I could be in debt of
50-70k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> in case things don‚Äôt work out (worst-case). This means that I
have to pay my debt for another 5-7 years before I can potentially ETG
again. For the L1 case, atleast I am not in going to be in debt.</p>

<p>Considering the debt part alone and the reduced anxiety due to that, I
would prefer the L1 route. It is still unclear what the chances are
with meeting an L1-able company. L1 on the other hand also allows you
to gain a few years (2-4y) experience before applying to FAANG
(increasing the chances). However, in theory if someone pays for my
Master‚Äôs (my brother perhaps) and I had ‚Äúexperience‚Äù (of 2-3 years),
then <strong>both options are ‚Äúalmost‚Äù the same.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><strong>DS route</strong></p>

<p>The Impact with DS seems to be high in the order of 150k (and more
maybe) donations. Getting a job in the US seems to be coming in with a
probability of less than 50% (most of which are not in my control) be
it Master‚Äôs or be it the L1 route .</p>

<p>If this path is chosen, there is a ‚Äúgood chance‚Äù that I am unable to
sink my teeth into up-skilling myself in other things such as EA
(during the 4-8 years of pursuing this path).</p>

<p>I would be in my 33-36‚Äôs if I crash and burn. I am afraid its gonna be
‚Äúmuch harder than now‚Äù to try EA as I would have passed several
crucial years (4-7) where I could have spent learning skills related
to an EA.</p>

<p><strong>EA route</strong></p>

<p>So far we have seen that breaking into EA can take 2-5 years and a
‚Äúlot of hard work‚Äù. The probabilities for success are unclear, but the
impact seems to have a lot of potential i.e., &gt;350k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> (the lower
limit could be as low as few k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>; very hard to estimate currently).</p>

<p>If this path is chosen, it means that I still need a day job (25-40
hrs). Continuing to work on my usual MechE job is possible until a
time that I am able to move to EA full-time.</p>

<p>In case I crash and burn, then all I have is some skills that possibly
wont help me in ETG. MechE is a low paying job. And moving to DS will
be ‚Äúmuch harder than now‚Äù. So I am delayed by 2-5 years in getting
started with DS.</p>

<p><strong>The path that has it all?</strong></p>

<p>Having to restart after 4-8 years ‚Äúsounds like a bad idea‚Äù. I will be
older in my 34s to 38s, and am not sure about how it is perceived and
if I can get a master‚Äôs at that time, if I can move jobs etc. Also
learning skills is supposed to be harder in some cases as you move to
a middle age (37-48)<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>However there seems to be a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù route. Instead of uselessly
clocking time on MechE, and not having back-up options, I could first
quickly change to a DS job (3-6 months). From there on I could pursue
EA route in the evenings and weekends, while I still clock DS
time. Granted I wont become great at DS but I will have yoe atleast,
and when I crash and burn, I wont be starting anything from scratch.</p>

with many H1B sponsors for the same year with different employers. So
lets assume I have 3 tries for now.</p>

      <p>Based on a 50% split between the general pool and the advanced pool
(<a href="https://www.happyschools.com/h1b-visa-2020-probability-lottery/">which is what the DHS have assumed</a>), we see that 1 H1B attempt
has a <a href="https://bintlr.work/h1bProbabilityEstimate.html">41.9% chance of success</a> for students with Masters.</p>

      <p>After you are selected in the lottery, you are either approved or
rejected or requested for an <a href="https://goh1b.com/en/blog/2019/07/02/what-does-h1b-rfe-mean-most-common-reasons/">RFE</a>. The cases for RFE have become
‚Äúmuch higher‚Äù <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2019/08/08/latest-uscis-data-show-increase-in-denials-for-new-h-1b-visas/#5443e3417cc4">(33% in 2019 from 10% in

over the trump era. One of the things they seem to be scrutinizing
the people is for not
having the <strong>right background/experience for the work</strong>. This comes
under ‚ÄúBeneficiary qualifications‚Äù. Naturally, this scares me as I
have a mechanical Master‚Äôs and Bachelor‚Äôs. Another common reason
issued by the USCIS is called ‚ÄúSpeciality Occupation‚Äù. The <strong>position needs to qualify as
a speciality occupation</strong>. Apparently <a href="https://ogletree.com/insights/uscis-issues-top-10-reasons-for-h-1b-requests-for-evidence/">USCIS does not usually think a
job is ‚Äúspecial enough‚Äù, if they don‚Äôt have the need for a 
relevant bachelor‚Äôs</a>. If you look on <a href="https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/h1b">trackitt</a>, you do see that
‚Äúmost‚Äù of the RFEs are cited based on this ‚ÄúSpecialty Occupation‚Äù
or ‚Äúlack of relevant degree‚Äù (Beneficiary qualifications I presume). I
seem like a prime suspect for atleast lack of ‚Äúbeneficiary
qualifications‚Äù. Thus, I take a 100% chance of getting an RFE.</p>

      <p>Whether the RFE gets approved or not seems to be random. There are
cases of people with Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs in Mechanical who have
made it to software job after their RFEs

post 2018. And then there are people with Master‚Äôs in Financial
Mathematics who are denied after their RFE to a CS/DS job
(<a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/Im-a-data-scientist-and-I-got-a-H1B-RFE-again-UvhDqaXm">9mineHwang</a>). A Hiring manager at Amazon sums up what a giant
cluster fuck of a mess it is: ‚ÄúOne of my report‚Äôs visa was rejected
saying the job is not a specialty occupation and doesn‚Äôt need
Bachelor‚Äôs degree which is ridiculous as why would Amazon pay that
person 300K<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> per year for a non-specialty job.  The decision on visa
application has become so arbitrary that the outcome is not known.
One employee has one application rejected and the same application was
approved the second time.‚Äù‚Äî<a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/Immigration-Mess-sAYGCXgg">hiring manager Amazon</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.fragomen.com/insights/alerts/latest-uscis-data-confirm-continued-high-rates-nonimmigrant-rfes-and-denials-fy-2019">According to
Fragoman</a>
the success of RFE approval amounts to 60.4%. So, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">41.9% x
100% x 60.4%=25.3%</code> for 1 attempt of H1B. Over three attempts the
chance becomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1-(1-25.3%)^3</code>=58%.</p>

      <p><strong>% Layoffs during a recession for H1B people</strong></p>

      <p>In 2009 it is estimated that <a href="https://cis.org/Memorandum/Estimating-Size-H1B-Population-US">650k people</a> were on H1B. Adding
<a href="https://bintlr.work/h1bProbabilityEstimate.html">230k H1B grants</a> every year, this brings the sum to a maximum of

fucking things up for H1B users in tech startups, is logged at
<a href="https://layoffs.fyi/tracker/">layoffs.fyi</a>. It is currently 60k. If we assume all layoffs to be
a factor 3 greater i.e., ~200k, we get to <em>6% layoffs</em>. And mind you
this number also has a ‚Äúportion‚Äù of Americans and GC holders and
even layoffs in other countries, and hence appears to be
conservative.</p>

people at USCIS to reject me. People with Electronics backgrounds
with such a ‚ÄúBeneficiary Qualifications‚Äù RFE, for a CS job, seem to show how each subject is related to
computer science in their rebuttal to USCIS.</p>

      <p>Despite the fact that the RFE rejections are looking random‚Äìas they even
