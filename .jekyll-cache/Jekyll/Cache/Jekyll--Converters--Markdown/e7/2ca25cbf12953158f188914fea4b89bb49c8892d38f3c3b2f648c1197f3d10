I"š<p>I want to measure my heart rate and hence judge activity based on it
say measure calories or whatever with bluetooth or what ever</p>

<p><strong>Preferably a watch that can do it or not</strong></p>

<h2 id="minimum-to-do">Minimum to do</h2>

<p>I want to be able to read out avg heartrate and currnet heart rate
during workout. Thats it and other stats if they apply.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-might-need">What you might need</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a hearrate monitor and an app</p>

    <ul>
      <li>runkeeper is at 9.99$ /month :(</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a fitbit</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>there seems to be no evidence that I can happily display avg
heart rate and heart rate at the same time while workout</p>

        <ul class="task-list">
          <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Also look at this app, it might give some hints</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a wahoo tickr or tickr X</p>

    <p><a href="https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001954110-How-do-Different-TICKR-Models-Compare-">what is different between the two</a></p>

    <p>Maybe go for X if it can really give more info about indoor biking
  and indoor running</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    * [ ] To be checked
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZBgkTm8RGQ">Good video</a> that explains the different versions. Apparently X
  has treadmill mode and indoor cycling cadence, which is like the
  RPM info!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>runkeeper is at 10$/month :(</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fitbit comes with own app but product costs a bomb</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>-wahoo app seems to be really good with the exact features I want
i.e., avg heart rate and maybe it also show current heart rate</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Download wahoo and see what all it can show</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems tha tit can show avg heartrate during a workout even on the
  app. <strong>I say buy it!</strong> this is as good as it gets with getting such information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>worst case I can return the product if it is not good</li>
</ul>

<p>order it?</p>

<h2 id="fitbit-vs-wahoo">Fitbit vs Wahoo</h2>

<p>At this point Wahoo which needs an external bluetooth device to show
its working and stats, where with a fitbit doesnâ€™t and it is not clear
if it can display the relavant stats. If it can, it is going to be
quite pricy (200 Euros). Instead I could just get a new phone for that
price. Even if I pay so much I donâ€™t know if it can show what I want!</p>

<p>So the thing is pretty clear that wahoo tickr/tickrX should be
enough. But which one of those should I buy?</p>

<p>Cadence seems like it is going to be pointless as my training involves
varying grades of levels while biking. As long as I am in a varying
training program like in the treadmill or on the</p>

<p>double tap feature?</p>

<p>Bought it! Its just 30 bucks, let me get it, period?</p>
