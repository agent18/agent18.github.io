<p>I am in my prime (26-30) and I think I can work more and as a result
gain more out of prime than I have. Management Consulting seems to be
capable of doing just that.</p>

<p>Earlier <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-quiz/#/quantitative=yes&amp;verbalAndSocial=yes&amp;riskTolerance=no&amp;challengeTolerance=yes&amp;careerStage=early&amp;pathType=directImpact%252C+advocacy%252C+earningToGive%252C+research">80k hours suggests</a> had rated ‘management consulting’ for me as
the best option. Not sure why it removed it from the recommendations.</p>

<p>I like the idea of consulting and the associated hype of earning a lot
with the possibility of earning in lower millions if I work at the best
firms. It seems fast-paced and I am not fully sure if I can stand to
its tests of working a lot, but I suspect that I can.</p>

<p>It requires long hours of work and  will require &gt;60 hrs per week for
the next few years.</p>

<h2 id="diving-into-the-details">Diving into the details</h2>

<p>Skills obtainable: problem-solving, presentation, analytics</p>

<p>Connections: Not sure, but should be good.</p>

<p>Credentials: Success appears to be tangible just like in DS, i.e., it
should be possible to explain to future employers why I am good.</p>

<p>Runway: Doesn’t seem to be a problem, as this is possibly one of the
highest paid jobs. But paying for an MBA would burn a lot of my
current runway.</p>

<h2 id="known-paths">Known paths</h2>

<p>At the start you join somehow (after a masters/other ways). TBD!</p>

<p>Work in consulting for a 2-3 years and then most people usually:</p>

<ul>
  <li>go for an MBA</li>
  <li>work in the industry you served as a consultant</li>
  <li>venture capital</li>
  <li>private/equity</li>
  <li>policy /civil service</li>
  <li>work in the strategy team in a company</li>
</ul>

<p>After an MBA ? TBD</p>

<h3 id="do-we-need-an-mba-to-succeed">Do we need an MBA to “succeed”?</h3>

<p>MBA’s are pricy as of education as well as having to give up work for
2 years while studying. And executive MBA seems to be quite long. Even
If I start now I would be able to finish it only when I am 31.</p>

<p><strong>Can I start my executive MBA at 31? Can I do an actual MBA at 31?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/people.aspx">Rob Mather</a> the founder of AMF has an MBA, does amazing things</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>to get to senior positions within companies you don’t really need an
MBA - 80k hours</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjonathangoldberg/">David goldberg</a>, the CEO of founders pledge has an MPhil in
philosophy. His career is really interesting as he done quite some
founding, being in top positions (General manager, Co-founder), and
all this without an MBA.</p>

accomplishments, all with a masters degree in philosophy and without
an MBA.</p>

  <p>I manage the team, and have especially focused on product design,
strategy, fund-raising, writing our content and hiring. - Benjamin
Todd</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Sundar Pichai,  Tim Cook and Satya Nadella all have MBA’s</p>

<p>To me the need for an MBA to found companies or lead them or to be able
to killer-problem-solve seems not really necessary as there are others
who have succeeded without it.</p>

<h2 id="strong-indications">Strong indications</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We think it suits someone with a well-rounded profile of good
analytical skills, social skills, teamwork, and the ability to work
hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think I am suited for it because…</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don’t know if I suited</li>
  <li>I think I am not fast, if I am fast I might make mistakes with
numbers?</li>
  <li>Not sure how to rate my analytical ability</li>
  <li>I am not quick with numbers, prefer a calculator as soon as I am
dealing with 1000’s</li>
</ul>

<p>However the analytical shit that I want to be good at can be gained as
a skill, over time. I could spend the next few months if required
prepping the fuck for this.</p>

<p>I suspect I should do some form of statistics and that I should start
right away.</p>

<p>In which case it is better to take up something similar like and
internship and see how I fare.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-am-unsure-of">Things I am unsure of</h2>

<p>How much will <strong>I</strong> get paid at start, after MBA, and is it easy to
earn in the lower millions?</p>

<p>Do companies sponsor doing an MBA?</p>

<p>Is doing the MBA same everywhere?</p>

<p>what about MBA in part-time?</p>

<p>What type of skills or credentials does it give?</p>

<p>What are known paths after clocking a few years in as a management consultant?</p>

<p>How to get into Big 3 without doing a master?</p>

<p>MBA allows to learn about other sectors like finance etc…?</p>

<p>What is the career path, at start, midway and end?</p>

<p>P.S</p>

<p>1.2 hrs of work continuously and then had to break until later in the
night when I was procrastinating and just “finished the essay”
(0.5hrs).</p>

<p>Researching in itself can hold me to keep continuing. I was wondering
how I would determine if MBA is needed or not. I saw that today I
spent &gt;1 hr straight up without flinching doing my work. It’s when I
see the time that I want to take a break and everything goes downhill
from there on. And when I just wanted to write something and sleep, I
started going deeper into reading about something and making some
notes. ‘Researching’ and attempting to solve problems in itself could
be its end.</p>

<p>The first 10 words and the topic are probably the <strong>hardest</strong> parts of
this life. Peace</p>
