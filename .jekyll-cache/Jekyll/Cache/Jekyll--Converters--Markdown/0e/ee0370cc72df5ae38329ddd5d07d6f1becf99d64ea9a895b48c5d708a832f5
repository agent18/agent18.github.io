<p>Mr. Agent,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have defaulted yesterday! Can you please send me your PayPal? I
owe you some money</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs great news, because it means you didn‚Äôt default on the previous
11 days. Nice job!</p>

<p>Good news for me too: paypal.me/PradeepKumarS</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the next 30 days (just the beginning), I will do 1 hr atleast of
DP similar to the work done in the last ‚Äúmission‚Äù, i.e., look at
something that I need to really understand, and split it into
phrases and provide examples for each (also identify where exactly I
am failing). I have recently found a gold mine to dig into
(#statistics, poissons distributions and the like‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs going to
be amazing)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. Find stuff that you need to understand but are confused or
intimidated by and break down the claims as mentioned later below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P&amp;E</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>On one hand, the (presence)[9a] (of reaction forces)[9]
(acting)[10] in the (direction of the constraint)[10a]
(generally)[10c] (renders)[10b] the (equilibrium)[11] description
(more complex)[12]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For 9, we imagine the Tension force in a pendulum.</p>

  <p>For 9a, we imagine pulling on the pendulum so that there is no slack
in the string, which is when the Tension in the string appears.</p>

  <p>For 10a, for a pendulum in the mean position, we can imagine that
the pendulum will not go down even if 100kN of force is applied. It
will stay at L (assuming the string can handle the stress and does
not deform beyond L). This downward direction is the direction of
the constraint. However, if you pull in the horizontal plane, it
will move, i.e., the resistance to motion is along the string.</p>

  <p>For 10, we think about the direction of Tension force (vertical)
being the same as the direction of constraint (vertical)</p>

  <p>For 10b, I don‚Äôt know what example to give! Need help! Do I need to
give an example?</p>

  <p>For 10c, I don‚Äôt know what example to give! Need help!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mission is to identify and test the claim, not necessarily to give
an isolated example for each phrase. The statement is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On one hand, the presence of reaction forces acting in the direction
of the constraint generally renders the equilibrium description more
complex, since those unknown forces must be determined along the
entire trajectory such that kinematical constraints are satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would break it up into three parts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On one hand, (the presence of reaction forces acting in the
direction of the constraint)[1] generally renders the (equilibrium
description)[2] (more complex)[3], since (those unknown forces must
be determined along the entire trajectory such that kinematical
constraints are satisfied)[4].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs saying that [1] makes [2] to be [3] because of [4].</p>

<p>To test the claim, we need to take an example for [1] and look at its
‚Äúequilibrium description‚Äù [2]. If the equilibrium description that we
see is ‚Äúmore complex‚Äù [3] and if it is so precisely because of [4],
then the claim is supported by the example. If not, the claim is
false.</p>

<p>Note that you can work with longer phrases like [1] and [4] once you
have given individual examples for the inner phrases like ‚Äúreaction
forces‚Äù or ‚Äúdirection of the constraint‚Äù. For someone new to cricket,
you have to give an example for ‚Äúcover drive‚Äù to back up the claim
that a ‚Äúcover drive‚Äù will hit the ball in the cover region. But for an
experienced person, you can work with the longer phrase ‚Äúa cover drive
is a bad idea against a swinging good-length ball when the team is
already three wickets down on the first day of the test match‚Äù. Why?
Because he can immediately come up with an example of Kohli getting
out against England at Lords or whatever. He can easily test that
scenario against the claim that such a cover drive is a bad idea. The
newbie cricketer won‚Äôt have an example of a cover drive, let alone a
good-length ball or three wickets down or test match.</p>

<p>So, this will allow you to cover more sentences since you will have to
come up with fewer examples per sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P&amp;E</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>If you want to (increase)[1] your (social impact)[2], you face a
choice: try to (make a difference right away)[4], or (invest in

</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>For 2, we think of $$‚Äôs donated to AMF</p>

  <p>For 1, we imagine what I am doing right now (saving 1 life per year
with 4k$). Instead if I was somehow worthy of working at GiveWell I
could save 24 lives per year (97k/4k</p>

  <p>/life) as a conservative estimate.</p>

  <p>For 4, I imagine living in a house 300 euros cheaper than my current
one, I don‚Äôt eat outside, I don‚Äôt go to India, I save as much money
as I can (in my current case, that would amount to 8-10k donations).</p>

  <p>For 5, I imagine clocking 4 hrs a day on DP for Data Science and
becoming worthy of Google placement in US which possibly would earn
200k$;</p>

  <p>For 6, we imagine donating &gt;35% of 200k per year after 5 years which
is much greater than 8k</p>

  <p>For 7, we imagine donating this 35% until I retire from there.</p>

  <p>For 8, we imagine donating 35% of 200k&gt;8k</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>If you want [1] and [2], you face a choice, such as [4] or [5]

  <p>When we want to increase the $$ donated, we need to choose if we
want to donate all we can now (8k$) or be very good in Data Science
that will place you in Google for a salary of 200k.</p>

  <p>Is the above way of writing an example of the claim, do you expect
to see [1], [2], [3], [4] in the example as well?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was better done than the technical sentences above. If this is
the first time you‚Äôre looking at ‚Äúgreater impact‚Äù or ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù, you
can give an individual example for them. Otherwise, you can work with
the phrase ‚Äúinvest in yourself to make a greater impact in the
long-term‚Äù and test his claims using your example for that
phrase. Note that he hasn‚Äôt made a claim yet. He‚Äôs just asked a
question: which is best? So, you have to keep both examples with you
and work through whatever he says next.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spent way too much time pondering about what example to give here,
my confusion being how do you give an example to test ‚ÄúSomething is
interesting BECAUSE they are the exception‚Äù! I am aware that we can
test, ‚ÄúSomething is interesting AND it is also the exception‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>That‚Äôs a great observation.</em> Something for later! The current skill is
concrete thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P&amp;E</p>

  <p>(Most people)[1] reach the (peak of their impact)[2] in their
(middle age)[3]. (Income)[4b] usually (peaks)[4c] in the 40s)[4],
suggesting that it takes around 20 years for (most people)[5a] to
reach their (peak productivity)[5]. Similarly, (experts)[6] only
(reach their peak abilities)[7] between (age 30 to 60)[8], and if
anything, (this age)[9a] is (increasing over time)[9].</p>

  <p>For 1 &amp; 5a, we think of Management Consultants(MC‚Äôs) who stay till
they become partner at top firms, we think of Theoretical
Physicists, Novel writers, Politicians (US President)</p>

  <p>For 2 &amp; 4b: It takes upto 20 years of working before reaching the
scale of Senior Partner which makes bonuses in the order of millions
(source). Donating 50% of that would be the peak of impact.</p>

  <p>For 3 &amp; 4: Graduation age of a Master is ~25, 20 years from there
seems to be 40-45 (middle age)</p>

  <p>For 5, we imagine becoming a senior partner at the top 3 firms</p>

  <p>For 6, Scientists and economists</p>

  <p>For 7, we think of people who win the Nobel Prize</p>

  <p>For 8, Nobel prize winners have an average age of 47 (Source)</p>

  <p>For 9, The average age of Nobel prize winners has increased by 6
years between the 20th and 21st century (source: TIO chapter 10).</p>

  <p>For 9a: The average age of Nobel prize winners (47)</p>

  <p>Claims</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Most people reach [2] in middle age [3] ; 4b usually peaks in

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

Physicists, Novel writers, Politicians (US President)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But is that really a test of the claim? If you look at most
politicians and measure when they reached the ‚Äúpeak of their impact‚Äù,
it might be in their old age. All the top politicians here and there
seem to be around retirement age. How is the claim supported? In fact,
can you think of people who reach their peak in middle age and either
stay constant (without rising further) or go down?</p>

<p>In other words, the aim is not to get examples and nod along with the
author saying that, yes, it makes sense. The aim is to do an
independent test. He claims, as you pointed out, that most people
reach [2] in [3]. The implicit question in the claim is ‚Äúwhen do most
people reach [2]?‚Äù And his claim is that the answer is [3]. To test
that, you need to independently look at these ‚Äúmost people‚Äù and check
when they reach [2]. After you‚Äôve got your answer, compare it to
[3]. That way you can actually find out when he is wrong (as he might
be above).</p>

<p><em>Skip the 9 examples if they are pretty obvious. In reality, you will
go this deep only on the key phrases in some article or book. Focus on
testing the claim independently.</em></p>

  <p>For 1, I imagine, K. Anders Ericsson and Martin Seligman</p>

  <p>For 2, I imagine the ‚Äúexploratory data analysis‚Äù I did for a course
on the ‚Äúenergy usage over a 2-day period in February 2007‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stay with the running example whenever possible. You can imagine
Ericsson studying the diaries of the violin players.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 3, data that average Nobel Laureates age was 47.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The top violin players had been playing for around 7.5k hours over
nearly a decade or so.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 4, ability to win the Olympic gold medal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They went on to the top orchestras.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 5a, we look at the millions of videos on youtube on each aspect
of figure skating like, two foot spin, crossovers etc‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Violin-playing is enough of an example to show ‚Äúestablished field‚Äù. No
need to go into new examples. Conserve your concreteness! Lots of
claims to test.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 5, Figure skating</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ditto.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 6, we look at Shizuka Arakawa who started at the age of 5 and
won the Olympic medal for Figure Skating at 24. Roughly 20 years
later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does violin-playing <strong>require</strong> 10-30 years of focused practice? Well,
we saw in TiO that it seemed to require on the order of 10k hours
across many fields, including violin-playing - so that‚Äôs fine.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong> ‚Ä¶ you should have second thoughts about that 30 years
figure. 30 years of focused practice?! Name one example where that was
even found, let alone absolutely necessary. From where did he pull out
this number?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 7, we imagine her persistence despite the ~20000 times she had
derriere impacts on unforgiving ice while practicing her Ina Bauer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Staying with the running example, we can think of the violin-players
playing by themselves, not with others, fixing their mistakes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claims</p>

  <p>[4] in [5a,5], requires 10-30 years of [7]</p>

  <p>To get Olympic gold medal, in figure skating, Shizuka Arakawa spent
20 years from a young age of 5. She fell on her ass atleast 20000
times while practicing her specialty jump and managed to keep going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, is that 20 years of focused practice throughout? Was she
practicing as long and as intensely at 5 as at 25?</p>

<p>Second of all, was it <strong>necessary</strong>? To test that, we would have to
check if there was anybody who got in with less than 10 years. For
example, Bobby Fischer became a grand master with 9 years (TiO). On
the face of it, that‚Äôs falsifies the claim that it requires 10
years. <em>(We will usually give them the benefit of the doubt, of
course.)</em> ???</p>

</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>For 8a: if we Google search ‚Äú10000 hours skill practice‚Äù, on 3/4
hits of popular news outlets like BBC, you will find Anders Ericsson

</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs great that you came up with some empirical evidence, but it is
not necessary for our purposes of concrete thinking. Have we heard of
him described as the father of deliberate practice and being quoted
heavily in a book about deliberate practice? Cool. Moving on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 8: field answering how Shizuka Arakawa won the Olympic Medal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The field of research is ‚Äúexpert performance‚Äù. ??? but that‚Äôs
vague init?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this not an example? What should it be then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The claim is that Ericsson is the leader of the field of research. He
is, so we move on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 9, Anders has been publishing papers from 1990 until now (2019)
on the topic related to ‚Äúexpertise in skills‚Äù (40 years).</p>

  <p>For 11, Jerry Rice is one of the ‚Äúgreatest receivers‚Äù in NFL
history. He has played 22 seasons and every game in every season
except in 1997. No one has done this ever at the ‚Äúreceiver
position‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems like an irrelevant example. How does it test the claim?</p>

<p>The claim is that Ericsson has never found a convincing case. So, an
independent test of that claim would be to look at all the cases of
extraordinary abilities and see if there is even a single one without
extended practice. Yes, it‚Äôs a lot of work, but that‚Äôs what it would
take to test a claim like ‚Äúnever found a convincing case‚Äù. Still, we
can point to some study of music or chess that looks at all the cases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 12, ‚ÄúHis off season training‚Äôs were done 6 days a week. His
workouts were known as the most demanding in the league, which other
players would get sick before the end of the day. His trainer
wouldn‚Äôt reveal the workouts because the trainer was afraid that
people could injure themselves trying to duplicate it.‚Äù Source: TIO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this one case doesn‚Äôt test the claim about all the cases. For
example, Jerry Rice may have done all this, but if there was even one
guy who made it big without extended practice, that would falsify the
claim.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 10, In the 1985 draft, fifteen teams passed him over before the
San Francisco 49ers finally signed him, indicating that he was never
going to be a legend. But he did become a legend, seemingly because
of [12]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ditto. Given that you are familiar with ‚Äúextraordinary abilities‚Äù and
‚Äúextended practice‚Äù, you don‚Äôt need isolated examples for them. Just
focus on testing the claim.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not a test of the claim.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(All this)[1a] (may sound like a bit of a downer)[2]: being

  <p>Does it need an example, if so what is it? how do you give an

</blockquote>

<p>The claim is that ‚Äúyou can improve‚Äù is the flip side of the downer
that ‚Äúbeing successful takes time‚Äù. If you put in the time, you can
improve, which is an encouraging message compared to the previous
discouraging message. So, yes, it is a flip side.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am finding it hard to find one running example and split it among
1 to 6, am I expected to do that? Is it a requirement? In the claims
I understand that it would all need to be from the same example.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Focus on testing the claim rather than on whether it is a good

</blockquote>

<p>Good job on testing a claim with an example, but that‚Äôs not the claim!
The claim is that <em>you can improve with focused practice</em>. Do you have
an example of him doing focused practice? If so, focus on that.</p>

<p><em>Basically, it should be an independent test.</em> The claim is that
anybody can improve at a skill with focused practice. So, the
independent test would be to see someone do focused practice for a
while and measure their skill before and after. Then, see if that
actually matches the claim that they will improve (maybe focused
practice would decrease their skill - who knows?).</p>

<p>It may seem kind of silly to test such an obviously correct claim. But
what if it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfocused practice‚Äù that does the trick but rather
time spent doing something? (I hope you just thought of TiO talking
about X-ray experts who weren‚Äôt better than novices to support the
claim that mere experience is not enough. Or ordinary golfers who just
hit balls.) Without a concrete test, we wouldn‚Äôt really know.</p>

<p>To drive home the point, <em>what do I mean by an independent test</em> of a
claim? It‚Äôs like removing their proposed answer from the claim and
filling the blank yourself. ‚ÄúMost people reach their peak in their
middle age‚Äù becomes ‚Äúmost people reach their peak in <em>__</em>‚Äù. Now, you
go look at most people and check when they reach their peak and you
fill in the blank yourself. Then, you compare the two answers. If they
don‚Äôt match, either the claim is wrong or your example or reasoning is
faulty. Either way you get the valuable information that something is
amiss. Otherwise, if you just read it as ‚Äúmost people reach their peak
in middle age‚Äù, you won‚Äôt notice if something is wrong.</p>

<p>No need to give these diverse examples. Take one relevant running
example and stick to it. Here, for this 80k hours post, the relevant
skill we care about is not guitar-playing but something like AI
research or quant trading.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>For 23 &amp; 24,</p>

  <p>‚ÄúJamie Dimon was an amazingly accomplished financial services
executive at age twenty-nine, but he was much better at fifty, as
CEO of JPMorgan Chase[21,22]‚Äù- (TIO pg179)</p>

  <p>What is this ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù you ask? I couldn‚Äôt think of other
examples, than from the TIO</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem here is that you‚Äôre not doing an independent test of the
claim. You‚Äôre letting TiO come up with the example (Jamie Dimon), the
claim question (how was Jamie at 50 compared to 29) and you‚Äôre letting
him fill in the blank (oh, he was much better). How are you
independently testing it?</p>

<p>He‚Äôs allowed to come up with the claim question and maybe the example,
but you have to fill in the blank. At 29, maybe Jamie took the company
to 12% growth rate (if that‚Äôs what you care about) and, at 50, 18%
growth rate. Based on that, you decide that, yes, he was better. That
matches the claimed answer, so you accept the claim for now. If,
instead, Jamie took it to 9% growth rate, you would fill the answer as
‚Äúworse than before‚Äù and reject the claim. Similarly, if it went from
12% to 12.5%, you would fill in the blank as ‚Äúslightly better‚Äù and
reject the claim because it said it was ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù.</p>

<p>Can you see the different scenarios in which you will reject a claim?
If you just went ahead without an example and without an independent
test, you would just accept claims as they come (or get confused).</p>

<p>What examples could you have come up with for improving over decades?
Sachin. Rahman. Dhoni. Mani Ratnam? Superstar? Harris Jayaraj?! Note
that a counter-example doesn‚Äôt falsify the claim because it says you
can improve, not you will improve over decades. So, you just need one
valid example.</p>

<p>Again, not a very useful example because, in this article, we care
about skills that relate to EA.</p>

<p>Overall, focus on testing the claims. Avoid giving individual examples
for known phrases.</p>

<p>Great job on pointing out where you got confused.</p>

<p>The mission specifically said ‚ÄúIf the author provides a running
example, hold on to it for dear life and use it throughout that
section or chapter.‚Äù That did not happen. You switched from one
example to another.</p>

<hr />

<p>Time taken: 2h. 200 phrases reviewed @ 1.66 phrases per minute.</p>

<p>Mission #8: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to

example for the question, fill-in-the-blank for the answer yourself,
and compare to the claimed answer.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Until you can fill in the blank yourself, you don‚Äôt really
