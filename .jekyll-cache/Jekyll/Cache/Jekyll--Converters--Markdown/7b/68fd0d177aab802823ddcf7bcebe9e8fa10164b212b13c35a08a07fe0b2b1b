I"" <h2 id="should-we-write">Should we write?</h2>

<p>It has been quite a few useless weeks, doesn’t matter why (or does
it?). Moving on, I want to get my shit together for the n’th time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html">PG claims</a> that writing generates ideas. It makes sense to write.
But I don’t write at my daily 9-5 job. I usually have a small problem
to solve at a time, so I make drawings to think, and then present the
stuff in a powerpoint. I suspect the problem I am trying to solve
right now, with figuring out my career, is a hard one. It is
convoluted, it is large with several subdivisions. It is completely
different from work. In the current case of determining what is the
action I should take for my career, I suspect it needs some decent
writing (thinking and generating ideas). It is research.</p>

<p>So, I should write, and preferably use as much time as possible in my
life doing it. Theoretically I should be writing at least 2 hrs a day
and much much more on weekends. But… Youtube, chess, and general
procrastination techniques are have taken precedence.</p>

<p>The only reason I came to the computer despite feeling so sleepy yesterday was
all the guilt building up amongst other things(what will an STM think
about me? What will the cousin who I promised to show my research
think about me, when I have nothing to show?)</p>

<p>I need to work as I am running out of time. I have spent around 6 months
without any impacting results. I am 26. Let’s go!</p>

<h1 id="how-to-motivate-your-self-to-write-properly">How to motivate your self to write properly</h1>

<p>The equation of motivation is simple,</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ Motivation = Challenge-skill balance * value of feedback/delay
in feedback
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>Typical work at home looks like this: I set a goal of writing 1k words
per hour (to keep me challenged). My feedback parameters are the
number of words I write per hour, based on the goal. There is usually
no closure. At the end of the essay I just run away from the keyboard
and do other things. Next day I do the same thing, without much heed
to continuation. On Fridays, I try to combine all the words I have
written so far into a post. After several hours of procrastination on
that Friday I make up my mind that this is too much and that I have to
sleep, and publish what ever I have and go to sleep.</p>

<p>Usually I feel guilty that I didn’t work the last week and make
agreements to pay money to a friend, in case I don’t deliver. This I
do in an attempt to increase the value of feedback. Off-late I haven’t
been doing that.</p>

<p>During times that I feel hopeful about myself and don’t make any
agreements and allow for the inner Thej to rise to the moment, I
mostly fail due to the resistance I face because of having to clock 2
hrs of god forsaken work. It appears by the way I talk that its not
really motivating to write and solve problems of this nature.</p>

<p>No one is reading anyway?</p>

<p><strong>Challenge-skill balance</strong></p>

<p>Setting a goal of 1kwords/hr seems to be overchalenging me. I usually
need to read, and can’t predict in advance how much reading needs to
be done. I find this happening often. To meet the challenge, sometimes
I stick to ranting (mostly useless), other times I say, “well, I
tried” and just give up.</p>

<p>But wait! At work I don’t write 1000 words in a powerpoint or a word
document, I just DO (solve the problem)! I work to get things done
(closure perhaps!). The fact that something needs me to rack my brain
for answers make it challenging enough I think. Of course this has to
be within my skill level. And most times it is otherwise I
get to ask help.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the goal is not to write a million words, the goal is to think with the help
of writing - me to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How about reducing the goal to 500 words (a more reasonable one)?</p>

<p>As I was saying above, I don’t think I can place well a goal of
words/hour as I am doing research. I need something to keep me
challenged and also something that improves the quality of the
content.</p>

<p>How about writing a publishable post of publishable quality every
day. A post with the 3 R’s (read, reflect and re-write). Of course we
don’t have a lot of time. Lets say 300-500 words post. I could spend
roughly 2 hrs doing it or I could spend more as I feel (for now). Take a small
topic or write a continuation of the a previous topic.</p>

<p><strong>Value and delay of feedback</strong></p>

<p>I don’t think there is any closure in the way I usually perform
tasks. Except on Friday, when at 4 am in the morning I just say “fuck
this” and publish what ever I have written.</p>

<p>I have to do both reading and writing and don’t have a proper system
to inform me about my progress at every instant. Finding parameters
that combine both the tasks seems hard or not efficient/effective.
Measuring number of words read is not so easy to do.</p>

<p>When I do a 1 publishable post a day, I suspect that I get
closure. The power of closure seems to be strongly underestimated. I
have never worked more than 2 hrs in my life ever on a fucking weekday
(other than Friday), WILLINGLY. Today I stand before you suspecting
that I might go as far as 3 hrs to finish this godforsaken post I have
started.</p>

<p>With the 1 publishable post per day, I have some feedback parameters
(possibly still vague). I aim to write the whole thing in 2 hrs. This
would mean that I should probably have written the first draft in 45
mins and then started re-writing after keeping in mind that I have a
deadline and also that I need to sleep soon. This is also something I
do at work. I constantly look at the time (deadline), and keep
hurrying to finish a task. I have some idea how much time each part of
the task takes. Agreed, its not concrete, but there are no rock-solid
parameters in my job as well, and I seem to be just fine. And
sometimes, on a good day, you want to go deeper into the topic. Well,
if things are going well I don’t mind staying up to do better. That
will be a good day for writing.</p>

<p><em>But no one is reading anyway</em> Well maybe we can change that?</p>

<p>Sometimes I make agreements with friends for money that I would finish
the task by “this” time, thereby inherently increasing the value of a
task. In the end that is the only thing that has kept me writing
“continuously”. I will commit to writing this week 1 post a day, every day
(except Friday t/m Sunday).</p>

<p>As a by product of the <strong>1 publishable post per day</strong> week, we improve
the quality of life on Fridays by not piling up all the work on
Friday. We also improve the quality of essay by removing the
“deleting-words-phobia”. We will finally have the power to delete
sentences in peace.</p>

  <p>Cut ~out~ everything unnecessary</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="time-management-for-motivation">Time management for motivation</h2>

<p>Time is limited and spending it on 0.5 hr breaks for every hour of
work is a lot. I would like to keep my breaks till the end after I
have completed the work for the day. I propose not using cell phones,
YouTube and chess during the time of writing, unless urgent.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>It appears to be a good plan to write one publishable post a day, ~300
to 500 words in ~2hrs. I will refine the time part of the essay over
the week. the “1 publishable post per day” week might seems to improve
the quality of life and the quality of the essay.</p>

<p>As a last straw of making this work I propose to keep away from all
distraction from during the time I start till I end.</p>

<p>Making a commitment to write everyday seems to be the one thing in the
past that worked to get me to do work at home “continuously”. I guess
it would be stupid to not do it (for now).</p>

<p>P.S</p>

<p>This essay took ~3 hrs to write despite excluding the spent hr
yesterday. 1 hr, followed by 0.5 hr break, followed by 2 hrs straight
writing till closure.</p>
