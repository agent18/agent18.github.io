<p>Machi,</p>

<p>Great job on calculating the lifetime values for the different
scenarios. Nice to see that you’ve consistently put in 4 hours per
day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a few years I can “build the skills” through DP hopefully and see where that gets me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the weakest link in the chain. You’re not clear about what “build the skills” means.</p>

<p>If you’re serious about this, you need to follow what the successful
people here have done. Don’t spend your time doing “DP hopefully and
see where that gets me”. Offer your services as an unpaid intern or
assistant to the people who are already in the loop. That way, they
will get some benefit from you and in turn you will find out what kind
of skills you actually need to learn. Ask people directly what steps
you need to take to be “GiveWell researcher material”. Application
rejections don’t give as much detailed feedback.</p>

<p>Another weakness in the analysis is that the first two paths involve
concrete dollar figures whereas the latter two paths involve estimated
impacts.</p>

<p>Overall, the statement from my previous email stands. Recommend
focusing on getting a data science job before “DP, blog, skills,
etc.”. Still, I could of course be wrong about this. I leave it up to
you. Good luck.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210301000000*/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting">this</a> post on OpenPhil’s site regarding their 2018 research
analyst role they say the following:</p>

<p><strong>What can someone do now to become a stronger fit for future Open
Philanthropy generalist RA openings</strong></p>

<p>Below are some personal ideas, which might or might not be worth the
required time investment if you might be interested in a generalist
RA-like role at Open Philanthropy in the future, and which are not
necessarily endorsed by everyone on the RA hiring committee. In no
particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Practice writing explanations of your thinking on complicated
topics, and aim for strong clarity, succinctness, and <a href="/reasoning-transparency">reasoning
transparency</a>. Post these explanations to the web if you can,
so that you can get feedback from readers.</li>
  <li>Familiarize yourself with basic concepts in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">cost-benefit
analysis</a> and <a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/">effective altruism</a>.</li>
  <li>Learn how to critically evaluate published evidence. E.g. see
these GiveWell blog posts: <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2012/08/17/our-principles-for-assessing-evidence/">Our principles for assessing
evidence</a>, <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2012/08/23/how-we-evaluate-a-study/">How we evaluate a study</a>, and <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2012/09/06/surveying-the-research-on-a-topic/">Surveying the

  <li>Be familiar with the basics of descriptive and inferential
statistics, Bayesian reasoning, and microeconomics (supply and
demand, comparative advantage, elasticity, marginal thinking,
value of information, etc.).</li>
  <li>Practice making <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PsEppdvgRisz5xAHG/fermi-estimates">Fermi estimates</a>.</li>
  <li>Do <a href="/blog/efforts-improve-accuracy-our-judgments-and-forecasts#Calibration_training">calibration training</a>, both with trivia questions (e.g. see

<h3 id="the-role">The role</h3>

<p>Senior Researchers at GiveWell are the intellectual leaders who guide
our exploration of how we can do the most good. In this role, you will
be responsible for finding, researching, and ultimately recommending
high-impact or potentially high-impact giving opportunities. As part
of a small team, you will be a significant contributor to our
decisions about how hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent with
the goal of saving and improving the lives of people living in the
lowest-income communities in the world.</p>

<p>You will be a leader on our research team, conducting research to help
us identify outstanding programs to recommend. Examples of questions
Senior Researchers have worked on recently include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/bridges-to-prosperity">What is the impact of building footbridges in rural
communities?</a></li>
  <li>What should we believe about the impacts of improved water quality
on all-cause mortality?</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://blog.givewell.org/2018/05/04/new-research-on-cash-transfers/">How can we model the general equilibrium effects of cash
transfers?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the core work of identifying outstanding programs,
Senior Researchers own messy and complicated questions that inform our
analysis, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models">How can we improve our approach to cost-effectiveness
modeling?</a></li>
  <li>How should we use pooled impact estimates from a highly
heterogeneous evidence base?</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://blog.givewell.org/2019/12/02/new-research-on-moral-weights/">How should we prioritize programs that reduce poverty relative to
programs that reduce deaths? What is the moral value of each
outcome?</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://blog.givewell.org/2018/02/13/revisiting-leverage/">How should we think about the opportunity cost of other actors’
contributions to programs we fund?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Our Senior Researchers leverage a combination of critical research
review and synthesis, empirical analysis, modeling, logical reasoning,
and good judgment in order to make practical recommendations on a
topic.</p>

<h3 id="about-you"><strong>About you</strong></h3>

<p>Senior Researchers typically have a quantitatively oriented advanced
degree and/or substantive relevant experience. They also have the
intellectual flexibility to tackle a wide range of questions such as
those listed above.</p>

<p>We expect you will be characterized by many of the below qualities. We
encourage you to apply if you would use the majority of these
characteristics to describe yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are passionate about helping improve global health and
alleviate global poverty as much as possible.</li>
  <li>You are highly skilled at critically analyzing and synthesizing
empirical research and understanding how a body of evidence may
apply to real-world problems.</li>
  <li>You are able to plan an efficient approach to exploring
complicated questions, including identifying and focusing on the
most decision-relevant aspects of a project.</li>
  <li>You consider the big picture, asking questions like: is this
project appropriately formulated and the best use of my time? What
is GiveWell getting wrong in our research?</li>
  <li>You clearly communicate what you believe and why, as well as what
you are uncertain about.</li>
  <li>You ask a lot of questions, and are curious, rather than
defensive, when interrogating your own or others’ work.</li>
  <li>You are able to execute research that holds up under scrutiny from
others and over time.</li>
  <li>You are respectful, effective, and efficient in your interactions
with colleagues as well as external parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>Confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. Here’s
a secret: there’s no such thing as a “perfect” candidate. GiveWell is
looking for exceptional people who want to make a positive impact
through their work and help create an organization where everyone can
thrive. So whatever background you bring with you, please apply if
this role would make you excited to come to work every day.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something high-impact you can do part-time, I think often the strongest option is to help run a local EA group.
I’ve added a mini write-up of this path on our careers list:
https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/#run-a-local-group
Many people are also not aware that there are now tens of paid
full-time positions running these groups, so it’s rapidly turning into
a full career path. More info in the write up.</p>
