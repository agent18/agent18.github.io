## First impressions
[Which career path allows you to earn the most?
#Investment-Banking!](https://80000hours.org/2013/06/where-can-i-earn-the-most/)

Lot of money involved. Every case study in 80k hours typically claims to
be able to give ~1mn$ after 3 years in work. Long hours of work (90+
hours), i.e., ~13 hours a day.

Looking at what the job involves on Quora, there is so much negativity
ending on "but the money is great".  Causing me to maybe consider
backing off a bit. There seem to be many divisions one can work in
within investment banking, which have possibly different levels of
intellectual stimulation and money involved. 


## What the fuck is Investment Banking?

Is it different from trading?

## Diving into the details

Skills: Analytical skills?

Credentials: You should probably have earned others a lot of money,
should serve as credentials.

Connections: Apparently you will know a lot of people in your life
time who are CEO's and CFO's. Many of your colleagues would be working
in other companies once they exit, . There are specific jobs reserved
for investment banking type of people within industry

Runway: Possibly the best runway possible

	Cons: Long hours, 80-90hrs?

## Entry route for me

1. MBA 
MBA seems to be a good platform to get into investment banking.


Examples?

what if I just stay in the Netherlands?

### MBA needed?



## Exit route?

## how the exit route is in the direction of what you want to do?
