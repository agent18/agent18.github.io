<p><strong>What is EU blue card?</strong></p>

<p>Something that allows you to accumalate time while working in
different member states, so that in the end you can get a
PR/Citizenship.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The blue card is an approved EU-wide resident permit allowing high
talented non-EU residents to work and live in any nation within the
European Union, barring Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom,
which are not subject to the proposal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One can work in the EU. But, while moving from one member state to the
other, <a href="https://ind.nl/en/work/Pages/EU-blue-card-holder.aspx">one has to pay money and apply for an RP costing 909 Euros,
	for example, in the Netherland</a>, in order to work here. One does
not need to be in Europe to apply for the blue card.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.eu-bluecard.com/highly-qualified-workers/">Blue Card for non EU peeps</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unemployment for highly-qualified workers may not last longer than 3 consecutive months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This PERMIT  seems to be not for simple people who finished a degree and
looking to start their career. This is for the real deal, people with
good amount of experience.</p>

<p><strong>Important requirements</strong></p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Non-EU citizenship</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Educated or professionally experienced</li>

  </li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Earn a minimum of 4.908 euros gross per month for Netherlands
    in the contract - <a href="https://www.iamexpat.nl/career/employment-news/eu-blue-card-skilled-migrants-your-questions-answered">iamexpat</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Should be possible with enough experience.</p>

<p><strong>Who issues the EU blue card</strong></p>

<p>The immigration services of the country in which the employment and residence will be taken up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EU Blue Card law dictates European immigration services to issue the
Blue Card work and residence permit within three months. This is
considerably faster than most local alternatives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we get the Blue card in 3 months, once an empoyee chooses us, and
sponsors the blue card.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apply.eu/Questions/">FAQ EU BLUE CARD</a></p>

<p><strong>When do you loose your Blue card?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EU Blue Card holders are allowed to go back to their home countries
or other non-EU states for a maximum of 12 consecutive months without
losing the EU Blue Card ownership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EU blue card to PR to Citizenship</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. You must work for 33 months in the hosting state or 21 months
while also earning the B1 language certificate which enables you to
qualify for the permanent residency permit earlier. Furthermore, if
you work in different EU member states and gather 5 years of work
experience altogether then you are a strong candidate for the
permanent residency permit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it is clear. 21 months with B1 in the hosting state or 5 years in
different states all put together in the bluecard.</p>

  <p>In case you decide to go back and live in India as a Dutch citizen,
you can live like an Indian citizen except that you cannot vote. You
can reapply for Indian passport after 5yrs of change to Dutch

<p><strong>Bypassing my problems</strong></p>

<p>Apply for PR and apply for passport simultaneously. I am confident I
will get a PR. It will take me atleast 3 years from now to receive it
in hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dutch Citizenship: You can surrender your Indian passport and get a
Netherlands passport.  The prerequisites for citizenship and PR are
same – only that PR takes about 2 months to arrive from the time you
apply for it while the passport will take about 1 year. So a lot of
Indians apply for the PR and also apply for the passport in parallel.

  <p>It is possible to apply for PR and Citizenship at the same time!</p>

<p>People have gotten their Citizenship rejected and Pr not as in the
same post above, for not meeting the requirements. However, appeals
can be made. I need to write soem FB posts and check with others
regarding what works and not.</p>
