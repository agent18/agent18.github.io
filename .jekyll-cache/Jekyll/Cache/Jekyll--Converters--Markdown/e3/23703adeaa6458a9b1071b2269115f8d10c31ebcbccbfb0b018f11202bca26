<p>I have &gt;20% fat I think. Measurements coming soon. I would like to go
to 10%. But first I need to understand what I need to do.</p>

<h2 id="youtube">YouTube</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn0Ygp7pMbA">I start with this ted talk on dieting</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much you weigh depends on how much you eat and how much energy you
burn.</p>

  <p>Hunger and energy are controlled by brain!</p>

  <p>Your brain does its own thing.</p>

  <p>The brain has its own sense of what you should weigh!</p>

  <p>Set point 10 - 15 pounds.</p>

  <p>It works like a thermostat. Keeps things stable.</p>

  <p>Responding to weight loss as though you are starving‚Ä¶ fat or thin
brain response is the same.</p>

  <p>If you do loose, then you are hungry and muscles burn less energy,
i.e. metabolism is supressed.</p>

  <p>Apparently people who lost 10% of BW 250 to 400 cal less as metabolism
is supressed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means they lost weight at Metabolism rate of X%. And now their
brain thinks that they are startving and reduces the avg burning of
energy with a metabolism rate &lt;X% (250-400 cals less).</p>

<p>So at 10% less BW if someone was consuming 2600 cals. To stay at that
for the near future, he needs to eat 2200 cals as his MR has
decreased.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A succesful dieter must eat ‚Äú400 cals‚Äù as compared to someone of the
same weight class.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He has to continue to eat less forever to stay there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh God!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Set points go up, but they do not want to go down.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Successful dieting doens‚Äôt lower your set point, even after 7 years!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changing food environment</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Temporary weight gain can become permanent, if you stay at somethin
for too long</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself or others pandian!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>intuitive eaters and controlled eaters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>less likely</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>hunger activity and metabolism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overall message seems to be that dieting sucks and that we should eat
mindully. What does it mean: most people who diet gain back their
weight in 5 years. Some go higher as these kind of controlled eaters
have it easy to binge. We have limited will power and this might not
be the best place to spend it on.</p>

<p>Risk of death in obese people can be brought to normal if you drink in
moderation, exercise 3 times a week and eat ‚Äúenough veggies‚Äù and
smoke less.</p>

<h2 id="what-and-why">What and why?</h2>

<p>I think I am fat. I have a good belly. I am ashamed and not comfortable
with my body. I eat the sweets and cakes I find in my pantry. I used
to not worry about it.</p>

<p>Is it any surprise that I am more serious about it after someone made
fun of me as to why I was still flabby? even after working out for
almost a year now. This is a sad state of affairs though. I want to
tell myself that I would have done it anyways, but I doubt thats the
case knowing me so well all this while.</p>

<p>10% bf% is really cool in my opinion. I don‚Äôt need to show abs. I just
want to look good (to whom?)</p>

<p>As a by-product</p>

<p>With lifting I have if not completely, atleast partially lost the idea
of having huge muscles, 1. becuase it takes a lot of time and 2. I
enjoy the process of becoming better and maxing out. Every time I beat
my record or even just purely improving and maxing out is great.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-cut">Should I cut?</h2>

<p>An STM I guess is at 10%. I often heard him say it is related to
longevity but on the contrarty I keep seeing <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/3317338/Fitness-not-fat-determines-life-expectancy.html">evidence otherwise
here</a> and in the earlier linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn0Ygp7pMbA">youtube video</a>.</p>

<p>Also in a few weeks I am going to india, I would like to start my
journey although its quite late I think.</p>

<p>As kramer says, ‚ÄúNewman and I are comfortable with our own bodies‚Äù</p>

<p>I think it doesn‚Äôt matter what the evidence says, I just want my 10%
body fat. It gives me motivation to cut sugar etc.</p>

<h2 id="questions-to-be-answered">Questions to be answered</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Is following the scooby diet and its prediction enough?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My weight almost always has remained at 61+-3 kg. I don‚Äôt go out of
my way. I eat happily. I eat less fried food though. Why?</p>

    <p>Why I have not become fatter?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>My point being eating some extra cookies doesn‚Äôt suddenly make you
fatter. Plus since september I have been doing quite some intense
cardio. 4 times a week of 20-24 min cardio and 2-3 hrs basket ball
once a week. I eat as I wish, or the normal amount. I don‚Äôt weigh too
much, I make sure I my protein content is on point and the rest are in
the ball park or even more.</p>

<p>And yet my weight is still the same. Shouldn‚Äôt have all the running
brought down my weight?</p>

<p>If you say I am eating more, I was always eating more.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt have numbers for my fat % count before. But I don‚Äôt I improved
or sucked. I have remained on an average the same.</p>

<p>This is a hard problem and I need someone to tell me how this works
and I am not going to be able to figure it out.</p>

<p>But scooby has a chart, I could check with scooby as well.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to only burn fat?</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason that cardio has gotten a bad reputation for burning muscle
is that most often, people couple drastic diets with cardio in their
effort to ‚Äúcut‚Äù after ‚Äúbulking‚Äù ‚Äì its why I hate the whole bulking
and cutting mentality. ) Its the drastic caloric reduction that is
responsible for the muscle loss, not the cardio! If you don‚Äôt consume
enough protein and enough calories, your body will cannibalize your
muscles ‚Äì a good safe limit is not to reduce your calories by more
than 20% below your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), to find a
muscle-safe caloric intake for dieting please use my calorie
calculator. - <a href="http://scoobysworkshop.com/does-cardio-burn-muscle/">scooby</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cardio does not burn muscle mass, crash diets and bad nutrition burn
muscle mass! 20-40min cardio every day is not only good for your
health but it can help you add muscle as well.- Scooby</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>ALL the mass was lost in their legs ‚Äì why? Overtraining!!!. So if
these athletes can run 43 miles (6 hours) every day all summer long
without losing any upper body muscle mass, certainly YOU can jog for
30 minutes without losing muscle mass! - Scooby</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember, your body is really smart and it wont burn muscle unless
you do something really stupid like running 3000 miles or doing a
drastic fad diet. - Scooby</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right now no threat of burning away muscle as we are not going
overboard. Not going overboard!</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Does taking excess protein add fat?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sugars and fat?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>

<p>Scooby chart and prediction. Test it. Measure every week.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="http://scoobysworkshop.com/calorie-calculator/#charts">Scooby‚Äôs chart </a>, I expect to reduce weight by 0.1 kg per
month. I will check how much BF% this is per week.</p>

<p>1965 cal per day
3 meals a day 40g Protein, 90 g carbs, 14g fat</p>

<p>For this I am going to build an index of things I an eat or not.</p>

<p>For the next one month this is what I want to do @ 10% caloric
reduction to get to 1kg less of fat.</p>
