  <p>And in my humble opinion I feel Jay Z is the bar and will be the bar
until he decides to stop. I don‚Äôt ever see him ‚Äúfalling off‚Äù because
he thinks progressively. A lot of his counterparts he came up with
sound dated. They stopped growing. He mastered forward thinking.</p>

<p>Initial hypothesis: I remember trying to get a grip of what it is that
she is trying to tell me. Something about mindfulness and crap. eating
mindfully. But then she said dieting doesn‚Äôt work. but then mindfulness
is not dieting? or dieting is not mindfulness?  Your body weight
according to your body is something.</p>

  <p>Three and a half years ago, I made (one of the best decisions of my

  <p>This was me at age 13, when I started my first diet. I look at that
picture now, and I think, you did not need a diet, you needed a
fashion consult. (Laughter) But I thought I needed to lose weight, and
when I gained it back, of course I blamed myself. And for the next
three decades, I was on and off various diets. No matter what I tried,
the weight I‚Äôd lost always came back. I‚Äôm sure many of you know the
feeling.</p>

  <p>As a neuroscientist, I wondered, why is this so hard? Obviously,
(how much you weigh)[1] depends on (how much you eat)[2] and (how
much energy you burn)[3]. What most people don‚Äôt realize is that
(hunger)[4] and (energy)[5] use are controlled by (the brain, mostly
without your awareness)[6]. Your (brain)[7] does a (lot of its work)[8a]
(behind the scenes)[8], and that is a (good thing)[9], because your
(conscious mind)[10] ‚Äì how do we put this politely? ‚Äì it‚Äôs (easily
distracted)[11]. It‚Äôs good that you don‚Äôt have to remember to
breathe when you get caught up in a movie. You don‚Äôt forget
how to walk because you‚Äôre thinking about what to have for
dinner.</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [1] depends on [2] and [3] (obviously?).</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: What [1], depends on.</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: on [2] and [3].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: I was 61kg when I left to India. I was 64.5kg when I came
back. The only difference I think is my workout reduced to 5hrs a week
from 11hrs a week. And I ate 3-5 times a day unrestricted and more in
India. I felt the bulge in my stomach increasing over the time in
India.</p>

  <p>Your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh, no matter
what you consciously believe. This is called your set point, but
that‚Äôs a misleading term, because it‚Äôs actually a range of about 10 or
15 pounds. You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and
down within that range, but it‚Äôs much, much harder to stay outside of
it. The hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body
weight, there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that
tell your body to gain weight, more than another dozen that tell your
body to lose it, and the system works like a thermostat, responding to
signals from the body by adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism, to
keep your weight stable as conditions change. That‚Äôs what a thermostat
does, right? It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the
weather changes outside. Now you can try to change the temperature in
your house by opening a window in the winter, but that‚Äôs not going to
change the setting on the thermostat, which will respond by kicking on
the furnace to warm the place back up. Your brain works exactly the
same way, responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push
your body back to what it considers normal. If you lose a lot of
weight, your brain reacts as if you were starving, and whether you
started out fat or thin, your brain‚Äôs response is exactly the same. We
would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to
lose weight or not, but it can‚Äôt. If you do lose a lot of weight, you
become hungry, and your muscles burn less energy. Dr. Rudy Leibel of
Columbia University has found that people who have lost 10 percent of
their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their
metabolism is suppressed. That‚Äôs a lot of food. This means that a
successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the
same weight who has always been thin.</p>

  <p>From an evolutionary perspective, your body‚Äôs resistance to weight
loss makes sense. When food was scarce, our ancestors‚Äô survival
depended on conserving energy, and regaining the weight when food was
available would have protected them against the next shortage. Over
the course of human history, starvation has been a much bigger problem
than overeating. This may explain a very sad fact: Set points can go
up, but they rarely go down. Now, if your mother ever mentioned that
life is not fair, this is the kind of thing she was talking
about. (Laughter) Successful dieting doesn‚Äôt lower your set
point. Even after you‚Äôve kept the weight off for as long as seven
years, your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back. If that
weight loss had been due to a long famine, that would be a sensible
response. In our modern world of drive-thru burgers, it‚Äôs not working
out so well for many of us. That difference between our ancestral past
and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the
University of Ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a
time when food was less available, and it‚Äôs also the reason that
changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective
solution to obesity.</p>

  <p>Sadly, a temporary weight gain can become permanent. If you stay at a
high weight for too long, probably a matter of years for most of us,
your brain may decide that that‚Äôs the new normal.</p>

  <p>Psychologists classify eaters into two groups, those who rely on their
hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower,
like most dieters. Let‚Äôs call them intuitive eaters and controlled
eaters. The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely
to be overweight, and they spend less time thinking about
food. Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response
to advertising, super-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet. And a
small indulgence, like eating one scoop of ice cream, is more likely
to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters. Children are especially
vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging. Several
long-term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early
teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five
years later, even if they started at a normal weight, and all of these
studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also
predicted the development of eating disorders. The other factor, by
the way, those of you who are parents, was being teased by family
members about their weight. So don‚Äôt do that. (Laughter)</p>

  <p>I left almost all my graphs at home, but I couldn‚Äôt resist throwing in
just this one, because I‚Äôm a geek, and that‚Äôs how I roll. (Laughter)
This is a study that looked at the risk of death over a 14-year period
based on four healthy habits: eating enough fruits and vegetables,
exercise three times a week, not smoking, and drinking in
moderation. Let‚Äôs start by looking at the normal weight people in the
study. The height of the bars is the risk of death, and those zero,
one, two, three, four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of
those healthy habits that a given person had. And as you‚Äôd expect, the
healthier the lifestyle, the less likely people were to die during the
study. Now let‚Äôs look at what happens in overweight people. The ones
that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death. Adding just one
healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range. For
obese people with no healthy habits, the risk is very high, seven
times higher than the healthiest groups in the study. But a healthy
lifestyle helps obese people too. In fact, if you look only at the
group with all four healthy habits, you can see that weight makes very
little difference. You can take control of your health by taking
control of your lifestyle, even If you can‚Äôt lose weight and keep it
off.</p>

  <p>08:48 Diets don‚Äôt have very much reliability. Five years after a diet,
most people have regained the weight. Forty percent of them have
gained even more. If you think about this, the typical outcome of
dieting is that you‚Äôre more likely to gain weight in the long run than
to lose it.</p>

  <p>09:08 If I‚Äôve convinced you that dieting might be a problem, the next
question is, what do you do about it? And my answer, in a word, is
mindfulness. I‚Äôm not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up
yoga. I‚Äôm talking about mindful eating: learning to understand your
body‚Äôs signals so that you eat when you‚Äôre hungry and stop when you‚Äôre
full, because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you‚Äôre
not hungry. How do you do it? Give yourself permission to eat as much
as you want, and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel
good. Sit down to regular meals without distractions. Think about how
your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop, and let your
hunger decide when you should be done. It took about a year for me to
learn this, but it‚Äôs really been worth it. I am so much more relaxed
around food than I have ever been in my life. I often don‚Äôt think
about it. I forget we have chocolate in the house. It‚Äôs like aliens
have taken over my brain. It‚Äôs just completely different. I should say
that this approach to eating probably won‚Äôt make you lose weight
unless you often eat when you‚Äôre not hungry, but doctors don‚Äôt know of
any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people,
and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing weight
gain instead of promoting weight loss. Let‚Äôs face it: If diets worked,
we‚Äôd all be thin already. (Laughter) Why do we keep doing the same
thing and expecting different results? Diets may seem harmless, but
they actually do a lot of collateral damage. At worst, they ruin
lives: Weight obsession leads to eating disorders, especially in young
kids. In the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls say they‚Äôve
been on a diet. Our daughters have learned to measure their worth by
the wrong scale. Even at its best, dieting is a waste of time and
energy. It takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids
with their homework or to finish that important work project, and
because willpower is limited, any strategy that relies on its
consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail
you when your attention moves on to something else.</p>

  <p>Let me leave you with one last thought. What if we told all those
dieting girls that it‚Äôs okay to eat when they‚Äôre hungry? What if we
taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it? I think
most of them would be happier and healthier, and as adults, many of
them would probably be thinner. I wish someone had told me that back
when I was 13.</p>

  <p>Thanks.</p>
