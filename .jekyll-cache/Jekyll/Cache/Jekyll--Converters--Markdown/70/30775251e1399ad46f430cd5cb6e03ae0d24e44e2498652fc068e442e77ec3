<p>PG, in his blog post titled <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html">‚ÄúCities and Ambition‚Äù</a>, seems to be
suggesting that we would benefit greatly from moving to our Industry
hub. 80khours writes in its <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/#7-consider-changing-where-you-live">blog post</a>, that people should move to
Silicon Valley for Tech, LA for Entertainment, New York for Finance
etc‚Ä¶ <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpQqh6wCDtfZkeneg/should-you-visit-an-ea-hub">Peter McIntyre of 80khours</a> says that just visiting an EA hub
can lead to a significant change in your career or life.</p>

<p>In this essay we see if it is beneficial to move to or atleast visit
an Industry Hub.</p>

<h2 id="industries-cluster-in-certain-areas">Industries cluster in certain areas</h2>

<p><a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/#7-consider-changing-where-you-live">Three-quarters of the US entertainers live in LA</a>. Anyone who wants
fame, or who wants to be part of the entertainment industry seems to
want to be here. Youtubers, Sitcom folks, Instagram models, Talk-show
hosts etc‚Ä¶ flock this neighborhood. A quick look at the top
Youtubers suggest that many of them live in LA (David Dobrik, Amanda
Cerny, Logan Paul and the like). Sitcoms such as ‚ÄúModern Family‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe
Big Bang Theory‚Äù, ‚ÄúLast Man Standing‚Äù, ‚ÄúHouse M.D‚Äù, are all filmed
here in LA. The hot and happening talk shows such as ‚ÄúThe Late Late
Show With James Corden‚Äù, ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live‚Äù, ‚ÄúConan‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Ellen
DeGeneres show‚Äù etc‚Ä¶ are taped in and around 20 minutes from LA.</p>

<p>However, we do observe that ‚ÄúLast Week Tonight‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Daily Show With
Trevor Noah‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert‚Äù, are taped in
NYC. And looking at the genre I half expect ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù
would also be taped in NYC (AND IT IS). That‚Äôs odd, that these are not
in LA according to our initial hypothesis. But they are still
clustering. All these shows are politically charged and seem to want
to be in NYC (TOGETHER). Maybe it is the timezone with Washington that
brought them to NYC or the type of audience that they need for their
show. I don‚Äôt know. I can only speculate.</p>

<p>Such clustering is not only found in the entertainment industry but
also in several other industries. Take arts for example. <a href="http://www.aboutflorence.com/art-and-culture-of-Florence.html">30% of the
worlds most important works of art are from Florence</a>. Looking at
the Finance world, we see that New York seems to be the ‚ÄúBanking
Capital of the World‚Äù. New York houses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_investment_banks">Largest Revenue Investment
Bank‚Äôs Headquarters</a> (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Chase, Morgan
Stanley, BofA).</p>

<p>The Tech giants Apple, Facebook, Google, EBay, UBER, Lyft, Nvidia,
Intel, KLA, Applied Materials, HP, Adobe, Instagram, Whatsapp, Snap,
Twitter, Netflix, Y-combinator, Tesla, Airbnb, PayPal, SpaceX, Stripe,
Udacity are some of the companies that come to mind and surprisingly
are all Headquartered in this region called the Silicon Valley in
California. Somehow Amazon and Microsoft are not mainly in the Silicon
valley. They do have a small presence there though.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley can also be considered as the startup hub, taking into
account that all those companies listed above were once a startup and
now continue to have their headquarters there. Silicon Valley, has the
highest funding in cumulative dollars for startups. A whopping
<a href="https://inspiration2go.de/fileadmin/user_upload/CB-Insights_Global-Tech-Hubs.pdf">140bn<span>$</span> (from 2012 to 2018)</a>, dwarfs it‚Äôs competitor
in the US (Boston) by almost 4 times. And not surprisingly, it is home
to one of the <a href="https://www.owler.com/company/ycombinator">biggest (by revenue) startup incubators
Y-combinator</a>, which is estimated to bring 100-150 startups into
California every year since 2005.</p>

<p>Even if the hub you are in is not as popular as Silicon Valley, it
still seems to cluster. In Netherlands for example, Eindhoven is
considered the high-tech city. ASML, Philips and NXP are all
headquartered in the same region. In addition many contracted medium
sized companies working for these giants and recruitment agencies are
also in this city. Just 100km away, you will not see much of a sign of
this high-tech environment. If you want jobs in this high-tech
industry, Eindhoven seems to be the only possibility whereas if you
want jobs in off-shore then no point in being close to Eindhoven. When
I lost my job last winter, the opportunities pointed straight and to
the one and only high-tech city, Eindhoven. Period.</p>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt stop here certainly. Clothing stores, supermarkets,
restaurants, hotels cluster in cities as well. I have seen PUMA, NIKE,
Reebok, and Adidas showrooms literally SIDE BY SIDE. Same thing with
shirt brands like Louie Philip, Peter England, Van Heusen and
Raymonds. In the city where I live, there are three to four Turkish
stores where we get Indian spices, within 100ft of each other, and
nothing more anywhere else in the city. Two of them are owned by
brothers and are located literally adjacent to each other.</p>

<p>Most interesting for me is the EA community and if they are clustered
and if so, where they are clustered. I consider organizations are
Effectively Altruistic if 80khours has recognized them <a href="https://80000hours.org/2018/10/2018-talent-gaps-survey/#who-was-sampled">here</a>, or
if they are on the 80khours job boards, or if GiveWell suggests them as
<a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">effective charities</a>. From these we have the following list for SF
area: 80khours (SF, Oxford), GiveWell (San Francisco), Open
Philanthropy project (San Franscisco), 80khours (Oxford and SF),
OpenAI (SF), MIRI (Berkeley), Center for Applied Rationality
(Berkeley), AI Impact (Berkeley), Animal Charity Evaluator (Berkeley
without any office space), Animal Equality (US UK),</p>

<p>The following for UK area: Center for Study of Existential Risk
(Oxford), Future of Humanity Institute (Oxford, UK), Global Priorities
Institute (Oxford), Sentience Institute (London), Giving What We Can
(Oxford), Founders Pledge (London), Centre for Effective Altruism
(Oxford). Against Malaria Foundation (St. Albans UK), Sightsavers
(U.K), Founders Pledge (London).</p>

<p>The following for other areas: Evidence Action (Washington DC), Helen
Keller International (Washington D.C), Give Directly (NYC), Poverty
Action Lab (Cambridge, MA, US), Good Food Institute (Washington D.C,
US), Center for Global Development (Washington D.C, US).</p>

<p>So for the EA community it looks like the clustering does happen in UK
(Oxford, London) and San Francisco area. These regions are the only
regions that host the <a href="https://www.eaglobal.org/">annual EA conferences</a>, not surprisingly.</p>

<h2 id="great-clustered-hubs-attract-super-productive-and-ambitious-people">Great (clustered) hubs attract super-productive and ambitious people</h2>

<p>A small portion of clustered regions seems to be crazy productive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world‚Äôs ten largest urban economic regions hold only 6.5% of the
world‚Äôs population, but account for 57% of patented innovations, 53%
of the most cited scientists and 43% of economic output. This
suggests that, in terms of innovation and economic output, the
people in these regions are about eight times more productive than
the average person. ‚Äî <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/#7-consider-changing-where-you-live">80000hours (Consider changing where you
live)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>LA is hands down one of the largest entertainment hubs with
three-quarters of the entertainers in LA. When you take a look at the
biggest-subscriber-count-Youtubers today, you notice that many of them
were not originally from LA and that they moved to LA in hopes of
furthering their career. David Dobrik had the option to pursue
university (and his parents would support him) or be kicked out of his
house. He decided to get kicked out, moved to LA from Illinois to
pursue his Vine Career. At the time he moved to LA (at the age of 19),
groceries of 25<span>$</span> was a lot of money for him. Today he can
be seen buying his friends Lamborghini‚Äôs even. He has 6 million views
everyday on his Youtube channels and has risen to 15 million
subscribers in a matter of 4 years.</p>

<p>Lily Singh, another Youtuber moved in December 2015 to LA all the way
from Toronto, Canada. Today she is the first woman late night talk
show host. Liza Koshy from Houston (18 mill subs), Lele Pons from
Miami (15 mill subs), Logan and Jake Paul (20 mill subs) from Ohio,
etc.. moved to LA to further their career and boy have they peaked (in
subs) during their time here.</p>

<p>NYC is home to the largest investment banks in the world. A friend of
mine from college decided to write CAT exams, got into a pretty good
school in India and went into the world of Investment Banking. Now he
finally earned the opportunity to work in NYC. Very few people get
this opportunity. He knows he has to work 28 days a month, but he
doesn‚Äôt care. He knows he will have to be available on call 24x7, but
he doesn‚Äôt care. He also knows this will be great for his career and
savings, and is willing to do whatever it takes.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley, is the largest funding hub for startups in the world
hands down with <a href="https://inspiration2go.de/fileadmin/user_upload/CB-Insights_Global-Tech-Hubs.pdf">140bn<span>$</span> in funding (from 2012 to
2018)</a>. The current internet giant Facebook in 2004, was passed on
by Battery Ventures from Boston after which they moved to Silicon
Valley and the rest is history. To get a feel of the kind of people
starting up nowadays and entering Silicon Valley we need to look no
further than Y-combinator, the startup accelerator. It is estimated to
have about <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/y-combinator-application-interview-advice-from-a-winter-18-alumni-b53a6d85fc48">10000 applications</a> (as of 2017), and about 150
startups get selected to move to Silicon Valley and undergo the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">3
month workshop</a>. This is an acceptance rate of ~1% (while
Harvard‚Äôs acceptance rate is 5% (2017)).</p>

<p>Again, the most interesting for me is the EA community. SF and UK are
home to some of the greatest EA organizations such as GiveWell which
has moved about <a href="https://www.givewell.org/about/impact">160m<span>$</span> in 2018</a> to charitable
organizations, and Against Malaria foundation which moved about
<a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/DonationStatistics.aspx">40m<span>$</span> last year to help rid Malaria</a> in poor African
countries. Both SF and UK seem to attract ambitious people from around
the world to work in these organizations.</p>

<p>Peter McIntyre who co-founded EA Australia, which has raised over
3M<span>$</span> for EA work, seems to have found his way as director
of Recruiting in 80khours, Oxford. Brenton Mayer who also co-founded
EA Australia, is now in 80khours in Berkeley as Co-head of
Coaching. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/">Tara MacAulay</a>, who saved <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/tara/">a million dollars a year</a>
to the hospital she was working at, moved to Oxford and later to CEA
as part of her work as a chief in the Centre for Effective Altruism.
There are another <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpQqh6wCDtfZkeneg/should-you-visit-an-ea-hub">6 similar stories of ‚Äúambitious people‚Äù who
have moved to these hubs all the way from Australia</a>.</p>

<p>Ambitious people from all industries seem to be attracted to such
great hubs.</p>

<h2 id="persuasion-it-matters-the-type-of-message-the-city-sends-you">Persuasion: It matters the type of message the city sends you</h2>

<p>How much does it matter that we move to a great hub? It appears to be
a lot.</p>

<p>Florence is estimated by UNESCO to have <a href="http://www.aboutflorence.com/art-and-culture-of-Florence.html">30% of the world‚Äôs most
important art</a>. How did Florence alone produce so much art when
Milan is just as big as Florence and would have had similarly
genetically capable people? It appears that if you were born in
Florence then you had a better chance of producing art than when you
were in Milan. Somehow if you were in Florence your values became:
‚ÄúART is important‚Äù, and not as much when you were in Milan. In other
words (somehow), people in Florence seem to be <em>persuaded</em> to pick up
ART almost as if by virtue of being in that place.</p>

<p>This type of persuasion, aka absorption of values of a region, seems
to be found in great hubs. Will MacAskill, founder of 80khours and
Centre for Effective Altruism, writes <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/">here</a> about his experience
of going through Y-Combinator (moving to Silicon Valley):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But at group office hours, I‚Äôd often feel like one of the least
competent people in the room; and the organization I was helping run
was doing merely fine by YC startup standards. This pushed me to work
even harder and optimize my time even further. ‚Äî<a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/">Will
MacAskill</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being in the startup hub seems to have pushed Will towards working
harder than he normally does on his startup. (Somehow), he felt
<em>persuaded</em>, to become better and rise up to YC startup standards.</p>

<p>Persuasion happens not only in great hubs. I have felt similarly as
Will, at my work place. Recently I moved to a new team. All of them
are definitely better than me in designing. The team assessed my task
would take 8 days. This was going to be hard for me considering I had
no experience in it. So I started working more hours, was thinking
about the problems at sleep, and couldn‚Äôt excercise in the morning as
I was anxious to work on the problem in the mornings. I made this PRIO
I (despite having other important things to work on which I will talk
about later). I postponed my passport renewal cause I couldn‚Äôt
concentrate on it. And lastly I didn‚Äôt care anymore about spending
time traveling to V-town which would mean an additional loss of 3-6
hours a week from my personal time, not to mention tiredness from
traveling.</p>

<p>Like Will MacAskill, I (somehow) seem to be persuaded by my
surroundings to work harder. Great, right? Unfortunately, I am putting
all this effort into something that is not my priority. I should be
working on figuring out if I should go into EA or Data Science. Its
been many many months and I have not reached any conclusion. And here
I am, working harder and harder on designing machines, despite knowing
that I <em>cannot be fired</em> from my job and that most likely I need to
switch careers. The fact that the office is not at all important and
it is just for a steady income, doesn‚Äôt seem to matter regarding what
I spend my time on. The sad part is I don‚Äôt think I can get out of
such persuasions. The next time I have such a deadline in this team, I
will do more than the 40hr work week, to make sure that the deadlines
are met. I will get anxious about work. I will go to V-town and spend
additional hours from my personal time. I cannot not care about
delivering results in said time (because my colleagues seem to
care). Similarly, I cannot not care about the salary appraisal at the
end of the year (because others do). (Somehow) the higher you are
appraised, the better, regardless of its insignificant contribution in
<span>$</span> to your life. I can‚Äôt help but feel bad when I get a
shitty appraisal. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be in my control to choose to
value appraisals differently than my peers. It‚Äôs atleast going to be
really hard to care less about these things.</p>

<p>An STM has talked about <a href="http://pradeep90.github.io/how-to-get-persuaded.html">such persuasions</a> in his IIT days and
Master‚Äôs days, where he tried to not care about grades and
internships. I used to wonder, why it was so hard to behave
differently, when he wanted to behave differently. I guess I
understand now after the above example that I am not in full control
of my feelings. And to a good extent (as evidenced above), persuasion
seems to be king. Even if I wanted to, even if it ‚Äúmade sense‚Äù, I was
still going to be at the mercy of my surroundings.</p>

<p>Persuasion actually happens everywhere. When I play basketball on
Sunday, I am persuaded to practice a day before so that I don‚Äôt suck
at the court as much. I feel persuaded to not eat alone in a
restaurant in Netherlands, possibly because I only see people in
groups laughing and ‚Äúhaving a good time‚Äù. It is just tough and feels
wrong even, to eat alone. I am persuaded to have a girlfriend when I
am around couples giggling, holding hands, PDAing.</p>

<p>Persuasion might not be the best thing for us in all cases as seen
above. But the not-so-good-persuasion is not an incurable disease. It
seems to continue to haunt you until the memory lasts/exists. Last
month when I went to India, I didn‚Äôt care about working harder at
all. Hell, I didn‚Äôt care about improving my skills either so that I
could be appraised better. In fact I was focused on something
completely different. I was more worried about being a good
entertainer at gatherings, getting better at small talk and talking to
girls than freaking anything else. These are things typically that I
would care less about here in Netherlands. Like I had a switch on what
I value, and it swapped entirely when I moved from one region to the
other.</p>

<p>The persuasion I feel on Sunday Basketball games, typically lasts 2
days in intensity. By the end of the week it drops to 0. I don‚Äôt feel
motivated to practice anymore. I don‚Äôt remember how badly I sucked
anymore. But the moment I set foot on the court and play a game, the
persuasion starts to peak again.</p>

<p>Similarly, when I am locked in my room grinding for 7 hours on this
article on a weekend, I couldn‚Äôt care less about girls, girlfriends,
or anything else that the world wishes to persuade me into. No wonder
an STM quit his job at 25 and moved away from civilization to work on
things that were important to him. It all makes sense now 5 years
later.</p>

<p>Indeed persuasion is everywhere. The power of the bad-persuasion makes
us do things which is not our PRIO I. So we would like to either seek
good-persuasion or atleast stay away from bad-persuasion. If we want
to be great like the artists of Florence in the 15th century, we
should probably move to the hub Florence, because
(Paraphrasing PG) if someone in Milan with the same natural ability as
Leonardo Da Vinci (from Florence), couldn‚Äôt beat the force of
persuasion, do you suppose you can? Why fight the force, when you can
use it to propel you in the right direction!</p>

<p>We should aim only for the greatest hubs (in our field), as that is
where the ambitious people are at (as seen in the previous
section). And that is the characteristic of persuasion that drives Will
MacAskill (founder of TWO EA Organizations) and hopefully us, to work
even harder than we usually do ON THINGS THAT ARE TRULY PRIO I.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-moving-to-a-great-hub">Benefits of moving to a Great Hub</h2>

<p>There seems to be more to moving to a great hub than just the
persuasion. I have experienced first hand what working with smart
people can do to you. If they are in your team that is freaking
great. Just the feedback they provide can teach you things that you
can‚Äôt learn from a book. But they don‚Äôt even need to be in your
team. They just need to be around. I randomly approached top people in
my old company who I had 0 contact with and they were more than
willing to guide me in work related tasks.</p>

<p>Money is another advantage of moving to great hubs. It is usually
higher than in a non-great hub. Average pay of a <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/netherlands-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,11_IN178_KO12,26.htm">data scientist in
California is around 150k<span>$</span></a>. Average pay of a <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/netherlands-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,11_IN178_KO12,26.htm">data
scientist in Netherlands is 80k<span>$</span></a>.  And if you end up
at places like Facebook and Apple it is expected to go as high as 180k
or 190k, for the first year even. The story is similar with other
industries as well. A friend of mine who was an Investment Bank
Analyst, went from his job in India to a job in New York. His salary
went from roughly 25k<span>$</span> in India to 180k<span>$</span> in
New York.</p>

<p>Networking, future possibilities and exit opportunities seem to be
other crucial advantages. <a href="https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/">Milan Griffes</a> who worked for GiveWell
(SF) informs that prior to working there he was in Michigan and not
familiar with the EA community at all. And that when he considered
leaving GiveWell after 2 years in the HUB, three of the opportunities,
including the one he accepted was enabled by his EA network. Needless
to say there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/business/hollywood-apartment-social-media.html">parallels to this in other Great hubs such as LA</a>
as well.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, it appears that moving to a GREAT HUB such as SF for
EA, NYC for Finance, Silicon Valley for tech and startup scene
etc‚Ä¶ seems to be a great idea, considering dimensions such as
persuasion, increase in work-ethic, ambitiousness, learning best
practices, money-wise, networking and future possibilities.</p>

<p>In the case that we are not able to move to such a great hub, we
should surround ourselves with like minded people and should atleast
plan ‚Äúregular‚Äù visits or attend conferences to absorb or recharge the
values provided by the said GREAT HUB.</p>

<p>An account of 14 people who decided to take a trip to the EA hubs
Oxford and SF region is presented <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpQqh6wCDtfZkeneg/should-you-visit-an-ea-hub">here</a>. Of these 14 people 12
thought it would increase their overall impact. 9 of them moved to one
of the hubs. Many of them informed that taking this trip changed their
plans of what they should be working on. Such seems to be the power of
a Great Hub. Peace!</p>
