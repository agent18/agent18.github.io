<p>The path I want to take with discovering the truth- something that I might not have data on as it is in the future- is similar to what we saw with <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/break-cryonics-down.html">Robin hanson</a> in his essay series on cryonics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Break it down</p>

<p>Write out different events, and come up with their probabilities somehow.</p>

<h4 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h4>
<p>My friend sends me <a href="https://dontmarry.wordpress.com/">this article</a> long back, in 2014. Prior to that he lists several reasons why it is going to be a pain. I am here to investigate the claims, summarize the arguments and make a conclusion.</p>

<h4 id="article">Article</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://dontmarry.wordpress.com/">article</a> is actually a post/thread <a href="http://mgtow.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=415&amp;page=1">“Married Men- Post here if you hate your life”</a>. But for some reason the site is dead. The author “happyghost”, in <a href="https://dontmarry.wordpress.com/">this article</a> had made a backup of the post by copying things to his notepad after removing the “noise” and “keeping the good stuff”. I am not sure what it means, but for now I am going to assume that he has not deleted people writing in favor of marriage, and that by noise he means, useless comments that trash other authors or comments such as thanks probably.</p>

<p>The post predominantly has people who are married and hate their marriage. I assume that all the people who seem to have happy-marriages, also had equal access and could have contributed to the post. But right now, from this post it seems like those people don’t exist at all!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A statistical impossibility for ALL the men in this thread to have married the “wrong woman”.<br />
-someone in the thread</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well!</p>

<p>From the post I get the impression that there are two phases within a woman. A pre-marriage phase, and a post marriage phase. Some people referred to it as Jekyll and Hyde. The warning being that the person you marry before marriage is not the same person after marriage</p>

<p>If there were any doubts in your mind before reading this regarding marriage, hopefully you are able to easily see what needs to be done.</p>

<p>Why does my brother and all my cousins and parents think they should marry and go on to say that I should marry? odd!</p>
