	match, either the claim is wrong or your example or reasoning
	is faulty. Either way you get the valuable information that

<p>Mission #8: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
identify the question and answer in each claim, come up with an
example for the question, fill-in-the-blank for the answer yourself,
and compare to the claimed answer.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On one hand, the presence of reaction forces acting in the direction
of the constraint generally renders the equilibrium description more
complex, since those unknown forces must be determined along the
entire trajectory such that kinematical constraints are satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>(You can ignore ‚Äúbecause‚Äù statements for now.)</strong></p>

<p>Take on passages that you are confused about. That way, you will know

<p><strong>C&amp;Q</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Omitting variables)[A] results in (bias in the coefficients of
interest)[B] - unless (their regressors are uncorrelated with the omitted
ones)[C].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [A] results in [B] if [C] is false.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [A] results in <em>__</em> if [C] is false</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take the following data as an example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>n = 10000
x1 = rnorm(n); x2 = 1 * x1 + rnorm(n); 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y=x1+x2</code>. The goal with linear regression (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lm</code>) is to find the
coefficient of x1; given y, x2 and x2 data.</p>

<p>For A, we think of omitting x2. Instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lm(y~x1+x2)</code>, we
do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lm(y~x1)</code>, to determine the coefficient of x1.</p>

<p>For B: The actual slope of x1 is 1 (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y=x1+x2</code>), but when you omit x2,
you get a higher value for the slope of x2 (2.019), i.e., BIAS.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>lm(y~x1)    # not including x2 in the model
          x1 
  2.01945683 
lm(y~x1+x2) # including x1 and x2 in the model      
	      x1          x2 
   1.0074283   1.0104000
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>[C]‚Äì&gt;  unless their (regressors)[4] are (uncorrelated)[5] with the (omitted
ones)[6]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the above case the regressors (x1) show a correlation of 0.7 with
the omitted regressor (x2).</p>

<p>If the regressors are uncorrelated (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x1=rnorm(n), x2=rnorm(n)</code>)
i.e., x1 and x2 show a correlation of 0.02, then case [A] results in
NO [B] as [C] is True. As observed below there is no bias as the
coefficients when including and excluding x2 is the same.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>lm(y~x1)    # not including x2 in the model
	      x1 
  0.97783187 
  
lm(y~x1+x2) # including x1 and x2 in the model 
          x1          x2

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>For 1, we think of abnormal working hours (80 hrs/week) and working 28
days a month, continuously.</p>

<p>For 2, we think of Investment Banking, Trading.</p>

<p>For 3, I think of not taking up jobs in IB due to the fear of burning out?</p>

<p><em>How do you test ‚Äúseems like‚Äù? how do you test ‚Äúopinions?‚Äù At this

<blockquote>
  <p>I am (quite afraid)[4] of the (extremely long hours)[5],

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claims:</strong> IB has [5]</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> IB has <em>__</em> hours for work/week?</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> IBer‚Äôs work from <a href="http://www.askivy.net/articles/investment-banking/investment-banking-lifestyle/working-hours-in-investment-banking">70 to 100 hrs per week</a>, this means
10 to 14 hrs for 7 days a week.</p>

<p><strong>Claims:</strong> IB forces you into [6]</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> IB <em>__</em> facetime</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: ‚ÄúMy group is ~15 people. I have to be at my desk all the
time. If my associates / VPs call me the first thing they ask is ‚Äúare
you in the office‚Äù even if it is a weekend. They call me in on
weekends when they are there just in case work comes up they want me
to be accessible. I can never leave before anyone more senior that me
or I get a staffing email the next day because they assume I am not
working on anything / I am not busy.‚Äù ‚Äî <a href="https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/facetime">wallstreet oasis forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Claims:</strong> IB results in [7]</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> IB results in <em>__</em> to health</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong> ‚ÄúConstant heart palpitations due to caffeine/energy
drinks/stress Carpal tunnel / tendinitis. Lost a lot of hair. Put on 25
lbs or more (fat, not muscle). Stress lowered my immune response to the
point that I got a serious infection that landed me in the hospital
(it started out small but spread to my veins). Became borderline
alcoholic (was having 4-5 drinks every day after work, sometimes
before work although not that often)‚Äù, within 3 years of working in
IB. ‚Äî testimony of an IBer on <a href="https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/how-much-damage-has-banking-done-to-your-life">wallstreet oasis forum</a></p>

<p>For [7], we think of stress eating junk food or avoiding food
altogether to meet deadlines, and the inability to do cardio 5 times a
week.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: I am (quite afraid)[8] to work in IB due to the ‚Äúlack of
supporting conditions‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: I am ___ to work in IB‚Ä¶</p>

  <p>(I might be able to do it)[1] for (a few years)[2], but not for

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Might be able to work in IB for &lt; 2-5 years</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:  Have you worked in ‚Äúsimilar conditions to IB‚Äù for 2-5
years, in the past?</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> During my IIT days, I regularly worked 6-7 days for &gt;10
hrs easily. I had ‚Äúquite some stress‚Äù, due to making mistakes in work,
or not being good enough and trying to show that I am much better than
I actually am. I slept at weird times and was always at work until 8 pm
or even more. This happened for about 1-1.5 years.</p>

<!-- During my Master's, I worked every single day for more than 10hrs for -->
<!-- 12 months straight, including most weekends. -->

<!-- Nowadays, I do a 40 hr workweek and for the past couple of weeks have -->
<!-- been averaging 65 to 75 hrs work weeks although I don't hate working -->
<!-- like previous examples, and don't have a crazy boss. -->

<p>For ‚Äúsimilar conditions to IB‚Äù, I think of 70-100 hrs a week, not
being able to do cardio every day, the need to facetime.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: I might not be able to work for long at IB</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Have there been others who have not been able to work
for 15 years?</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> This guy moved to Private Equity within 3 years of

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [A] for &lt; [B], is not the best option, <del>because it takes
[C] to reach [D]</del></p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [A] for ___, is not the best option</p>

<p><em>We skip the because part!</em></p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Within 15 years you are able to save only ~<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uclRbujg4o9DTXxjVmwKU7-_lhe8AwQ7rQdIl3LhLzQ/edit#gid=307272509">900
lives</a> (based on <a href="http://www.careers-in-finance.com/ibsal.htm">this</a>); not including the ‚Äúpersonal fit‚Äù‚Äù,
which will probably bring the value down ‚Äúfurther‚Äù. With joining an
EAO like GiveWell it seems like you can make a contribution of <a href="https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/">97k$
per year</a> by working there. This seems to allow for &gt;1000 lives
over a 40 year career.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [A] for &gt; [B] seems like one of the best options
considering impact alone (not including personal fit).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [A] for &gt; <em>__</em> seems like one of the best options for

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Over a 30 year career if a person earns on average 800k$

  <p>On the other hand, solving the (equilibrium equations)[1] in the

useful since, (in that direction, the trajectory is prescribed by
the constraint and thus known)[3].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: Solving [1] along [2], is not useful because [3]</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Solving [1] along <em>__</em> is not useful ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>For [1] along [2], we think of  the following equation along the
pendulum bar.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$T = mg \sin{\theta}$</code></p>

<p>For [3], we think of the constant distance of R in the direction of
the bar of the pendulum which NEVER changes.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: In Pg 22 of the book, there is no discussion or usage of
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$T = mg \sin{\theta}$</code> for the determination of the equation of
motion equation <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ml^2 \ddot{\theta} + mgl \sin{\theta}=0$</code>. Hence not

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: In [1], only [2] needs to be determined.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>: In [1] only <em>__</em> needs to be determined</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: In [1], the pendulum can only move along the spherical
surface. That is the only motion to be determined. There is no motion
along the direction of the radius of the pendulum and hence it doesn‚Äôt
need to be determined.</p>

<p>For 1, we think of this image from the text book</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(In doing so)[1], (the reaction forces, which act in the direction

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [2] is not needed for [3] because of [1]</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [2] is <em>__</em> for [3]‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: On pg 22 of the book, we see the derivation for the
equations of motion of a simple pendulum. We notice the complete
absence of this reaction force (tension force), in the final equation
(as well as the entire derivation).</p>

<p>For [1], we think of the system described above, where the motion is

<p><em>Because statement</em></p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [4] does not require solving [6]</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>: [4] does <em>__</em> solving [6]</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: The position of the particle normal to the parabola
(along the bar of the pendulum), is always going to be the length of
the pendulum. At 30 degrees the position is the length of the
pendulum, at 90 degrees the position along the normal to the parabola

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: When [1] is present, we consider [2a] only along [2].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: When [1] is present, we consider [2a] only along <em>__</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: On Pg 22, we see that the simple pendulum, has a
constraint of staying on a circle (via the bar of length L).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$u_{1} = L \cos{\theta}$</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$u_{1} = L \sin{\theta}$</code></p>

<p>The coefficients extracted are:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\delta u_1 = -l \sin{\theta} \delta \theta$</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\delta u_2 =  l \cos{\theta} \delta \theta$</code></p>

<p>When you divide the coefficients Y by X, you get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$-\tan(\theta)$</code>,
which is nothing but the slope of the circle traced by the
pendulum for the current coordinate system, u1 facing down and u2
facing to the right. This shows that the virtual displacements are

(orthogonal to unknown reaction forces)[6]. The (form (1.5))[7] thus
involves only (effectively applied forces)[8] and stipulates that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [4] describes projection of [4a] on [5]</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [4]  describes <em>__</em> of [4a] on [5]</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: As we see below, [4] is nothing but the dot product
(projection) of [4a] on [5].</p>

<p>For 4a, we think of equilibrium equations in X and Y</p>

<p>X: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(T \cos{\theta} - mg + m \ddot{u_1})$</code> <br />
Y: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2})$</code></p>

<p>For 5, we think of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$l \delta \theta$</code> which in X and Y direction is:</p>

<p>X:<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$u1 = -l \sin{\theta} \delta\theta$</code> <br />
Y: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$u2 = -l \cos{\theta} \delta \theta$</code></p>

<p>For [4], we think of multiplying the equilibrium equations with
virtual displacements as shown in the above picture.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(T \cos{\theta} - mg + m \ddot{u_1}) \times (-l \sin{\theta}) + (T
\sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2}) (l \cos{\theta}) $</code></p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [5] is [6]</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [5] <em>__</em> [6]</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> The slope of the virtual displacements is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$-tan(\theta)$</code>, which is tangent to the circle. This is orthogonal
to the Tension forces in the simple pendulum.</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [7] involves only [8]</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [7] involves only [8]</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>In the example given for [4] we have:</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [1] is of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$f(\xi_{ik},t)=0$</code></p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\sqrt{x^2+y^2} - L = 0$</code></p>

<p>This is a holonomic constraint for the simple pendulum, where the
distance between the ball and the origin is given by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./images/images-DP-3/scleronomic.png" alt="scleronomic" /></p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [1] is defined by [2]</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: <!-- `$f(\xi_{ik},t)=\sum^3_{i=1} -->
<!-- (\xi_{i2}-\xi_{i1})^2-l^2=0$` --> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\sqrt{x^2+y^2} - L = 0$</code></p>

<p>Here we see that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x,y &amp; t</code> are written on the same side of
the equation, equated to 0 (implicit).</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: if [3], then [4] is said to be [4a]</p>

<p><em>This claim cannot really be verified as scleronomic is a label given

<p>An example of the [4a] is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\sqrt{x^2+y^2} - L = 0$</code></p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: If not [3], then [4] is said to be [4b]</p>

<p>An example of [4b] is:</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: In the 2d pendulum example, without the bar constraint
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\sqrt{x^2+y^2} - L = 0$</code>, the pendulum ball is free to move in all

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\dot{y_1} - r \dot{\phi} \sin{\theta}$</code></p>

<p>The equations have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\dot{x_1}$</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\dot{\phi}$</code> in it.</p>

<p><em>For ‚Äúoften‚Äù ‚Äúgenerally‚Äù, I would think I should give atleast one more

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [4] with [5] is not ‚Äúgenerally‚Äù [6]</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>: [4] with [5] is <em>__</em> [6]</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: The constraints shown below cannot be integrated as
there are two variables in one term, i.e., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\theta$</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\phi$</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\dot{x_1} + r \dot{\phi} \cos{\theta}=0$</code></p>

<p>Contrast this to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\theta$</code> being fixed. We are able to integrate it to:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$x_1 + r \phi \cos{\theta_{fixed}} = 0$</code> i.e., a holonomic constraint.</p>

<p><strong>Example2</strong>: The constraints shown below CAN be integrated although
they seem to be in the non-holonomic form.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\dot{x_0}+\dot{y_0} = 0$</code></p>

<p>Upon closer examination, once integrated they turn out to be holonomic
constraints. I guess as a result this is not a non-holonomic
constraint and non-holonomic constraints must not be integrable.</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [4] with [5] are generally [6] and therefore does not
reduce [7]</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>: [4] with [5] are generally not [6] and therefore does
not <em>__</em> [7]</p>

<p><strong>Example1</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="./images/images-DP-3/non-holo.png" alt="non-holo png" /></p>

<p>We need 8 variables to know the position of the plate in the
co-ordinate system (DOFs):</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, \phi, \theta$</code></p>

<p>The following are the non-holonomic constraints:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\dot{x_1} + r \dot{\phi} \cos{\theta}$</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\dot{y_1} - r \dot{\phi} \sin{\theta}$</code></p>

<p>The following are the holonomic constraints:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$x2-x1 = r \sin{\phi} \cos{\theta}$</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$y2-y1 = r \sin{\phi} \sin{\theta}$</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$z2-z1 = -r \cos{\phi}$</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$z1 = r$</code></p>

<p>With holonomic constraints just by simple substitution we reduce the
DOFs by 1 for each constraint. So we now have 4 dofs (8-4). The two
non-holonomic constraints seem to not reduce the DOF‚Äôs!</p>

<p>Initial DOFs: 8
Holonomic constraints: 4
non-holonomic constraints: 2
Final Dofs: 4 (8-4)</p>

<p><strong>Example2</strong>: With the moving origin of a pendulum example,</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\dot{x_0}+\dot{y_0} = 0$</code> can be reduced to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$x_0 + y0 = constant$</code>
by integration; With an initial condition this constant will be
known. This is nothing but is in the form of holonomic constraint.</p>

<p>Initial DOFS: 3 ($\theta$, x0,y0)
holonomic constraint disguised as a non-holonomic constraint: 1
Final DOFS after constraint: 2 ($\theta$ &amp; x0)</p>

<p><em>Not sure what ‚Äúarbitrarily chosen‚Äù means. This is something that I

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p><em>[8] is without the reaction forces</em></p>

<p>We know the equilibrium equations for the simple pendulum
from before,</p>

<p>X: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(T \cos{\theta} - mg + m \ddot{u_1}) = 0$</code> <br />
Y: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2}) = 0$</code></p>

<p>The above equilibrium is multiplied by the direction of generalized

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(T \cos{\theta} - mg + m \ddot{u_1}) \times (-l \sin{\theta}) = 0$</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ (T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2}) (l \cos{\theta}) = 0$</code></p>

<p>We continue to have the equation = 0; here n=1, N=1, i varies 1..2.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [2] does not support [3], considering [1].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [2] does not support [3] considering <em>__</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: With working as a design engineer, skills like
statistics are very rarely used during my work and hence not
learnt. These are the <a href="https://www.givewell.org/about/jobs/research-positions">skills that seem to be required for
EAO‚Äôs like GiveWell</a>.</p>

<p>For [1], we think of skills such as statistics, managing an
organization/team.</p>

<p>For [2], we think of working in the lithography industry as a design
engineer for the next 5-10 years.</p>

<p>For [3], we think of working in an EAO like GiveWell or 80000 hrs in
the roles of management or analyst.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [2] is not good for [5].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Salary for [2] <em>__</em> Salary for [6].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>Mechanical Design engineer jobs in the KLA San Francisco: <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salary/KLA-Mechanical-Design-Engineer-US-Salaries-EJI_IE1557.0,3_KO4,30_IL.31,33_IN1.htm?experienceLevel=ONE_TO_THREE">119k avg

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [6] <em>__</em> [2] considering [8]</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>DS at Facebook gives ‚Äúmore skills‚Äù in statistics and more salary, than
DE at ASML and hence is a better choice.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [6] ‚Äúseems like‚Äù [7] w.r.t [2] considering [9].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [6] <em>__</em> [2] considering [9].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>DS at Facebook involves a ‚Äúlot more statistics‚Äù than DE in ASML/KLA,
which is needed at EAO‚Äôs like GiveWell.</p>

<p><em>I suspect you are going to say this is not an example! If so, then
the example I would need to come up with is something like, A did DS
and went to GiveWell, and B did DE and didn‚Äôt go to GiveWell. But such

<p>For [7], we think of performing linear regression analysis with
multiple variables everyday as a DS than once in a 3 months as a DE.</p>

<p>For [9], we think of working in GiveWell.</p>

<p><strong>C&amp;Q</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although (Starting-up)[1] has (unbelievable potential for impact)[2],
and (pretty good CC)[3], it still (sucks as an option)[4] because of
the (very poor personal fit)[5]. In case (great potential)[6] is
foreseen in (some startup idea)[7] or there is an option to (join a
startup)[8], an (evaluation of current options)[9] must be done
then. (Starting-up)[10] is (not for me now)[11].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] has [2].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Does [1] have [2]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: According to <a href="https://80000hours.org/2014/05/how-much-do-y-combinator-founders-earn/#fn:5">80000 hrs</a>, founders from the first 5
years of Y Combinator are now worth 18 million after 5-9 years. If 50%
is donated this would mean a savings of 1800 lives at 5k<span>$</span>
per life. Contrast this to DE Netherlands, where you could save about
200 lives over a 40 year career! JFC!</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] is [3].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Does [1] have [3]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: I don‚Äôt know.</p>

<p>For ‚Äúpretty good‚Äù we think of ???</p>

<p>For ‚ÄúCC‚Äù we think of ???</p>

<p><em>‚Äúpretty good‚Äù compared to what?</em></p>

<p><em>I think I maybe get your frustration on using ‚ÄúCC‚Äù now. The
definition of CC is so broad, everything could be good CC, unless, you
look at impact. For example, DS is ‚Äúgood CC‚Äù, as it gives skills in
statistics. Starting up gives ‚Äúgood CC‚Äù</em> even if you fail as you have
‚Äúmanagement skills‚Äù. These are absolutely useless statements, as there
is no number associated with it. Ultimately the only thing we care
about is IMPACT. I would rather, ‚ÄòDS allows you to save N1 lives‚Äô,
‚ÄòStarting up allows you to save N2 lives when you fail‚Äô. It was
painful to think of examples and struggle with WORDS, LABELS and
definitions! Am I wrong?*</p>

<p><em>This would mean to not deal with these words at all anymore?</em></p>

<p><em>And please do call out such words, so I can rid them off my
dictionary as well!</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] is [4] because of [5].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is [1], [4] because of [5]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The effective impact is obtained by multiplying the
chance of success with potential impact.</p>

<p>With startups the chance of success for me currently as <a href="http://agent18.github.io/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html">calculated
here</a> (in the ‚Äúfounding startup‚Äù section), is 0.03%, i.e., the
effective impact is<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> 0.03%*1800</code> lives = 0.54 lives over a lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: if [6] is seen in [7] then [9] must be done.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: if [6] is seen in [7] then [9] <em>__</em> be done.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: In case we come across a startup idea like AirBnb, i.e.,
one that has never been done before and if scaled all over the world
can make a lot of money, <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-planning-tool/">evaluating your options as shown by 80k
hours</a>.</p>

<p><em>I don‚Äôt have an example, but it ‚Äúseems like a good thing to do‚Äù. It‚Äôs
still a claim. I agree. What should I do in these cases?</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: if [6] is seen in [8] then [9] must be done.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: If [6] is seen in [8] the [9] must be done.</p>

<p><em>Same as above!</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [10] is [11].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is [10], [11]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: if you look at my current personal fit, it is at 0.03%
leading to an expected value of 0.54 lives saved per lifetime. If I
continue working where I do right now as a DE, I am guaranteed to save
&gt;100 lives.</p>

<p><strong>C&amp;Q</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An (Economics PhD)[1] shall be done for either (getting into
academia)[2] or getting into (places like government institutions
where you might rarely get a chance to change many lives)[3]. The
(effective impact)[4] of a (career in academia)[2] is estimated as
(624 lives)[6], where as the (maximum impact of a tenure track
position)[7] is (582 (which is &lt;624) lives)[8]. This implies that
the (failure paths chosen in the decision tree)[9] have (probably
much higher impact)[10] (which is also the case)[11].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] is done for [2].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is [1] needed for [2]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p><em>Unfortunately, when I looked at MITs Poverty Action Lab, they seemed
to want in their requirements masters and bachelors in economics with
X years of experience. I didn‚Äôt find PhD requirements except for 1
position of post-doctorate. Also Robin Hanson‚Äôs interview <a href="https://80000hours.org/2013/10/the-value-of-economics-phds-a-conversation-with-robin-hanson/">here</a>
seems like labels after labels. So I am really not sure, if Econ PhD
is the right one for getting into places like MITs Poverty Action Lab</em>
(or ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù).</p>

<p><em>I am not sure what kind of impact these boys in ‚Äúacademia can have‚Äù
especially because of an Econ Phd.</em></p>

<p>For [2], we think of getting into <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/economics-phd/">academia like the ‚ÄúMITs Poverty
Action Lab</a>, for ending extreme poverty‚Äù and gaining
<span>XXX $</span> of impact.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] is done for [3].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is [1] done for [3]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: we think of <a href="http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html">this blog post‚Äôs owner</a>, who informs
about his job in the government and how he had an impact of saving 400
lives once in his career in addition to donations that he makes.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [4] in [2] is [6].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [4] in [2] is <em>__</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Effective impact calculation that I have done earlier was
based on some extrapolation, and I didn‚Äôt spend too much  time into it
as I knew I was not going to take it up any way.</p>

<p>I would assume the impact is similar to an EAO like 80khours i.e., ~1k
lives saved over a 40 year career. With Econ PhD, I guess it is like a
30 year career only due to the long study time.</p>

<p>The effective impact would reduce as a result of my ‚Äúpoor personal fit‚Äù
with being able to do an Econ PhD. When I input it <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uclRbujg4o9DTXxjVmwKU7-_lhe8AwQ7rQdIl3LhLzQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, I get a
value of 640 lives. Close to [6].</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [7] is [8].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is [7], [8]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Pursuing a tenure track will cut another<a href="https://80000hours.org/2013/10/the-value-of-economics-phds-a-conversation-with-robin-hanson/"> 7-11 years</a> from
your life where you can cause impact. Resulting in lower impact than
working in say MIT‚Äôs Poverty Action Lab. Assuming of course, that the
tenure track in academia will have the same impact as working at EAOs
~1k lives per 40 years of work.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [9] has [10].</p>

<p>I skip this, as 9 doesn‚Äôt make sense any more.</p>

<p><em>Really bad writing!</em></p>

<p><em>11 also skipped for similar reasons!</em></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>C&amp;Q</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Also, compared to (DS for DW)[1] this (career path is not good)[2],
looking at (personal fit)[3] as well as (impact)[4]. If I take up
this career, I see myself loosing up to (10 years from now)[5]
before finishing my PhD. There is a (very good chance)[6] that I
don‚Äôt make the (tenure track)[7] but still get into
(academia)[8]. This could easily (set me back another decade)[9]
before I (start my real contribution in academia)[10], (further
reducing the impact)[11].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: DS for DW &gt; Economics PhD considering [3].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: DS for DW <em>__</em> Economics PhD considering [3].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Based on the fact that I didn‚Äôt get top 20 for my masters
in the US, I think it is axiomatic that I don‚Äôt have credentials for
top 20 in Economics PhD. I probably need to spend 3-5 years working my
way up from ground 0 in economics before I am top 20 worthy.</p>

<p>Whereas with DS, I personally know several engineers who studied
similar to my degree, who went to DS after a masters.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, since I have 5 years before I make the official
jump to EAO, I have plenty of time to do Deliberate Practice and beef
up my statistics game. Hence I claim that Personal fit is ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù
for DS for DW than Economics PhD.</p>

<p>For [1], we think of working in DS in Google for 5 years, and then
moving to EAO‚Äôs like GiveWell.</p>

<p>For Econ PhD, we think of getting into the top 20 colleges to do a PhD</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: DS for DW &gt; Economics PhD considering impact</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: DS for DW <em>__</em> Economics PhD considering impact</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Based on <a href="http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html">Alleged Wisdom</a>, it appears that there is a
chance of making an impact as large as 400 lives once in your life. In
addition to this with a salary starting at 108k, it would in total be
possible to save <a href="http://agent18.github.io/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html">750 lives</a>.</p>

<p>With working an an EAO like GiveWell, it should be possible to save 1k
lives.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: It will take [5] before finishing PhD</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: It will take <em>__</em> before finishing PhD</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Based on <a href="https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/">this</a> the initial prepping for Economics PhD
will take 3 years atleast! <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/economics-phd/#what-is-this-career-path">An econ PhD takes 5-7 years</a>. In total
10 years.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: &lt;5% chance that I make [7]</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: <em>__</em> % chance that I make [7].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: *Unable to find any links that gives stats comparing
tenure and non-tenure.
*
<strong>Claim</strong>: &gt;50% chance that I go into [8].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: <em>__</em> % chance that I go into [8].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp6990.pdf">This</a> link suggests that academic positions were
&gt;55% of all the employments of Econ PhDs for 2012</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Lack of [7] leads to [9] before [10]</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Lack of [7], leads to <em>__</em> before [10].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>I only have Robin Hanson‚Äôs word for it! Also he does not
say that absence of tenure track is pointless to work, he only says
that if the research you need to do is not in the direction for
positive impact only then we may want to spend time to get tenure track</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Lack of [7] leads to [11]</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Lack of [7] leads to <em>__</em></p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: If I spend 10 years for studying, and another 10
years to get tenure track, I will have another 20 years to work. Where
as if I start with tenure track after 10 years of studying, then I
have 30 years of contribution still left.</p>

<p><em>I know this whole series above of [10] phrases is with no
proper examples. Only while I write this I see how I am lacking. Only
when someone asked me for examples am I thinking that maybe what I am

how hard it is to get tenure track, other than ‚Äúit is HARD‚Äù.</em></p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Peter works for a startup that makes credit models to

<h2 id="work-bm-with-springs26">Work: BM with springs(26)</h2>

<p><em>My GL did some cool work and sent it out to everybody. This being
related to control and dynamics, I had a hard time understanding
it. So I started to look at his claims one by one, started putting
numbers, cleared one by one and went all the way till the end to see
if they held water. In the end I had 2 questions and was able to
discuss with him on ‚Äúhis level‚Äù about what he had written and what my
questions were aka what I didn‚Äôt understand. I felt happy. Atleast as
soon as I started pulling some numbers from the text 50 N/mm
etc‚Ä¶ life started to become better. I need to do this on more and
more on more documents at work. The first time I read it, I knew I was
just reading labels. No understanding, because I didn‚Äôt paint a
picture in my head with #examples, I guess. Isolate and tackle and
identify what exactly you didn‚Äôt understand or so I thought!</em></p>

<p><img src="./images/images-DP-3/stage-damper.png" alt="stage-damper png" /></p>

<p><strong>Context for reader:</strong></p>

<p>The stage has coils and the balance mass has magnets in it. With
current in the coils it creates a force on the stage and the BM
(balance mass). The stage needs to move 150mm and the balance mass
which is 5 times as heavy will move only 30mm. Initially there were no
springs but motors to bring back the balance mass to the center, once
in 10 days (in case it drifted away). This was an investigation by
GL about this. And I had to understand what they were saying.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>C&amp;Q</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if we replace the Drift motors by simple springs with damping?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Consequence 1</strong>
Obvious: (Force)[1] will be exerted on the (outer frame)[2]. But the
(magnitude of this force)[3] is (small)[4]:(maximal the amount of
force needed by the balance mass motors)[5] otherwise. The (force)[6]
scales with the (displacement of the balance mass)[7], which is a
(double integrator of the applied force to the stage)[8]. (This
force)[9] thus only has (low frequent components)[10].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] is exerted on [2].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: <em>__</em> is exerted on [2] because of the presence of
springs.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: When the stage moves from 0 to 150mm to the right, the
balance mass moves 30mm to the left. This results in a spring
compression of 30mm. Assuming a stiffness of 50N per 30 mm (based on
another document), we see that there will be a force of 50N on the
frame.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [3] is [5].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [3] <em>__</em> [5].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The documentation suggests that with drift motors 50 N of
force will be on the frame and this is fine. With the spring of
stiffness 50N per 30mm, we should have the same force on the frame.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [3] is [4].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [3] is <em>__</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: [3] will be 50N force on the frame which is allowed when
using the drift motors and hence it shall be allowed when we use
springs. Hence it is ‚Äúsmall‚Äù aka acceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [6] increases with [7].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [6] increases, [7] _____</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: It is a spring, so this is expected. If the spring
compresses 30mm, then we have a force of 50 N. If the spring
compresses 15mm, then only a force of 25N is experienced on the outer
frame.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [6] increasing with [7], is [8].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [6] increasing with [7], <em>__</em> [8].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:  No idea what [8] means. <em>It is not my area</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Due to [8], [9] results in [10].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Due to [8], [9], results in <em>__</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: I don‚Äôt understand [8] yet, so not able to comment on
[10]. Also what is ‚Äúlow frequency‚Äù, I don‚Äôt know. I imagine it is
something that the controller can handle with ease based on its
‚Äúbandwidth‚Äù</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>C&amp;Q</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Consequence 2</strong>
Using (low spring constant)[1] keeps the BM in the (center of the
range)[2a] with a large (time constant)[2]. So even with the stage
at (one extreme position)[3], the balance mass will (move slowly
back to the center)[4]. (Moving the stage from that extreme position
to the opposite extreme position)[5] will result in( movement of the
Balance Mass twice the amount as when the stage would move from the
center to that same extreme position)[6]. So another consequence is:
(twice the movement range of the balance mass)[7] is (needed)[8].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] keeps BM in [2a] with large [2].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [1] keeps BM, in [2a] with <em>__</em> [2].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>For [1], we think about 50N per 30 mm. This brings the BM back to the
center in 1s (time constant). Is this large? I think it is. This
essentially will provide an oscillation of &lt;1Hz which can easily be
matched by a controller to keep the stage in the same position within
0.5um accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: If stage at [3], BM will [4].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: If stage at [3], the BM will <em>__</em> move back to center.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: When the stage is moved by 150mm from the center, the
balance mass will move by by 30mm. It will come back to 0 mm within
1s and will oscillate with &lt;1Hz. This is slow enough, for the
controller to keep the stage in the same position within 0.5um
accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [5], will result in [6].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [5] will result in <em>__</em></p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Moving the stage by 150mm takes it to the extreme
position with the BM moved by 30mm. We hold the stage there but the BM
drifts towards the center. Now when we want to move the Stage to
-150mm, then the BM will need to move -60mm.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [7] is needed.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [7] is <em>__</em></p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: With the drift motor there is space needed only to move
by 30 mm each side. Due to the springs added, we see in the above
example that we will ‚Äúneed‚Äù 2x BM movement. Well!</p>

<p>The 2x need not be necessary based on the actual scenarios. I do not
know the actual scenarios. If the stage stays at the extreme position
only for 0.1s, then the BM drifts 5mm in 0.1s. This means the BM will
need to move by 5 mm extra if the stage moves from one extreme to the
other, if the stage stays at the extreme position for &gt; 1s, then we
need 2x range for the BM for sure. For now we assume 2x is needed with
springs!</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>C&amp;Q</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Consequence 3</strong>
In case the (balance mass is combined with the motor Yoke (like it‚Äôs
the case for the XBeam)[1], the (extra range of movement needed for
the balance mass)[2] translates into the (requirement for a longer
Yoke)[3]. The (extra length needed equals)[4] the (extra movement
range of the balance mass)[5]. Taking (consequence 2 &amp; 3)[6a]
together, the (total extra space)[6] needed in order to( replace a
BM motor by a spring)[7] is 2x the (original movement range of the
BM)[8].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>:  if [1], [2] implies longer [3].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: if [1], [2] implies <em>__</em> [3].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The current yoke is such that there is 5mm before the
coil runs out of the magnets when the stage is in the extreme
position. This is used for tolerances like machining etc‚Ä¶ To
accommodate the spring-design we need +-60mm instead of +-30mm
(current). This means that the Yoke has to be increased by +- 30mm
(60mm total) atleast to ensure that the continuous force of the
actuator is constant (280N +- 1N) so that there are no ‚Äúproblems for
the controller‚Äù.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [4] == [5].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: [4] <em>__</em> [5].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: To accommodate the spring we need +-60mm instead of
+-30mm (current). This means that the Yoke has to be increased by 60mm
atleast to ensure that the continuous force of the actuator is 280N +-
1N so that there are no ‚Äúproblems for the controller‚Äù.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Considering [6a], [6] needed for [7], is 2x of [8].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Considering [6a], [6] needed for [7] is <em>__</em> of [8].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: As seen above we need +-60mm of BM travel. Currently we
have 30mm of BM travel. 60\/30 = 2</p>
