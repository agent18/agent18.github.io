<blockquote>
  <p>Mission #3: Design and execute a simple deliberate practice routine
for ‚Äúexpressing an idea clearly and systematically‚Äù using the Ben
Franklin method (as explained in the essay above). 100 input scenarios
should do the trick. Output dimensions would be (a) providing a
concrete example (like factorial(3) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 when teaching
someone about factorial), (b) stating the observations and hypotheses,
and (c) having the output of one sentence flow as the input of the
next sentence (e.g., data from my computer goes to my wireless router,
then from my wireless router to Google‚Äôs data center, and through
maybe a few more data centers, before it comes to your router, and
then to your computer). You are free to use more dimensions. The idea
is that you take a trouble ticket, make brief notes, later write your
version from the notes, compare to a better response using the output
dimensions, and try again. If other TT responses are unavailable, you
can work with articles that you think were written clearly. 1 week.</p>

<h2 id="the-benjamin-franklin-method">The Benjamin Franklin Method</h2>

<p>The book ‚ÄòTalent is Overrated‚Äô seems to suggest that greatness is not
only for a select few. In fact there exists a path that runs between
your current abilities to that of the greats. The journey will be
hard, long and demanding. Not many will follow it all the way till the
end. But if you do, you become something else entirely. So what is
this path?</p>

<p>In the book ‚ÄòTalent is Overrated‚Äô, the differences between people
proficient in a skill and people who are outright great is brought
out. The difference was about who did more ‚ÄòDeliberate Practice‚Äô
(DP). DP is not the same as practice; you know the kind where you hit
the golf ball 10000 times without measuring key output dimensions such
as distance covered, timing and accuracy. DP and its five elements are
mentioned in ‚ÄòTalent is Overrated‚Äô:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
examining. It is activity designed specifically to improve
performance, often with a teacher‚Äôs help; it can be repeated a lot;
feedback on results is continuously available; it‚Äôs highly demanding
mentally, whether the activity is purely intellectual, such as chess
or business-related activities, or heavily physical, such as sports;
and it isn‚Äôt much fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this theory is great but‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All theory and no actual practice makes STM‚Äôs and Agent‚Äôs dull boys</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, Let‚Äôs become great. For this we need to first start with designing
a DP routine.  Designing a DP routine for things like sports, music
and games, seems to be not too hard, especially considering all the
knowledge, technology and coaches available. For example, if you
consider a game like chess, the way to DP, is to compare what move you
would make in a particular position and compare that to the move of a
grandmaster; Of course this needs to be repeated way too many times on
millions of scenarios before you become GREAT. There are tons of books
and videos to practice from as well. For things like ‚Äúcritical
thinking‚Äù, ‚Äúlogical reasoning‚Äù it seems to be really hard to come up
with DP routines. I made an attempt <a href="/skills-deliberate-practice.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>It was hard as f*ck just to design DP workouts! But more concerning is
that I failed to meet the characteristics of DP. For example, look at
the characteristic, ‚ÄúFeedback on results is continuously
available‚Äù. In the design for ‚Äútraining to determine EE‚Äù, I never
really got to something where I would get continuous feedback. I was
suggesting in the design, to make a blog post out of a practice
session to get feedback. This would mean getting feedback a week later
and this doesn‚Äôt seem to be continuous feedback. Some other DP designs
were vague and I had no idea if it would work even. For example, the
one with ‚Äútraining to identify claims of EE‚Äù. I had suggested reading
news paper articles to determine if something had EE or not. I have no
idea if and how this is going to work, and what it would mean to have
EE and what it would mean to not. The other examples were like this as
well. In the end, it was hard, I didn‚Äôt really come up with much
useful things.</p>

<p>But then we have clear examples in the ‚ÄòTalent is Overrated‚Äô book on
how to DP. One such example was based on Benjamin Franklin (BF).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Benjamin Franklin was ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs first great man of letters‚Äù in the view
of David Hume and many others, so we might naturally wonder how
he came to be the extraordinary writer he was.</p>

  <p>‚Äî Talent is Overrated, Chapter 7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What he did to become who he was, was roughly like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, he found examples of prose clearly superior to anything he
could produce, a bound volume of the Spectator, the great English
periodical written by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. Any of us
might have done something similar. But Franklin then embarked on a
remarkable program that few of us would ever have thought of. It began
with his reading a Spectator article and making brief notes on the
meaning of each sentence; a few days later he would take up the notes
and try to express the meaning of each sentence in his own words. When
done, he compared his essay with the original, ‚Äúdiscovered some of my
faults, and corrected them.‚Äù</p>

  <p>‚Äî Chapter Seven, Talent is Overrated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An STM designed and executed a DP routine based on the BF method
<a href="http://pradeep90.github.io/ben-franklin-practice.html#fnref2">here</a>. In my case (according to the mission), I would need to get
into designing DP for ‚Äúexpressing an idea clearly and
systematically‚Äù. To emulate Benji‚Äôs method, some superior work (imho)
is to be used that ‚Äúexpresses an idea clearly and systematically‚Äù. So
you find the superior work. You then need to make minimal notes on
meaning conveyed a few sentences at a time, rewrite them in your own
words, and when done compare with the original. Observe how you and
the author of the superior work fare against a set of output
dimensions. Hitting 10k balls and not clearly understanding how to
compare each hit is useless. How do you compare? On what output
dimensions do you compare?  That is the precise question that will
provide feedback, like when you are under the Hogainagal waterfall,
instant and harsh. The blog written by an STM, captures this very well
and we will use that as our blueprint to design our DP.</p>

<p><a href="http://pradeep90.github.io/Revenge-or-Grow.html">‚ÄòRevenge or Grow‚Äô</a> I think is definitely one of the fine works by
an STM, much superior to my writing for sure. This essay I think has
communicated the idea about ‚Äòwhat to do when you are hurt
emotionally?‚Äô, really well. To this day I come back to read this
essay, to read the solution in times of need. The reasons and examples
used to pursue the reader to give up drama are very persuasive. They
are superior to anything I have come up with so far. I suspect I
couldn‚Äôt have come up with the solution by myself and hence my mighty
respect. I think as a direct consequence of this and experiencing what
the author expresses about drama, I try to remove drama from my life,
even if it means to swallow my pride and say sorry, because peace is
important, you want to focus on the bigger and more important battles
in life, and not f*cking how to get back at your colleague for some
lame attacks he made on you.</p>

<p>So the superior example is this article <a href="http://pradeep90.github.io/Revenge-or-Grow.html">‚ÄúRevenge or grow‚Äù</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="rewriting-in-my-own-words">Rewriting in my own words</h3>

<p>What is the best course of action when someone hurts you? and Why?</p>

<p>People might pick on you, make a lot of people laugh at everything
that you do, not stick up for you in a moment of need, randomly get
angry at you etc‚Ä¶ If you are like me then these things would hurt
you. And then you have two options, to make revenge or to grow.</p>

<p>Taking revenge is about providing some sort of punishment to the
person who wronged you. Say if he insulted you in front of everybody,
then you wait for the right moment and try to insult him back or
somehow seek the upper hand. But what if your revenge attempt fails?</p>

<p>Your life then starts to suck even more. Winning against someone
who has forever practiced only this, is going to be really hard, and
you might want to remember the times you failed when you engaged in
drama. Hmmm! So the way ahead seems to be to deliberately practice
attacking and get better at it. Is that it? Is this the whole picture?
Nope! What happens when someone wrongs you? Introducing, drama.</p>

<p>How do you feel when you are involved in a drama? You constantly think
about it, you are consumed by it. You think of ways of getting back at
the people who wronged you. You run scenarios in your mind where you
are verbally battling with them. You have other things to do, well too
bad, drama is still more important for your brain. If your colleague
came at you hard in front of everyone for a small mistake, drama
starts. The worst thing is you could be waiting for the next
opportunity to bring him down and the back and forth could last until
one of ya‚Äôll leave the company. So you would always need to be on your
guard, and all this for what? The great BRAIN is evolved for things
like this. It loves social battles, and it lives for things like
this. The Brain lives for it but doesn‚Äôt mean you should go along with
it.</p>

<p>So what is the alternative? Forgive, move on, get on with the
important things in your life. Don‚Äôt engage in drama. But how? The
next time you find yourself in a situation where people laugh at you,
smile and move on, despite all your instincts to retaliate. The next
time your colleague comes at you in anger for a really small mistake
you did in front of everyone -even though he has made similar
mistakes- swallow your pride, say sorry, move on. If this type of
drama extends in a few parts of your life, that is enough to give up
everything important to you. Drama is not worth engaging in due to the
consequences. It consumes you. It eats you alive. Someone gets to live
in your head rent free.</p>

<p>Whether you retaliate or not, people are going to come back for more,
for their own amusement. People are not going to magically change. But
in any case, engaging in drama decreases the quality of your life as
it consumes you and does not allow you to focus on important things in
your life. You need to realize that social life is not the only life
you have. Instead you could focus on creating value, enriching your
life. Work on important problems that need attentions, and gain the
respect from your work, play sports and get better at skills, instead of
by engaging in drama which is more like playing poker with High card.</p>

<h3 id="output-dimensions">Output dimensions</h3>

<p>This whole comparing thing is going to be really hard to come up with,
as we are talking about something so vague and subjective as
‚Äúexpressing an idea clearly and systematically. Instead of discovering
my own dimensions, I shall start with some output dimensions that an
STM has provided (in the mission) and get some more from
criticalthinking.org. I scanned the whole of <a href="criticalthinking.org">criticalthinking.org</a>
and along with STM‚Äôs suggestion (in the section ‚ÄòMission‚Äô) we have the
following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>state one point at a time</p>

    <p>This would mean to identify the main ideas amongst a set of
sentences or paragraphs. The main ideas will be delivered in series
i.e., first idea, explanation, followed by second idea, explanation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elaborate on what you mean</p>

    <p>The identified main ideas should be elaborated on with more than
 one sentence atleast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give example(s) that connect your thoughts to life experiences</p>

    <p>This is straight forward. Examples regarding the central idea
 connecting to life experiences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give analogies and metaphors to help people connect your ideas to
the things that they already understand (for example, critical
thinking is like an onion, the way you cut it will determine whether
your eyes bleed tears or not).</p>

    <p>Analogies and figures of speech shall be available atleast to
 communicate all the main ideas identified.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State the observations and hypothesis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have the output of one sentence flow into the other</p>

    <p>Each sentence should connect with the following sentence. What does
it mean? Words from one sentence are found in the second sentence?
A question is followed by an answer (unless rhetoric)?</p>

    <p>Not like this:</p>

    <p>‚ÄúBut what if your revenge attempt fails? Winning against someone
who has practiced this forever, is going to be really hard, and you
might want to remember the time you failed when you engaged in
drama.‚Äù</p>

    <p>The jump between the first and the second sentence is a lot. One
sentence does not flow into the other sentence. The second sentence
is long and has more than one point in it which makes it quite
confusing. The connection for those points is missing as
well. Instead,</p>

    <p>Maybe like this:</p>

    <p>‚ÄúBut what if your revenge attempt fails? Your life sucks even more
than it did when your colleague put you down. Imagine the times
when you failed after engaging in drama, how did you feel? How long
did you obsess over it?. We need to realize that there are always
going to be people (colleagues) who are better than us in
delivering snubs or hurting you, i.e., there is a good chance your
life is going to suck if you are engaging in drama. So, it appears
to be lost cause to pursue revenge, unless you engage in DP and get
extremely better at attacking as a result.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrelevant point should not be focused on</p>

    <p>Are there any deviations from the main focus
central idea of the essay? Are some questions that could be
answered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not miss any relevant points</p>

    <p>Did the author miss to investigate something or miss to consider
 other relevant points?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are assumptions justified?</p>

    <p>What are the assumptions and are they justified, if crucial?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which button do you press?</p>

  <p>The basic idea is simple. Someone pushes your buttons. They make you
feel low-status. Or they make fun of something you care deeply
about. Or they are deliberately non-compliant - they purposefully
refuse to do something you ask for even though you would have done

</blockquote>

<p>Rule #1: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">People get hurt by people who make fun of them</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the two
buttons</code> are the two main ideas. But I think an STM does not deliver
them serially, i.e., one point at a time. The first point is delivered
and then the next, followed by some discussion of the first point
again. It looks a bit repetitive coming to think of it. I think I
stuck to delivering the two ideas serially in this case. 0-1 for
Agent.</p>

<p>Rule #2: I think both of us elaborate on the first main idea <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">People
get hurt ...</code>. For the second point most of the info is expected to be
delivered in the coming sections. Something that I didn‚Äôt do is, I
didn‚Äôt really expand on this word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grow</code>, whereas an STM does, with
‚Äúignoring the injury and grow‚Äù. This word needs some explanation as
there is not much context yet. Strike for me I guess.  1-0 for STM.</p>

<p>Rule #3: I think an STM and I do enough, by delivering atleast 2-3
examples to express the main idea. 1-1.</p>

<p>Rule #4: I think an STM used 3 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metaphors</code> with ‚Äúhit you where it
hurts‚Äù, ‚Äúpushing your buttons‚Äù &amp; ‚ÄúYou have two buttons in front of
you‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think I do have any analogies or metaphors even, to
convey the points better. 1-0.</p>

<p>Rule #5: The whole essay by an STM does not seem to have an
observation-hypothesis paradigm, and mine doesn‚Äôt either. 0-0</p>

<p>I am not able to imagine what an observation-hypothesis paradigm of
explanation would look like for the above case or for that matter this
whole essay.</p>

<p>Rule #6: Output of one sentence flows into the other until the second
main idea is stumbled on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or they hit you where they know it hurts.</p>

  <p>You have two buttons in front of you:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I think this rule expects is a segue. Something like the
following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or they hit you where they know it hurts. <em>So, what do you do?</em>
You have two buttons in front of you:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my case, it seems to be in flow. 0-1 Agent</p>

<p>Rule #7: I think both STM and I stick to not saying anything that is
not relevant to the central point of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getting hurt</code>. 1-1</p>

<p>Rule #8: I don‚Äôt think any relevant points are missed. 1-1</p>

<p>Rule #9: Are there any assumptions that are crucial? Is ‚Äúthere are two
buttons‚Äù an assumption? Is this crucial? I am not sure of what is
expected with this ‚Äúassumption‚Äù rule, as criticalthinking.org routinely

<p>Rule #1: The main points seem to be, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what happens if revenge goes
wrong</code> , <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what happens if revenge goes right</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the need to
practice social attacks</code>. I do not think each point is delivered one at
a time by an STM. An STM has delivered the line ‚ÄúWhat could possibly
go wrong if you press the revenge button?‚Äù as part of the first point,
but then he immediately moves on to the next main idea <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what happens
if revenge goes right</code>, and comes back to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what happens if revenge
goes wrong</code>. This does not seem to be delivering one point at a

<p>Rule #2: I think both elaborate enough on the main points. 1-1</p>

<p>Rule #3: I have failed to deliver any examples unlike an STM, who gave

strike for me. 1-0</p>

<p>Rule #5: I don‚Äôt think any observations and hypotheses are considered
here by both. 0-0</p>

<p>Rule #6: There seems to be good flow from one sentence/paragraph to
the other, in the form of rhetoric questions in STM‚Äôs case, for most
of the section. As pointed in the discussion of Rule #1, an STM seems
to have gone back and forth with the first two main points. This
automatically seems to violate this rule as well. Looking at the two
sentences in isolation seems to confirm the Strike for STM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What could possibly go wrong if you press the Revenge button? Sure,
you get the joy of being vindicated.</p>

<p>In my case, the flow seems to be really off. I go from ‚ÄúYour life then
starts to suck even more.‚Äù to ‚ÄúWinning against someone who has forever
practiced only this, ‚Ä¶‚Äù. There is nothing inbetween that connects
these two sentences. Instead I think it would be better if I said
something like the following, to ensure flow:</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut what if your revenge attempt fails? Your life then starts to suck
even more. Unless you are like the Queen Bee or Mr. popular, the
chances of your revenge failing (i.e., life sucking even more) is
quite high. So the way ahead seems to be to deliberately practice
attacking and getting better at it. Is that it? Is this the whole
picture? ‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<p>0.5-0</p>

<p>Rule #7: I don‚Äôt think anything said by both an STM and I was
irrelevant. 1-1</p>

<p>Rule #8: I never really explicitly considered what it would mean to
win a revenge attempt. I missed that. Although the value in this case
might not be much, it looks like it is a pitfall. I should talk about
all cases, not wave it off with my hand. Strike! 1-0</p>

<p>Rule #9: ‚ÄúThe most popular members of any social network have
fine-tuned the art of cutting a person to pieces‚Äù, is an assumption
from an STM‚Äôs side. This assumption is not crucial, other than for
delivering the point. Anecdotal evidence would suggest as an STM
says. This rule has not really been clear to me from the beginning,
should I flag every assumption? I think this assumption doesn‚Äôt need
any justification. More on this on the section on reflection.</p>

it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule #1: So the main points of this section seems to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consumption
in drama</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brain being evolved for the social world</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actual
impact of engaging in drama</code>. It looks like an STM seems to talk about
one point at a time. For me, I seem to be talking about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actual
impact of engaging in drama</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brain being evolved for the social
world</code>. But I think I violated this rule. I initially talk about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the
actual impact of engaging in drama</code>, but suddenly for like a sentence
I go to the next main point and then come back to the first point. How
much the drama means to the brain, seems to be related to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brain being
evolved for social world</code>. The changed version below (change shown in
the form of strike-through) should pass rule #1.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶ You run scenarios in your mind where you are verbally battling
with them. You have other things to do, well too bad, drama is still
going to consume you. <del>well too bad, drama is still more important

</blockquote>

<p>Strike! 1-0</p>

<p>Rule #2: I just started off with this word called drama. What is meant
by it is not clear. Other wise it looks fine for both of us. It is
still a Strike for half a point atleast. 1-0.5</p>

<p>Rule #3: I think both of us have enough examples. 1-1</p>

<p>Rule #4: Analogies, for sure an STM has given. ‚ÄúYour mind is like MS
Dhoni in the last five overs of a cricket match. This is what it lives
for.‚Äù, Epic! Indeed I have never thought of writing or explaining
things in this dimension until it was explicitly brought to my notice
recently. Hopefully in the coming articles. 1-0</p>

<p>Rule  #5: It is more like a question answer session rather than a
observation, hypothesis paradigm. Same with me. More like conclusions
as a result of observations. I am continuing to not be sure if this
framework might work for this type of essay. 0-0</p>

<p>Rule #6:</p>

<p>It looks ok, but I see that I might have combined or introduced
randomly the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù in this sentence ‚ÄúYou have other things to do,
well too bad, drama is still more important for your brain.‚Äù. I read
this para a few times and felt it slightly all over the place as
well. Whereas when I read an STM‚Äôs delivery it seemed to be much
better.</p>

<p>I think one flaw in the flow is that I don‚Äôt keep the two
central ideas discussed separate, i.e., I deliver that ‚Äúdrama is still
more important for your brain‚Äù right in the middle of the first main
idea.  And I don‚Äôt do anything more with it, until a few sentences
later. Messing up the first rule seems to automatically mess up this
rule.</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed is that I want to inform the audience
that engaging in drama takes a lot of your time and f*cks up important
things with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The worst thing is you could be waiting for the next opportunity to
bring him down and the back and forth could last until one of ya‚Äôll
leave the company</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started abruptly by delivering the example, and I didn‚Äôt take it
much further. Instead I moved on to the next point. The flow was hence
missing or the connections were missing between multiple sentences. I
would like to rewrite the passage focusing on flow. This is done below
with some comments in the brackets:</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you feel when you are involved in a drama? You constantly
think about it, you are consumed by it. You think of ways of getting
back at the people who wronged you. You run scenarios in your mind
where you are verbally battling with them. You have other things to
do? Well! too bad, drama will still win (removed ‚Äúdrama is still
important for the brain‚Äù which did not fit here). Drama doesn‚Äôt stop
when you want, in fact, it goes on and on for a long time (drama and
time elaborated). For example, your colleague comes at you hard in
front of everyone for a small mistake you did, thus initiating
drama. You try to get back at him, and then he tries to get back at
you (filler sentence added which seemed to be missing!). This goes on
until one of ya‚Äôll leave the company. Sometimes you tend to think
about how someone has wronged you for weeks. As I am working on this
document, there still comes in flashes an incident of drama that
happened <em>4 weeks ago</em>. I think about how a one asshole screwed me
(Notice the anger, Notice the drama). Even yesterday after 4 weeks of
the incident I still talk about it, I still think about it. I try to
avoid it in most cases, but it is hard.</p>

<p>The great BRAIN seems to love this kind of shit. It obsesses over
this. Apparently it is evolved to thrive in social environments and
hence it craves for drama. It wants drama to be the single most
important thought in your head. This is NOT GOOD, especially when the
STM‚Äôs and AGENT‚Äôs have much much bigger things to deal with. The Brain
loves it, but does that mean you should give up everything important
to you to satisfy it, i.e., engage in drama?‚Äù</p>

<p>1-0</p>

<p>Rule #7: Points discussed don‚Äôt seem to be irrelevant. 1-1</p>

<p>Rule #8: I didn‚Äôt mention in my part of the essay something that an
STM mentioned. It is about how your brain tries to convince you, ‚ÄúYour
mind will defend itself by saying that it is just about
deterrence. Like, you know, hitting the baddies hard‚Äù. I think this is
important as this is a relevant mechanism that the brain might try to
trick you into believing. One that I need to be aware of and hence
should have been in my version of the article. 1-0</p>

<p>Rule #9: Skip!</p>

<p>Score: 7-2.5 on 9</p>

<p>Quick P.S</p>

<p>This is quite exhausting. Finishing a few paragraphs of 9 dimensions
OMG, it is painful! How am I going to pull off 3 more hrs of this? 1
hr and 40 mins and am already knackered!</p>

<p>STM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The High Road What is the alternative? Seriously, what else could
you possibly do but avenge the hurt? They have (apparently)
decreased the quality of your life significantly. Unless you hit
them back, this is gonna happen again and again, and your quality of
life (it feels) will go down with every blow.</p>

  <p>How the hell can you think of doing anything but punish the guy who
caused you so much pain? If you don‚Äôt retaliate in some way, would
they not keep taking advantage of you like this? Won‚Äôt you just
drown in the shower of hurts? But then, we saw that even if you seek
to punish others socially, your peace of mind will still take a hit.</p>

  <p>Could we choose to take the high road and just ignore it?</p>

  <p>‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶‚Äù, you splutter.</p>

  <p>Yes, I know. They‚Äôll keep attacking, keep making you feel bad, keep
making your life worse. Yes, it‚Äôs not in human nature to
notice when you‚Äôre destroying everything precious to a person by
abusing the fact that you‚Äôre in a position of higher social
status.</p>

  <p>People who have made fun of you in the past and abused you in every
way possible are not magically going to change tomorrow and tell you
that they shouldn‚Äôt have done all that.</p>

  <p>Ain‚Äôt gonna happen. The best you can hope for, if you pluck up the
courage open up to them, is - ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ we were just doing it for fun,
man. Why you taking it so seriously?‚Äù</p>

  <p>So, yeah, I‚Äôm well aware of that. And I still suggest letting it slide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ME:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what is the alternative? Forgive, move on, get on with the
important things in your life. Don‚Äôt engage in drama. But how? The
next time you find yourself in a situation where people laugh at you,
smile and move on, despite all your instincts to retaliate. The next
time your colleague comes at you in anger for a really small mistake
you did in front of everyone -even though he has made similar
mistakes- swallow your pride, say sorry, move on. If this type of
drama extends in a few parts of your life, that is enough to give up
everything important to you. Drama is not worth engaging in due to the
consequences. It consumes you. It eats you alive. Someone gets to live
in your head rent free.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you retaliate or not, people are going to come back for more,
for their own amusement. People are not going to magically change. But
in any case, engaging in drama decreases the quality of your life as
it consumes you and does not allow you to focus on important things in
your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule #1: The difficulty in picking out the main points seems to be
note-worthy. An STM seems to start with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rhetoric questions on taking
revenge being the way to go despite everything</code> followed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reason
for taking the high road</code> and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">people are not going to change</code>. I
cannot believe that I can actually split some thing into a few clear
ideas in series. I have the same similar main points as well and in
series. 1-1</p>

<p>Rule #2: It looks like I should have clarified more about what I mean
with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">people are not going to change</code>, the second idea. I just have a
sentence on it. It‚Äôs a strike boys. 1-0</p>

<p>I think I would change the text related to the second idea i.e., the
second paragraph with some elaboration based on an STM‚Äôs
text. ‚ÄúWhether you retaliate or not, people are going to come back for
more, for their own amusement. If people hurt you in the past, you
cannot expect them to magically change. Even if you open up to them,
all you will get is a lousy ‚Äúhey we were just doing it for fun, why
are you taking it so seriously?‚Äù. These people who are higher in
social-status than us, don‚Äôt seem to understand this pain, and there
seems to be not much evidence that this would ever change, based on
several interactions I have had.‚Äù</p>

<p>Rule #3: Actually an STM doesn‚Äôt give examples for the idea of what
could be the alternative i.e., what is an example of ‚Äútake the high
road and just ignore it‚Äù. Whereas I do. For the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">people will not
change</code> point , an STM seems to have given good examples, whereas I
barely even said anything about it. 0.5-0.5</p>

<p>Rule #4: An STM seems to be engaging in quite some rhetorical
questioning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>which is a device used to persuade or subtly influence the
audience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This he has done in other sections as well, along with figures of
speeches and analogies. 0.5 extra for the rhetoric questioning.</p>

<p>Metaphors and other figures of speeches (FOS) indeed by an STM: ‚Äúwon‚Äôt you
just drown in the shower of hurts?‚Äù, ‚Äúpeace of mind will take a hit‚Äù,
while delivering the rhetoric questions. Surprisingly, it looks like I
have used some FOS‚Äôs as well: ‚ÄúIt(drama) eats you alive‚Äù, ‚Äúsomeone
gets to live in your head, rent free‚Äù, ‚Äúswallow your pride‚Äù. 1.5-1</p>

<p>Rule #5: Ya not sure here as well about observations and
hypothesis. Skip!</p>

<p>Rule #6: For me there seem to be some strikes: After delivering the
example about how to deal with my colleague I say ‚Äúif this type of
drama‚Äù. What type of drama am I talking about when the previous
sentence seems to talk about reducing drama. Strike!</p>

<p>If you look at my two paragraphs, it appears like there is a jump in
flow. But if you look at an STM‚Äôs delivery, there is a neat segue
(‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ you splutter‚Äù) as shown below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could we choose to take the high road and just ignore it?</p>

  <p><em>‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶‚Äù, you splutter.</em></p>

  <p>Yes, I know. They‚Äôll keep attacking,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think because of that it flowed like a water fall.</p>

<p>1-0</p>

<p>How I would re-write (with some comments in the brackets) is as below:</p>

<p>‚ÄúSo what is the alternative? Forgive, move on, get on with the
important things in your life‚Ä¶ The next time your colleague comes at
you in anger for a really small mistake you did in front of everyone
-even though he has made similar mistakes- swallow your pride, say
sorry, move on‚Ä¶ (the change begins here) But isn‚Äôt this going to
allow him to think he is right? Isn‚Äôt this going to set the tone for
future conversations? Isn‚Äôt this going to give him permission to keep
riding on you whenever he wants, for his amusement?</p>

<p>Yes, he probably will come at you more often even. If people hurt you
in the past, you cannot expect them to magically change. Even if you
open up to them, all you will get is a lousy ‚Äúhey we were just doing
it for fun, why are you taking it so seriously?‚Äù. These people who are
higher in social-status than us, don‚Äôt seem to understand this pain,
and there seems to be not much evidence that this would ever
change. So, people are not going to magically stop their hurting. Is
it still a good idea to let it slide?‚Äù</p>

<p>Rule #7: Don‚Äôt think anything irrelevant was written by both of us. 1-1</p>

<p>Rule #8: I am not sure if we are failing to consider any relevant
points yet. 0-0</p>

<p>Rule #9: SKIP.</p>

<p>Score: 6-3.5 on 9</p>

<p>Just couldn‚Äôt continue. Went limp! Needed to sleep for half hour! I
tried to continue and force myself, but I just couldn‚Äôt.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<!-- Conclusion on the essay -->

<p>Clearly an STM‚Äôs article was much better by feeling as well as
according to the Scores at the end of each piece. My highest was 5 and
that of an STM was a record 7. This way of working looks like a start
unlike my previous attempts. This was hard and exhausting no
doubt. The painful parts seem to be to figure out what the dimensions
mean and checking if those dimensions were met. Most of the times
checking this would mean that a piece had to be read atleast a few
times in full concentration. For example, for the first rule ‚Äúone idea
at a time‚Äù, I typically read some pieces 3-4 times. And everytime I
iterated (3x times with this essay) I had a slightly different
interpretation.</p>

<p>The method I used currently where I made notes as I saw fit, and wrote
the essay 2 days after making the notes, seems to be enough for
now. The bigger problems seem to be the dimensions. Discovering them
as well as understanding them, and identifying if the rules were met or
not, seems to be the hard part.</p>

<p>For sure there are better dimensions to be discovered than the ones I
have. Looking at the greats and identifying output dimensions or
refining my output dimensions could surely be a method. I could even
look online for more resources on dimensions. Somehow I found
criticalthinking.org, the website that clearly knows the importance of
examples, lacking it majorly. It was just theory being delivered one
after another. Imagine a dry subject such as ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù,
with no examples.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-on-each-dimension">Reflection on each dimension</h3>

<!-- This that were not clear but became clear over time -->
<p><strong>Rule #1: One idea at a time</strong></p>

<p>I had quite some doubts about my output dimensions, and had to refine
them over time, to allow myself to identify something reliably. For
example, the dimension initially was ‚Äústate one point at a time‚Äù. What
the hell is time? It took me a few sections, before I could catch on
to how vague it was. Then I moved on to ‚Äúone idea per paragraph‚Äù, in
an attempt to have something concrete. Then I moved to ‚Äúone idea over
a few paragraphs, where I see no overlap of another idea‚Äù. Still
vague, but much better than the beginning. In hindsight, for making a
rule concrete, I could have made a hypothesis of a rule and tested it
out on the best essays I know. But with this article I was focusing on
getting the work done. Determining the output dimensions more
seriously would have taken more time I think. This also applies to the
other dimensions.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #2: Elaboration</strong></p>

<p>I made up my own definition to allow myself to reliably identify
it. The definition being that there was &gt;1 sentence on the main idea,
just so that I could identify something concrete. Maybe it is not the
best, but it is a start.</p>

<!-- Things that I was cluless -->

<p><strong>Rule #3: examples</strong></p>

<p>I think this was easy from the get go. I don‚Äôt know if I did justice
in evaluation. I think from the next time that I should focus and be
clear that only the main ideas need examples and I should try to
segregate them per main idea.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #4: analogies and figures of speech</strong></p>

<p>Somethings I think I missed or was too lazy to refine: Should every
main idea have both analogies and figures of speech? Are figures of
speech important or do we just care about Metaphors?</p>

<p><strong>Rule #5: Observation-hypothesis</strong></p>

<p>This one is a tough one. Say you are explaining a how a computer works
or how a bicycle works. How is it possible to deliver this in a
hypothesis-observation framework. I want to conclude for now that the
observation-hypothesis framework might not work in this case while
explaining a concept such as ‚ÄòRevenge or Grow‚Äô. I need to look at few
other essays and work this out.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #6: flow</strong></p>

<p>The definition used till the end is vague. I seem to be checking if
one sentence connects with the next sentence. What does that mean
‚Äúobjectively‚Äù. Most times sentences are not written like, ‚Äú Jack and
Jill went up the hill, jack came down and who is left?‚Äù. The
complexity arises when looking at the delivery of the sentences. So
most of the time, I see, if there are proper segues or if the next
sentence seems to build off, or answer something posed in the current
sentence. Still vague I think.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #7: irrelevance</strong></p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think I identified even one point that was irrelevant. That is
a flag already. I need to work on this. I think by the time I came to
rule #7 I was exhausted that I didn‚Äôt want to spend time understanding
more about it or deliberating over it.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #8: Missing other Relevant points</strong></p>

<p>To be honest I think what I said for the last rule applies here as
well. I didn‚Äôt quite put effort in it, unless something said by an STM
was missing in my article.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #9: Assumptions</strong></p>

<p>What assumptions to circle out and what does it mean to have
assumptions justified, was not clear and no useful work was done with
this dimension. Sometimes I tried and gave up abruptly.</p>

<!-- I feel awkward trying to avoid say things without an example. I sort -->
<!-- of feel people would not understand it. I suspect it is a recent -->
<!-- thing. Look into older articles to see this show up.Giving an example -->
<!-- if good for me as weel as the reader. -->

<h2 id="final-remarks">Final Remarks</h2>

<p>This is probably what DP looks like.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This was actively designed to get better at something. The 9 output
dimensions are the parameters that help us gauge how good or bad we
are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be repeated a lot. There are great articles out there, of
Eliezer, PG and an STM, which I could use to perform the same BF
method on one dimension at a time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Feedback on results is continuously available. The feedback was
available right from the beginning. The output dimension
measurements are probably not too accurate, but this is a start and
there are ways to make the dimensions better. For all dimensions,
when the intention of the definition is not clear, I could draw a
few hypothesis and test it on the articles of the greats to
determine what exactly it could be. This way I could fine tune and
discover dimensions of value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is highly demanding. Well, I remember the day when I started
writing it all out. After around 2 hrs I just couldn‚Äôt. I tapped
out!</p>

    <p>Identifying dimensions and understanding them was one of the main
issues. Also, as mentioned by an STM in his DP of the BF method, DP is
usually looking at one aspect of the skill and training it. 9 output
dimensions seemed like an overkill to do all together. Maybe that was
one of the reasons for how mentally drained I felt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It isn‚Äôt much fun. Yep.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrast that to just writing one 3,000-word essay and calling that
practice ‚Äî STM</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>To be continued‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>P.S</strong></p>

<p>My version took: 2 and half hours to write and iterate after having
made notes 2 days back.</p>

<p>Went over the parts sections of DP 3 times in total. I would think
roughly 2.5 hrs in total for each section</p>

<p>Average time: ~4 hrs per day (for 7 days).
