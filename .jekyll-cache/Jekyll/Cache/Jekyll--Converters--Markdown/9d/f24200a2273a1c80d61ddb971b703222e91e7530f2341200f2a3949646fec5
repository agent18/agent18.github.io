<p>In the essay <a href="/purpose-of-life-continued.html">What is the purpose of life (2)</a>, it became clearer that feelings cannot be trusted selectively, to determine the true value system. However I thought I had landed on a gold mine when I realized that Biases could be the only clue, connecting us to our value system.
