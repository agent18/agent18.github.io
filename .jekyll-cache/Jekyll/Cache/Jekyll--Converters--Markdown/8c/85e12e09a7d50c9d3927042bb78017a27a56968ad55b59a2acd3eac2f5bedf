<h4 id="conflicting-views">Conflicting views</h4>

<p>Everytime I watch a PETA video or a video from allepo about the disastrous state the world is in, especially and most likely only ones where people are getting injured, such that the emotional quotient is high for me, I cry. I weep like a bitch. This is approximately 0.0000001% of my time in a day when I happen to, by chance come across a video with such characteristics. But everytime it happens, it bites me to bits, and lasts only for a few seconds after. After that, I am mostly just working, getting paid for that work. I come back home from work, wonder what I am doing in life, while I watch other people hanging out with women and friends, while I just go home and not be a part of such “Cool” activities. I feel sad :(.</p>

<p>On other days, there is gym, Man what a place to be. There is sports, Man this is life etc…</p>

<p>Another day, you watch some [not-so-random guy come on the tube][martin] and talk about [happiology][martin_ted], and says most  activities we do are pleasurable, only activities that give you meaning and activities that focus on your doing something bigger than you will get you lasting happiness. Things like say, being in the “service of GOD”, or being in the servitude for people (BATMAN, Gandhi), or the like. You mull this over, maybe this is what you want to do and then what happens? Back to the fucking grind.</p>

<p>Another day, you see a video by [Peter singer][] and then weep your fucking balls off, shocked at the extent to which people are willing to go to save people they have no idea about and you share that video with friends. “And then?” you ask? Well, Back to the fucking grind.</p>

<p>So can we come to a consensus that it is really unclear <strong>what I want to do</strong>. But somehow I end up doing the same thing over and over again. I cry, don’t take action, just sit around and wonder whats the use of all this?</p>

<p>Should I maybe do something about it?</p>

<p>Get to the bottom of it maybe</p>

<p>Well!</p>
<h4 id="design-rules-connecting-the-value-system-to-reality">Design rules connecting the value system to “reality”</h4>

<p>We have a true value system, and a set of design rules, that help us compute the reality cheaply[[Citation needed][]]. The brain can be imagined as a computer with a ram and storage. Given an infinite ram (computational capability) within an infinitely large storage, it should be  possible to compute what will happen at a given moment in the future in this world, based upon physics of the universe and an initial condition. But we don’t have such infinite ram to make those costly but True computations. In an attempt to bypass such complex computations, in a “conservative manner”, we have some design rules.</p>

<p>When designing machines, we use rules of thumb. This is primarily to increase speed at which designs are done, without loosing too much cost. For example, if we have a thread, the mating surface will automatically have 0.5mm diameter higher hole than the thread diameter. As designers we don’t need to every time, spend resources on deciding what type of mating-hole diameter we should use. By doing this, there is literally no increase in costs at all. We just save a lot of man hrs. Similarly, within our body, we have such rules of thumb (design rules); ‘Sugar Urge’ and ‘Social proof’ are some of them.</p>

<p>Sugary foods such as apples, oranges and other fruits are rich in vitamins. Instead of making calculations into the future regarding availability of fruits, the evolution just decided to keep a very high threshold on sugary products, as there was <a href="http://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/1025709/your-body-on-sugar-cravings">no way of overeating it in the bygone days</a>.<!-- The design rules were made in the stone age and haven't been updated to be relevant in the recent times[[Citation needed][]]. If we strictly listen to our urge and eat a lot donuts as a result we are sure to have [problems][sugar]. --></p>

<p>Another example of design rule is social proof.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Social proof, also known as informational social influence, is a psychological phenomenon where people assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior for a given situation. This effect is prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate mode of behavior, and is driven by the assumption that surrounding people possess more knowledge about the situation.  <br />
-[Wikipedia][]</p>

<!--If you look at the festival of Deewali in India, it feels great to participate in bursting crackers, only when everyone else is bursting crackers, not a month earlier or later for example. In a football stadium it feels great to chant stuff not just by yourself, but when others several others do it, and you do it along with them.

<h4 id="wants">Wants</h4>

<p>Wants seem to be divided into things that are primal, secondary, tertiary and so on. Primary wants would be, ‘I want food’, ‘I want girlfriends’, ‘I want a social life’, ‘I want to keep warm’, ‘I want my people to live’, ‘I want to live’ and the like…</p>

<p>Based on these, there are the secondary and tertiary wants so to naively speak, such as : wanting toned abs, wanting tasty foods, wanting a cool social cirlce, wanting hip clothes, wanting the latest IPAD, Mercedes etc. This we call for now as secondary wants as they are based on primary wants.</p>

<p>We want some wants more than others. These wants, also vary based on other factors and as a result change with time. Like for example, <strong>NOW</strong> I see there is a sick want to get girlfriends. But <strong>if I am in a situation</strong> where there is one person dying and I need to give up the only time I actually get laid in my life, well I guess I would. It seems not too hard to imagine someone keeping a person at gunpoint, and threatening you to give up your 60k TV that you just bought, so you can save this mans life. Will you do it? Of course you will. But, there are people metaphorically being kept at gunpoint by yamadeva and yet we don’t do anything to save them. It’s just a fucking TV. If someone claims that I am doing it because of social pressure, then what if this person is at gun point and no one will know, would you want to save him or not.</p>

<p>The real question is what do we want to do, owing to our vascillatory nature. It is clear there is no consistancy.Where do we go from here?</p>

<p>Summary is that what we want seems to be circular, now what?</p>

<p>So we seem to want some wants more than others. Like for example, we can don’t mind giving up a 60k Television when someone is held at gunpoint.</p>

<p>I would like to figure out what I should be doing. If I should</p>

<p>REASONING:</p>

<p>1) The first option would be to fully listen only to feelings.</p>

<p>This already feels obviously filled with issues</p>

<p>Am I saying that I will follow feelings and only feelings?</p>

<p>Doesn’t look like it. I don’t want to fall for shit, propaganda and the like.</p>

<p>What is this middle ground that you talk about?</p>

<p>Confirmation bias - god - get out</p>

<p>2) I can say Fuck this, I will not bow to anyone’s agenda, even though it might be what “I” seem to be hardwired with. I will do the complete opposite!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ Why should I listen to this agenda?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>3) I can say fuck this, I will just kill myself, it’s just too much.</p>

<p>4) I can choose to go behind my true value system, assuming I am able to find it out, using this flawed brain, and hold myself to its stringent requirements whether or not I feel like it.</p>

<p>5)</p>

<p>Connect this to the solution in my head!</p>

<p>If everything your brain spits out is wrong, how do you go about anything, Occums razor, snow is white becasue it is white… The simple truth</p>

<p>Now the question is should I go behind my feelings, the inconsistant bastards, or do I do something else?</p>

<p>Doing something else could mean,</p>

<h4 id="being-consistant">Being Consistant</h4>
<p>My point is I feel like I need to be consisitant. In my goals to become successful, get more girls and so on, my feelings are not going to be a 100% there with me while I make decisions. For example, I might have to decide between company A and B based on its merits, If I continue to use my limited feelings, I will not get to the goal. Somedays, I might want to sleep early, but will have so much work to do. Here tit would be disastrous to sleep. What should I do, use my limited feelings to get me out of issues? to assume that I will make the best decision whether I use feelings or not.</p>

<p>Or when we have conflicting feelings how do we resolve them.. Feelings such as having to go to sleep big time, but then using the mind and calculating that it will be a disastor to sleep.</p>

<h4 id="looking-at-biases">Looking at biases</h4>

<p>Visually has more value, so what that you are not there?</p>

<h4 id="the-three-options">the three options?</h4>

<p>It appears that there are 3 options.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Why promote the agenda of some value system?</li>
  <li>Why do everything that a particular value system wants?</li>
  <li>Why not just do what ever we are doing now? This would mean, I don’t know hwat this would mean.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="3-options">3 Options</h4>

<p>Feelings as intuitions being right?</p>

<h4 id="value-system-and-reality">Value system and reality</h4>

<p>I define value system as what I truely want, such as wanting a girlfriend, wanting people to live. The fundamental values that makes me human.</p>

<p>I define reality as the truth. The true value system is a subset of this reality.</p>

<hr />

<p>Currently, what I observe is that I want somethings more than others. I FEEL. I want a girlfriend more than I want to save millions of people. Say you want sugarry food that makes you fat and then you also want toned abs. You want these both, but are not able to control those sugar urges. They be too strong.But what should I do? It seems rather straight forward, that I should sacrifice the foods. Be a little strong and workout and get those packs of abs. Eating sugar seems like a temporary pleasure, as opposed to getting toned abs which will probably give pleasure by way of looks (atleast that is what I beleive) at a later stage. At this moment I anticipate that life will be better with toned abs. But I could be wrong, just like how I am wrong in many things, my reasoning is based on something that comes from me internally.</p>

<p>It feels like toned abs is  more important. To clarify that statement, It is my belief that toned abs are great to get women. It doesn’t matter, that not all the people in the world have toned abs and yet they have girlfriends, no I will stick to this, that it increasses the probability of my getting laid and being uber confident.</p>

<p>I see I have some things that I want more than others. as pointed above with the sugary food vs toned abs. This seems to come internally out of the belief I guess that it will get me girls. In a normal human standpoint, this would mean to just go with the flow, spend a lot of time in the gym (~2 years of work) and then finally the babes start landing left right and centre right?</p>

<p>How do you know your belief is right? In [Map vs Territory][] we saw that several of our beleiefs are wrong. We cant trust the reasoning. Assuming what we wnat is what we want, the way to get to where we want to be, seems almost bull.</p>

<p>So having written so much shit about shit. I slowly start discovering more about myself, or more about the problem. Hail PG. i.e., Keep writing.</p>

<p>Anyways, To start over again…</p>

<p>It appears that I have wants, some more than others, and then there is the way to get there also there is the reasoning for having those wants. Sugarry food vs toned abs getting girls example. The way to get to maximizing getting girls for example, might not be toned abs, <em>Insert Evidence here</em>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I am not able to decide. Lets say there is someone dying to my right and I have to give up 1000 rs to save them, as opposed to fucking my girlfriend. I strongly feel to save them. That its a stupid lay and that this is more important. Allah jaane allah jaaane!</p>

<p>Is this it,…. the reaonsing…. I for now see that I have wnats. I try to set tradeoffs and discover what I want… How to get to a want is an obvious fallacy… detailedin [Map vs Territory][]</p>

<h4 id="one-has-to-be-an-extremist">One has to be an Extremist</h4>

<p>One has to be an extremist in whatever path he chooses to pursue. For example, it doesn’t make sense when one uses science for some things and then religion for others. These are both suggesting contradictory view points. They never go hand in hand. Why I am saying this is because, it appears that I can either go the way I am going, i.e., listen to feelings in a [pleasurable activities sense][] or reflect on every belief that I have, make strong evaluations on them, using an evidence based protocol, and do what needs to be done. I recognize that my feelings are vacillating over the same topic at different points of time. Whenever I need to make a decision on the future, of course, I can say I believe in X and X will be the best place for me in life. Or I can evaluate, based on things that I seem to want</p>
