<h2 id="jan-4-2021">jan 4 2021</h2>

<p>I have a grim image about my health.</p>

<p>I used to climb once a week 2 times chest and legs and one time run
and walk most daysâ€¦</p>

<p>Stopped climbingâ€¦ as it resulted in pain 3 days later even and since
then I have irritation and pain in my right shoulder.</p>

<p>Started going to gym 3-4 times and running and rowingâ€¦ rowing gave me
pain on left shoulder randomlyâ€¦ and one time hard, one time many reps.</p>

<h2 id="complaint">complaint</h2>

<p>Still when I sit on the bike, that part hurts. Last week I had a
really bad pain (past 3 days I didnâ€™t do much as somehting was huring
in my leg) and then this. 5th day I start excercising the legs (squats
body weight) and then now I am having this pain where I am limping
moving in my bed is hard (a bit to the side.)</p>

<p>Shoulder is not really greatâ€¦ sometimes doing side planks or planks
is also a problem.</p>

<p>Knee not giving way so to say, but it feels week as hell. It starts
hurting is and around hte knee.</p>
