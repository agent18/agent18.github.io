<h2 id="dealing-with-claims">Dealing with Claims</h2>

<p>We come across claims everywhere. <!-- "There is no doubting the force
of the --> <!-- arguments (that AI is going to take over the world)"
--> We see them in websites like <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/">80khours</a>, when we are in a
conversation, when we are reading books, when we watch <a href="https://youtu.be/6-PNPz_4DO0?t=107">Youtube</a>
etc… We can choose to accept these claims without questioning, or
check the claims without blindly accepting.</p>

<p>The other day I was watching <a href="https://youtu.be/6-PNPz_4DO0?t=107">this video</a> on Youtube and it was a
comedy show on the democratic debate. If it wasn’t for an STM telling
me to look deeper and showing me how to do it, I would have just
believed that Joe Biden was a racist. His past was probably being dug
out by some journalist and he was being exposed now. Let’s take a
closer look at it though:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kamala Harris (paraphrasing): “(Joe Biden (JB))[1] (praised the
reputation of two United States senators)[2] (who built their careers on
segregation of race)[3]”—<a href="https://youtu.be/6-PNPz_4DO0?t=78">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>One of the claims from above</strong>:  [1] praised [2].</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: What Joe Biden said.</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: praised the reputation of two United States Senators …</p>

<p><strong>Example of Subject</strong>: “At least there was some civility. We didn’t
agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it
finished.”—<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/why-did-biden-praise-racist-senator-booker-deblasio-850220/">Rolling Stone</a></p>

<p>Does the example match the definition given by the predicate? It
doesn’t seem so. For “praised”, I would think of something like “The
US Senators were great souls”. When I heard what Kamala said, I
imagined something more serious. After I dug a bit deeper with just
ONE EXAMPLE it didn’t seem like JB was actually praising anyone.</p>

<p>Thus we define Concrete Thinking (CT). Concrete thinking is the
testing of labels (forming a claim), using an example to check against
the given definition. We shall use CT to check the claims made by
everyone.</p>

<h2 id="one-vs-zero">One vs Zero</h2>

<p>How do you know anything about the claim, when you don’t even have an
example? When someone makes a claim it seems that giving one example
instead of zero examples, aka CT, is better. Below are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CT gives the ability to falsify hypothesis</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: Venezuela is fine—Someone</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: Things happening in Venezuela</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: Is fine.</p>

<p><strong>Example of subject</strong>: People eating from the trash despite working a
full time job.</p>

<p>Does it match the definition given by the predicate? It doesn’t seem
so. All it took was one example to falsify the claim.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Labels are misleading</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>:  Trevor: “(Kamala)[1] is going to (wipe the floor with JB)[2]”—<a href="https://youtu.be/6-PNPz_4DO0?t=78">Source</a></p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: What Kamala did!</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: wipe the floor with JB</p>

<p><strong>Example of Subject</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Harris’ average support jumped to 14.7% on Wednesday, up from 7% on
June 25, the day before the two-day debate started. An average of
27.2% of respondents supported Biden as of Wednesday, a drop from
32.1% on June 25.—<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/03/kamala-harris-rises-joe-biden-falls-in-polls-after-democratic-debate.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does the example match the definition given by the predicate? Wiping
the floor with JB could mean that she atleast beat JB in
Polls. According to the above data by CNBC, JB seems to still be
leading KH by more than 10%. So the claim is false.</p>

<p>Until an STM pointed out, I was implicitly assuming Trevor wouldn’t
mislead me. I kinda believed his claims because I thought he did his
research. But when I started to dig in deeper I realized that I didn’t
really know what he meant with “Kamala wiped the floor with JB”. I
really thought Kamala totaled him, either in polls or in exposing who
he truly was. But neither turned out to be true. When Kamala said that
JB supported segregationists, I didn’t even know that I could question
it. I almost immediately assumed that JB’s past was being brought to
the light, just like it happened to trump with his scandals (“grabbing
women by their pussy”). I didn’t want to wait. I had already passed my
judgment.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Even as I was giving examples I see that I am capable of
being mislead. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/kamala-harris-polls.html">According to the New York Times</a>, Kamala “surged”
in three polls after the debate and Joe Biden “Fell”. This sounded to
me like Kamala was overtaking JB in all polls. Until I saw, the actual
numbers by CNBC which was contrary to my understanding of the
labels. Words are quite misleading.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Labels are vague</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>At work I was dealt with some text which I have documented <a href="/DP-8-questions.html">in this
practice</a>, under –&gt; <em>Work: BM with springs</em>.</p>

<p>It so happened that when I first read the text, I felt “confused”, so
many words I didn’t “understand”, I didn’t know what questions to ask
to “clarify” until I CT’ed. One of the claims was,</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: Magnitude of this force is small.</p>

<p>Until I figured out that we were talking about a magnitude of 50N in
our case, and that this magnitude would not damage the frame and hence
was small, this statement meant absolutely nothing to me. Just one
example seemed to “clarify” what the author was trying to tell. Labels
are not only misleading but they are VAGUE.</p>

<p>When I applied CT to the whole document I ended up with only two
claims that I needed clarification out of dozens. The CT process,
seems to be some sort of formal way to “understanding” text.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>0 examples seems to be useless</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>So I was speaking to my brother recently and he seemed to think that
he can’t buy a house in India because he would need a lot of money and
wouldn’t get a loan for it. He was trying to convince me to pitch
money for buying the house. When I simply asked him how much is this
“lot of money” he would need for the mortgage, he didn’t even have an
idea, even to +-300 dollars per month. He said he needs to check with
his bank. My brother was talking in the air, he had no idea what he
was talking about, i.e., he had 0 examples. 0 examples were useless in
convincing anyone.</p>

<p>Clearly one example is much better than 0 examples. What about more
than one example?</p>

<h2 id="one-vs-many">One vs Many</h2>

<p>Journals are typically solid proof of a claim. For example, the claim
“intelligence is not connected to skill” was confirmed after looking
at approximately 45000 samples and inferring from correlation of
intelligence and skill. For claims related to medicine (“Radiation
Therapy cures certain types of Cancer”), it seems like we do need
journal level studies. Luckily for us there are people around the
world working on these type of things. Looking at one example in these
cases, does not seem to verify the claim. However it still helps to
look at examples just to think concretely as ‘Labels are vague’. For
example,</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: Talent is not something you are born with</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: We think of Jerry Rice, who was passed over fifteen times
before being drafted into NFL. Despite this, he is known today as the
greatest NFL player beating his runner-up by 50% in some stats.</p>

<p>But to get journal level proof for every single claim we come across
(like this <a href="https://youtu.be/6-PNPz_4DO0?t=107">Trevor Noah video</a>), takes a lot of time and effort and
is not practical. For example, within 1-2 minutes of <a href="https://youtu.be/6-PNPz_4DO0?t=78">this video</a>,
we have atleast five claims, which certainly need to be checked for
correctness as we have seen above that people just fart out claims. If
we try to procure evidence with journal level rigor it can take a lot
of time and effort.</p>

<p>In the previous section we have seen that quite a lot can be achieved
from giving just ONE EXAMPLE and it takes a few minutes per claim. So
for now we stick to it and try to think concretely and the journal
level option is not practical. We are yet to understand when we might
might need journal level proof and where we might be mislead by ONLY
GIVING ONE EXAMPLE. (For later!).</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-claims-by-reasoning">Dealing with claims by Reasoning</h2>

<p>Having to test everything is time consuming albeit with one example
even. Sometimes we might not even be able to find examples and then
what do we do? Maybe, reasoning is perfectly capable of verifying
claims, hopefully faster. Let’s look at an example.</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: (God)[3] wants you to not (eat onions)[1]</p>

<p><strong>Reasoning</strong>: (Onions)[1] make (you passionate about food)[2] And
(God)[3] doesn’t want (you to be passionate about food)[4]. So God
wants you to not eat onions.</p>

<p>Makes sense! Right? But let’s try to take a deeper look at this. [1]
leads to [2]. [3] doesn’t want [2]. We can infer from this that [3]
doesn’t want [1]—which is the actual claim. So far so good!</p>

<p>But is [1] true though? Is [2] true though? [1] and [2] are but claims
themselves, which means we do not know whether to accept them or
reject them. In that case how can I jump the gun on if “[3] doesn’t
want [1]”? Furthermore, I am unable to test either of the claims given
in the reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: *Reasoning does not seem to work when it contains
claims which cannot be tested.</p>

<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: All claims need to be testable.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s look at an example from 80khours:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: Human Civilization is at stake (due to AI)—<a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/">80khours</a></p>

<p><strong>Reasons</strong>: (The fate of Gorillas)[1] currently depends on the
(actions of humans)[2]. (Similarly, the fate of humanity)[3] may come
to depend more on the (actions of machines than our own)[4].</p>

<p>Statement A: [1] depends on [2] and [2] is “much better” than [1].
Statement B: [3] may depend on [4] if [4] is “much better” than [3].</p>

<p>Statement A can be tested and let’s assume it is true. If Statement B
is true then we assume, that the main claim is satisfied. Statement B
cannot be tested though. The implied claim, ‘if A is true, then B is
true’, also cannot be tested. In conclusion, we don’t know if “Human
Civilization is at stake (due to AI)” as a result of the reasoning.</p>

<p>The above reasoning is what I gave a few weeks back to support the
above claim. But now I realize that it doesn’t absolutely do anything
to support the claim. It felt right though!</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> People can come up with all sorts of claims—that
“feels” right—as they like, but unless it can be tested, we are not
going to be able to say anything about the claim.</p>

<p>So, the above reasoning didn’t give us any information about the
claim, but then maybe we should just use CT on the main claim “Human
Civilization is at stake”.</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: Human Civilization</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: is at stake</p>

<p>Luckily for us 80khours already gives an example, which we need to
check against the definition/Predicate.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: A pharmaceutical company that uses machine learning (ML)
algorithms to synthesize drugs to cure cancer could result in human
extinction. (It could turn out that the ML algorithm, found that the
most effective way of reducing cancer rates was to kill the humans
before they could grow old enough to develop cancer)[5].</p>

<p>We check this against the definition. And yeah if the example happens,
it could kill more than <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=number+of+cancer+patients+in+the+world&amp;oq=number+of+cancer&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.4141j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">17 million people</a>, civilization could be
at stake. But it must be noted that [5] is but a claim which cannot be
tested. It is a hypothetical example. As we have seen above, we do not
respect claims that can’t be tested. This implies that this claim
should be treated in the same level as “God wants us not to eat
onions”, i.e., we should throw it in the trashcan and move on because
it cannot be tested. Contrast this to the following:</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: Human Civilization could be at stake due to Diseases (in
the future)</p>

<p>You can’t test <strong>could be</strong>. But that’s OK. The closest we can come to
testing it seems to be with an example from the past; just like
predicting which bolts will fail based on data from the past.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: In the past we have seen the <em>Black Plague wipe out half
of the people of Western Europe</em>.</p>

<p>There seems to be atleast one example which matches the definition
that the Civilization could be at stake.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we see that people can give all sorts of claims,
reasons and hypothetical examples, but as long as we can’t test it
with atleast ONE EXAMPLE FROM THE PAST, we do not know anything about
the claim.</p>

<p>We have been talking about having “one example atleast” for sometime
now. Having an example for something, does not mean that the claim is
true! Then what is the point of giving that ONE EXAMPLE. Why not two?
Why not journal level studies?</p>

<h2 id="where-all-do-we-need-concrete-thinking">Where all do we need concrete thinking</h2>

<p>It seems like CT is required everywhere where there are labels. To
even know what someone is talking about, we need CT. People can say
“JB praised some bad US senators”. And until we see an example, we
should reserve our judgment about the claim. There seem to be two
cases where we don’t require CT.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Statements of Observation (rawdata)</strong></p>

    <p>For example, I got up in the train and hanged the bag onto the
  hanger; A santro car crashes into the pillar right in front of
  me.</p>

    <p>There seem to be no labels/claims, and as a result no CT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Statements that are already concrete</strong></p>

    <p>“(Mozart)[8] scored a (130 percent on the precocity index)[9]
  whereas (his current contemporaries)[10] scored (thirty to
  five-hundred percent)[10a].”</p>

    <p>This is already a concrete example for the claim: “Mozart isn’t a
  lot more precocious than modern child pianists”. There seem to be
  no labels/claims.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Labels are misleading. If there are no labels, then there seems to be
no point in going further.</p>

<h2 id="the-failure-cases">The failure cases</h2>

<p>As per <a href="/what-is-DP.html">DP routine discussed here</a>, we would like to tabulate and
identify where we are making mistakes and where we are not, and look
at how to improve our overall score. We see that this tabulation can
be done under the following categories:</p>

<p>A) Guessing something is right or wrong or we don’t know.</p>

<p>B) you can test the claim or forget to test the claim</p>

<p>C) The claim could actually be right or actually be wrong</p>

<p>This gives us twelve categories where we could sort our answers to
claims which allows us to see our score. We recollect how while
watching the Trevor Noah video, I had <em>failed to test</em> “Kamala swept
the floor with JB”. I didn’t even realize it. The goal is to <a href="/concrete-thinking.html">improve
the score by working on where I fail most</a>. With the next DP
session we shall create a table at the end to see what our score is.</p>

<!-- I was trying to do [CT a few days back](/concrete-thinking.html). My friend defined to me -->
<!-- what CT was. I made an attempt to do CT, i.e., I had several examples -->
<!-- on which I attempted CT. In the end, I was not sure if I had "done it -->
<!-- right". What I was supposed to do was check the example against it's -->
<!-- definition, but I failed -->

<!-- what happened -->
<!-- was that I got a Crash course on CT. And I axed an STM to tell me if -->
<!-- it is right or wrogn what I did. In this case, it turned out that I -->
<!-- didn't apply the definition of CT and check it against the -->
<!-- example... So essentially it can be said that I didn't test and -->
<!-- further more I didn't know how to test. -->

<!-- In the above case we tried to test it but didn't know how, In the next -->
<!-- case, we failed to test it, but didn't even try! -->

<!-- In the above case I had the definition but failed to test it, I didn't -->
<!-- know how to test it. The claim was wrong and I was not sure if it is -->
<!-- right or wrong. -->

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Concrete thinking is the testing of labels (forming a claim), using an
example to check against the given definition. We shall use CT to
check the claims made by everyone. It is important to give atleast one
testable example for each claim as Labels are Misleading.</p>

<!-- > (Such relationships)[5*] are generally not (integrable)[6], and -->

<!-- I was looking at the above and didn't know why [5] was integrable and -->
<!-- why the consequence was [7]. But when I gave an example for it, it -->
<!-- allowed me to follow the line of thought, i.e., the equations didn't -->

<!-- substitutions, aka making labels less vague for me. I am sure the -->
<!-- above is vague as hell for you, because there is no real example -->
<!-- attached to it. Contrast that to, -->

<!-- Let's look at another example from 80khours: -->

<!-- > (Gaining career capital)[3] is (important throughout your -->
<!-- > career)[4], but especially when (you’re young and you have a lot to -->
<!-- > learn)[5]. -->

<!-- **Claims**: [3] is [4]. -->

<!-- **Subject**: [3] -->

<!-- **Predicate**: [4] -->

<!-- **Example of [3]**: Gaining python skills  -->

<!-- For the definition of important, (which is also a label), we think of -->
<!-- making more CASH with gaining career capital, than without gaining -->
<!-- career capital. This could be what 80khours mean, as it is one of -->
<!-- their intentions to help the world by bringing in money to where -->
<!-- needed. -->

<!-- So, is gaining python skills important every instant of my working life? I -->
<!-- think it is hard to test this as I need an example of someone who has -->
<!-- constantly improved their python. If I look at a particular instant -->
<!-- then it is easier and we shall take that route as it is practical. -->

<!-- We check if learning python every moment of my life will result in more -->
<!-- cash than I have now. I guess that's not practical. Something that we -->
<!-- can check is if learning python gets us more cash.  -->

<!-- With gaining python skills, it improves the chance of getting Data -->
<!-- Science jobs which pays higher than my current job according to -->
<!-- payscale. -->

<!-- Without gaining python skills, it is not possible to get Data Science -->
<!-- jobs which pays higher than my current job. -->

<!-- The Claim is not False. -->

<!-- This is as far as we go  -->

<!-- > Career Capital is (anything)[5] that (puts you in a better position)[6] to (make a -->
<!-- > difference in the future)[7], including (skills, connections, -->
<!-- > credentials and runway)[8] -->

<!-- Another example:  -->

<!-- > high tech companies have high profits this year! -->

<!-- We think of Apple and we think of Apple generating more revenue than -->
<!-- amazon this year. -->

<!-- With Apple it seems to be true. -->

<!-- **Isolate problem area** -->

<!-- dj rixen book! -->

<!-- **Concrete thinking in real life** -->

<!-- An STM gave me this example: -->

<!-- They had a new AC installed. Just before the installers were leaving -->
<!-- he wanted to do one test. You could also do like a test with special -->
<!-- equipment that will test the voltage, the swing speed and amount of -->
<!-- aerosol (journal paper level). And as soon as he did the first test, -->
<!-- it worked. Great. He was quite satisfied but decided to go just a -->
<!-- little bit further. He tried to switch on the timer and then the -->
<!-- installer informed that he had to first press the on timer and then -->
<!-- only he could press the off timer. Something he would have never -->
<!-- figured out by himself. and so on... was the story where there were -->
<!-- more issues in the operation, all because of this one test. -->

<!-- Now what am I trying to say We can always give one example... Getting -->
<!-- more examples is hard (example needed here). Journal level information -->
<!-- for a claim takes time to get (example needed here!) -->

<!-- I will give two more examples!  -->

<!-- > There could be other scenarios that 80khours hasn't investigated -->
<!-- > which could be important -->

<!-- If 80khours saw in the past that they had 100 topics and 50 topics -->
<!-- seemed critical, then in the next set, we would predict that there -->
<!-- seems to be a high chance that we would expect atleast a few topics to -->
<!-- be critical. -->
