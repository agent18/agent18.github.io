<p><a href="http://www.cryonics.org/about-us/">Cryonics</a> is the technology where in people are frozen immediately in liquid N2 after being declared dead, in the hopes of giving future science the best chance to revive us. It can be about replacing damaged tissues to organs, to reconstructing your entire brain and simulating it and so on, such that life after revival is <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/break-cryonics-down.html">worth living enough</a>. It is estimated that there is a <a href="/to-be-or-not-to-be-frozen-prolty.html">5% chance that Cryonics will succeed</a>.</p>
