    <p>Install the game:</p>

    <p>From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzXowgAUS9I&amp;feature=youtu.be">YouTube comments</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You have to enable Steam Proton for all your Steam library and
then download and install the game as normal. Once that is done,
then follow the instructions on this video. I did a previous
video on Steam Proton that might be helpful -

    <p>sudo apt install winetricks</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>done. :)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Need to install the Media Foundation workaround for Wine</p>

    <p>https://github.com/z0z0z/mf-install</p>

    <p>Download and install it using the following after moving to folder
 of downloaded mf-install
 referencing to the game‚Äôs ‚Äúinstallation location‚Äù:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> WINEPREFIX="/home/eghx/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/813780/pfx" ./mf-install.sh 
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install Microsoft Visual Runtime</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> WINEPREFIX="/home/ryanjohnson/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/1017900/pfx"
 winetricks -q vcrun2017
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rename the video folder (otherwise it will crash)</p>

    <p>right click on game in steath ‚Äì&gt; properties ‚Äì&gt; go to local files
 ‚Äì&gt; Assets ‚Äì&gt; change the name of ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù to anything else.</p>

    <p>You will get an error ‚ÄúUnable to setup bla bla bla‚Äù‚Ä¶ noi worries
 keep gehen.</p>

    <p>Alternatively you can add -nostartup to the game‚Äôs custom
 launcher, this has the same affect as renaming the Video folder. ???</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶</p>

<p>redoing the mf-install.sh line‚Ä¶</p>

<p>worst case‚Ä¶ remove game and redo the above steps fresh?</p>

<p>Try <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/dwuplr/how_to_run_age_of_empires_2_definitive_edition_on/">this guide</a> that I found on reddit</p>

<h2 id="winetricks-vcrun2017-not-found">winetricks vcrun2017 not found</h2>

<ul>
  <li>error: Unknown arg vcrun2017</li>
</ul>

<p>so we atleast need a later version of 20170823</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>link for Winetricks instructions and readme
:https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks</p>

    <p><a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=winetricks">only old (2014) version of winetricks</a> available in 16.04</p>

</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Started with purging winetricks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Installing latest winetricks based off of here:
https://askubuntu.com/a/755060/443958</p>

    <p>Did only first 2 steps. and now have version: 20200412</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now did the vcrun2017 And got error:</p>

<p>Now removed wine and updating to 4.x from 1.6.2 based on <a href="https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu">winehqeiki</a></p>

<p>Notes on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wine+32+bit+64+bit+difference&amp;oq=wine+32+bit+64+bit+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j33l7.4958j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">winprefix and 32 and 64 bit shit</a></p>

<p>There is so much detail here. And I am afraid I fucked up‚Ä¶ I did the
vcrun2017 command but then I got an error type message.. Was that an
error or what?</p>

<p>should I change wineprefix to 32bit?</p>

<p>after successful installation of wine 5.0 I tried the vcrun2017
command again. It seems that wine is finally active and working and
asking me to install ‚Äúgecko‚Äù etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Checked it out. It is very easy to do. But runs the risk of fucking up
Ubuntu and then re-installing. Currently all I need is like 10-20gb
space which I have more than enough of in my ‚Äúnon-root‚Äù partition.</p>

<p>Made some notes <a href="/resizing-ubuntu-dual-boot-partition.html">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have very little space in the ‚Äú/‚Äù and we need to install things not
in ‚Äú/‚Äù but else where.</li>
</ul>

<p>exp:

<ul>
  <li>Steam doesn‚Äôt install things in the root. It gives choice to install
elsewhere.</li>
