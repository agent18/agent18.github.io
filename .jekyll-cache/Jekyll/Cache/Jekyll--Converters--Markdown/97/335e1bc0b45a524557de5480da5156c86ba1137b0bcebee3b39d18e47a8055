<p>I want to spend a few more days doing some research into particular
choices of work, and answering other questions that would help in
making the final ABZ choices for my career. With this “essay” I
attempt to explore the questions needed to be answered.</p>

<h2 id="career">Career</h2>

<p>Based on <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80k hrs</a>’s research it is clear that there are
many problems that need people. Right now I don’t know which is the
best problem to work on and in what capacity I should work on. Plus I
most probably don’t have the skills. As per the suggestions of <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80k
hrs</a>, we should look to gain flexible career capital and be
good at what we do.</p>

<p><strong>What is career capital?</strong> <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/#the-bottom-line">what are the best ways to gain it?</a></p>

<p><strong>What is flexible career capital?</strong> what does it mean to have flexible
career capital? Some concrete examples of people having flexible
career capital please.</p>

<p><strong>What are some examples of things I see myself doing in 10-15
years?</strong> Give example career profiles on linkedin, on 80k hours of
what you want to become and what you could become.</p>

<p>But to me roughly, I want flexible career capital allowing me to either
do direct work in the future, or  contribute modest earnings to
NGO’s. With that I mean I should be capable of jumping to something
bigger and better when the time arises.</p>

<p>A few ways I think I might actually contribute to society in the
long run (based on guesstimated personal fit):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Earn to give in data science / Management consulting / programming</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working as a researcher at GiveWell, looking at data and
determining which place needs funding and how effective they are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having the ability to found companies that can cause much bigger
impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manage a business or start something that can make millions or is
useful to a large number of people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>or develop capability to have a career like this:</p>

<p>P.S</p>

<p>The first hour was horrible, 2 and 3 rd hour become better, but not
like yesterday. In total 2.5 hrs. I was working on something that I had written earlier,
possibly that’s the reason. After first 45 mins took about 40 mins break</p>
