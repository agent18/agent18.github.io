I"«<p><strong>Replaceability of person</strong></p>

<p>Counterfactual estimates for the value created by a person is the
difference between utility created when he exists and the utility
created when he doesnâ€™t exist. Say the job creates an impact of
X<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>. If you are completely replaceable, i.e., there is no utility
difference whether you are there or not, then your value per year is
0k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>. If you are not replaceable at all, i.e., there is a job only
you can do and if you donâ€™t take it up, no one will do it, then you
get all of the impact from the job (all of X<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>).</p>

<p>But reality you are going to be somewhere in between. I look at a
scenario based on <em>many assumptions</em> to identify what could be my
impact based on how much better I am.</p>

<p>It appears that how good you are compared to the last person you
displace defines how much impact you will have. Assume the following
table.</p>

<p>There are two scenarios <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scenario WITH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scenario WITHOUT</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AA</code>
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">II</code> people exist. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AA</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FF</code> work in EAO. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GG</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JJ</code> work in
ETG in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scenario WITH</code>. When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AA</code> is removed you get the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scenario
WITHOUT</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GG</code> moves to work in EA and his ETG is lost
unfortunately. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>, â€¦ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I</code> refer to their percentage
contribution of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AA</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BB</code>, â€¦. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">II</code>â€™s in EA job. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EA</code> refers to
dollars moved.</p>

<p><em>Assuming all EA jobs have the same impact</em> makes the calculation
simpler, and we quickly see that the Counterfactual Impact (CI) = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A-G x
EA + ETG by GG</code>.</p>

<p>Assuming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AA</code> got a job in GiveWell, and based on our calculation
above, we know that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EA</code> is 330k<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> is 100%.</p>

<p>Typical passionate EAs seem to donate 10% of their income. If they are
from US this would be in the order of 20k with a 200k salary letâ€™s
say. If they are in the EU it would be in the order of 5-10k (which I
see as feasible).</p>

<p>Assuming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AA</code> is 20% better than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GG</code> and the person ETGing is from
EU, we get CI = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20% x 330k$ + 5k$</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">65k</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p>CI for a person like David Roodman. Should he continue doing research
or should he start doing ETG. Is there someone who is currently not
doing EA to replace David Roodman?</p>

<p>Do senior researcher roles get filled from other research roles or do
they have people coming from ETG. I see a number of people in GiveWell
and OPP who seem to have grown into the role of Sr. Researcher

<p>There are cases of people like Catherine and Jon Behar , who have come
into the like of GiveWell or TLYCS from being a journalist or from a
consulting job for &gt;5 years. When you look at the senior research
analyst positions it appears that people grow into it. Teryn is a good
example, who has been working in Rand and now moved to GW recently.</p>

<p>So when we get a job in GW 10 years from now, we still have the same
competitiveness, and we check our replaceability then, we see that if
we leave, we end up leaving a dent which will be filled by who ever is
there, it seems like you still care about that last person you
displace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GG</code>, who without 10 years of experience is probably going to
suck. So for the first few years even if I accept I suck and for the
rest if I donâ€™t, that seems to decrease my replaceability. So if I
assume an avg. replaceability of 70% even (seems high, considering
that with 10years of research I am going to be much better than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GG</code>),</p>

<p>But I did kinda steal someones job at the bottom and didnâ€™t allow him
because I was a tad better. If you are better you get the job. It is a
meritocratic system here. Yes. If I donâ€™t intervene, prolly there is
not much impact, I guess I would try to work my ass off in DS and get
a job in the US.</p>

<p>See then it just doesnâ€™t seem to matter what I do.. if we are both
pretty much good and are going to work our asses off then his ETG
would be the difference. If I ETG, it might probably be
similar. Assuming we are serious. And maybe more chance for him to
pick up a nice ETG job.</p>

<p>So I want to know what people are ready to giveup. Are they like me?
Are they like</p>

<p>If they want to replace someone from OPP who is a Senior, that is
going to be hard.</p>

<p>I will never come to solution on this now. Letâ€™s pack this and come
back later. Itâ€™s a separate essay by itself.</p>
