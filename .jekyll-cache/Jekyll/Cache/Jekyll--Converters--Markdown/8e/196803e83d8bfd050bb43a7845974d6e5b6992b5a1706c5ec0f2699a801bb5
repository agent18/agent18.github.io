<p>For a while now I have been writing. Some of the metrics I use to measure my progress are number of posts written in x days, number of posts written entirely, number of words written per post and the like.</p>

<p>My friend came to me a couple of years back and said, measure not the means but the end. He explained further, that there is no reason to believe that your means will get you to the end. Example, measuring number of words to imporve your rational ability.</p>

<p>More over, I still continue measuring with the above discussed sad metrics implicitly. My goal currently was to write everyday for which I set myself up for a pact with a friend where in, I write every day and publish a post, except friday with a penalty of 3 euros, everyday I missed. I didn‚Äôt put constraints on the number of words, except that the post should have been revised atleast once. I usually see that it is around 400 words and of some ‚Äúinternal‚Äù quality. The point of doing this is to primarily get the confidence of an STM to co-conspire. In the case that it does not work out it still serves the purpose of having inculcated a habit in me, to keep writing, with a penalty of 3 euros in case I don‚Äôt write in a day.</p>

<p>I came across this guy on my friends blog in his post on deep thinking. The idea being that we should look at deep thinking. Deep thinking to the extent that you measure metrics such as number of deep thought hours, as sometime you do not know how long a task can take. The other thing being using milestones. It ‚Äúfeels‚Äù like a nice balance between these two should help. More on this tomorrow. I know its a friday. But today I did shit.</p>
