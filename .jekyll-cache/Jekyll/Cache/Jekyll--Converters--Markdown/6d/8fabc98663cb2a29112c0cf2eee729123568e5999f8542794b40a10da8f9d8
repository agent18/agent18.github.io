<p>Based on procedures of a study.</p>

<p>Alternative explanations ruling out.</p>

<p><strong>Cause and effect</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a brief summary, you can only assume cause-and-effect when you
meet the following three criteria in your study:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The cause preceded the effect in terms of time.</li>
    <li>The cause and effect vary together.</li>
    <li>There are no other likely explanations for this relationship that
you have observed.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Factors that improve internal validity</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Randomization</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Random selection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blinding participants</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experimental manipulation (cessation to smokers)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Same study protocol to both groups</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Causation Correlation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recall that two variables being statistically related does not
necessarily mean that one causes the other. ‚ÄúCorrelation does not
imply causation.‚Äù For example, if it were the case that people who
exercise regularly are happier than people who do not exercise
regularly, this implication would not necessarily mean that
exercising increases people‚Äôs happiness. It could mean instead that
greater happiness causes people to exercise (the directionality
problem) or that something like better physical health causes people
to exercise and be happier (the third-variable problem).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Checking assumptions</strong></p>

<p>If they use t-distributions then they come with assumptions.</p>

<p>check if the assumptions are valid.</p>

<p>If there are two samples then each sample has different assumptions</p>
