<p>A bias is a shortcut rule, which helps us calculate what we are supposed to do with low computational cost. Availability bias basically chooses whats important based on an eventsâ€™ availability. The true value system could be hiding behind the biases. If we remove this availability bias, would it mean that we can see our true value system?</p>
