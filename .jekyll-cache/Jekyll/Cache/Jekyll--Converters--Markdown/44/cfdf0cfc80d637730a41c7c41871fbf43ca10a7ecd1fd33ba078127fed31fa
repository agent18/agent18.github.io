I"Ê<p>I am going to go step by step with the 80k blog and see where it takes me. I see there are lot of great points, amazingly evidence based. I would like to read about it and summarize the contents to my liking. Based on the old articles, it is clear to us that we want to use our time in the best way possible to create as much as impact as possible. This could mean donating 10k euros a year or 100k $ a year based on what is possible and high impact.</p>
