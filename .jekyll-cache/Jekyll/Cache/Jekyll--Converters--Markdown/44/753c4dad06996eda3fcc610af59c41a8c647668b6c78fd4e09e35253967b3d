  <p>In other cases though, say (when you are organizing information and
providing solutions) [1] - based on that - to your boss, you might
want to (be like Tiger Woods, conscious, controlled and not
automatic)[2]‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You‚Äôve described [2] using a lovely concrete example in the <a href="/DP-CT-examples.html">last
post</a>. However, [1] is sorely lacking in examples. What is this
‚Äúorganizing information‚Äù? Or ‚Äúproviding solutions‚Äù? That could be
anything from ‚Äúit‚Äôs hot today‚Äù all the way up to ‚Äúe = mc^2‚Äù. Contrast
that to PG‚Äôs <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vwplan.html">business plan</a> for his startup in 1995:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OVERVIEW Webgen allows clients to generate web catalogs remotely.</p>

  <p>There are several other companies that can generate and serve web
catalogs. The best known site of this type is Marketplace MCI
(www.internetmci.com). But while these other sites use their
generators in-house to build catalogs from materials provided by
clients, Webgen‚Äôs generator can be used interactively by anyone with
a modem and a copy of Netscape. ‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might want to describe what you‚Äôre doing in such terms, like
‚Äú<em>generate web catalogs remotely</em>‚Äù or ‚Äú<em>used interactively</em>‚Äù, so that
it is clear even to an outsider what you‚Äôre doing.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Mission #5:</strong> Time to chunk it up. Right now, you are working on
sentences and paragraphs at a time. That is, you get feedback about
your output dimensions after writing the entire paragraph (or God
forbid, the entire essay). The feedback isn‚Äôt immediate enough
(principle #3 from TiO). In contrast, look at how I narrowed down the
specific phrases [1] and [2] where you gave examples or not.</p>

<p>You need to take passages you feel you don‚Äôt understand clearly
(perhaps some things you‚Äôve written yourself about important yet
unclear issues in ‚Äúrationality‚Äù and some outside material about tough
technical problems), mark within parentheses each important phrase
like I did with [1] and [2], check if you‚Äôve given an example for it,
and if not, rewrite it with a concrete example. If you‚Äôre not sure if
a phrase is important or not, err in favor of an example. 200
repetitions should be a good start. Soon, you will come to notice
immediately if you are throwing out words without any concrete
example, the way a misspelled word in an editor shows up with red
underlines.</p>

<p>Does it mean that PG and EY will give examples after every phrase? Not
necessarily. But they will have an example in mind as they write. I
suspect that when we say ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt think clearly‚Äù, we mean that
their words don‚Äôt correspond to any concrete example (see: ‚Äúcritical
thinking‚Äù). And when your words don‚Äôt correspond to anything concrete,
you can make them say anything. For a striking example, check out this
philosophical passage that EY tore to pieces:
https://youtu.be/D6peN9LiTWA?t=1067</p>

<p>What was the problem there? The words didn‚Äôt correspond to any known
piece of reality. They were figments of the poet‚Äôs imagination, and
yet he thought they described something real. It sounded convincing
even to me. I was like, yeah, maybe we really are fallen people
compared to those wise, brotherly ancients.</p>

<p>How would you and I tackle that? We would stop at the first phrase in
the first sentence: ‚ÄúIn the age when life on Earth was full‚Äù. Ok. Give
me a historical example or empirical evidence for what you mean by
‚Äúlife on Earth was full‚Äù. People had AC‚Äôs? Cars? Long lives? Lots of
sex? (Could be true. Could also be not true. Need empirical
evidence. And if you say you can‚Äôt get that evidence from millenia
ago‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs the whole point! Why are you using as an example
something that you have no real evidence about? End of story then and
there.)</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take another example closer to home. ‚ÄúI need to practice
critical thinking and become a master.‚Äù - Anonymous, 1785 AD. Well,
Mr. Anonymous, what is this ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù you speak of? Let‚Äôs
see at least one example (after you‚Äôve practiced on a bunch of other
sentences).</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong>: All fluff words (like problem solving, critical thinking)

<p><strong>P:</strong> I want to get better at ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù.</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> In the article on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity">scope insensitivity</a> there is a
lot of discussion about how to design experiments that distinguish the
‚Äúprototype-dominated‚Äù affect and the warm glow of moral
satisfaction. I don‚Äôt understand this. There is a whole discussion and
I am finding it hard to wrap my head around it. I‚Äôd like to get better
here.</p>

<p>At work, I am having to do quite some ‚Äúproblem solving‚Äù. By that I
mean I am given a couple of observations (about leak in the Vacuum
Chamber). I need to isolate what is the problem is (is it leaking from
outside? or are these virtual leaks? etc‚Ä¶), I need to design
experiments (pump down the chamber and measure leak) and I need to
convey the results (make a presentation and explain how my diagnosis
is right). This is hard for me, I want to become better here, i.e., I
often find myself banging my head to make sense of what is happening
and presenting it. :)</p>

<!-- **Goal 2:** Not feel bored -->

<h3 id="what-is-and-isnt-dp-38">What is and isn‚Äôt DP (38)</h3>

<p>From <a href="/DP-CT-examples.html">my summary on TIO about ‚ÄòWhat is and isn‚Äôt DP‚Äô</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes I go to basketball practice and try a few shots from one
spot. Then I try (some drills in ball handling)[3] to (improve play
during the game)[2]. I try (multiple variations)[3] 2-3 times each
and get bored and then play some one-on-ones with someone and feel
happy that I have clocked 2 more hours of practice (that hopefully
gets me to amazing levels someday)[4]; you know, ‚ÄòPractice makes
perfect‚Äô and the like. The author hosts a similar example from his
life when he went golfing and (‚Äúpracticed‚Äù with golf balls)[5]. He
says with conviction that (this will do jack shit to your
performance)[6].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> improve play during the game</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> So every Sunday I play basketball with my friends. Mostly I suck
and people make fun of it, especially when you make air balls or miss
a silly ass layup when you are so close to the basket. Whilst this is
me, my friends, almost all of them, have very good shooting percentage
and good range from where they can shoot. <em>I would like to be atleast
as good as them.</em></p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> some drills in ball handling; multiple variations</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> I start with shooting from different places randomly (roughly 20
shots), and then try 5 spin moves, and then move on to left handed
layups</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Hopefully gets me to amazing levels</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> amazing levels like that of my peers (in a year or two)</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> ‚Äúpracticed‚Äù with golf balls</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> The author hit a few balls and picked one of 1000 reasons why he
didn‚Äôt hit the ball ‚Äúright‚Äù, then believed he was practicing for
it. He then got distracted to another reason he didn‚Äôt hit the ball
‚Äúright‚Äù. In the end he hit about a few hundred balls and felt happy
that he was getting better.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> this will do jack shit to your performance</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> You will NEVER be better than your peers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea of deliberate practice (DP) is quite different from the
above form of practice. Jerry Rice according to the author is a near
perfect example of someone who did massive amounts of DP and in the
end became a legend.</p>

  <p>Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
examining. It is activity (designed specifically to improve
performance)[1], often with a teacher‚Äôs help; (it can be repeated a
lot)[2]; (feedback on results is continuously available)[3]; (it‚Äôs
highly demanding mentally)[4], (whether the activity is purely
intellectual, such as chess or business-related activities)[5], or
(heavily physical, such as sports;)[6] and (it isn‚Äôt much fun)[7].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> designed specifically to improve performance</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> You want to be a better basket ball player. How do you do that? You
first need to identify spaces where you suck, example, shooting, lay
ups, spin moves, passing, court vision, team playing etc‚Ä¶ Lets for
now say we want to improve shooting, we need to design an activity
that will specifically improve that. We saw earlier how I had designed
an activity to improve shooting. I shot from random places, and did
less than 20 shots and moved on to something else. That is surely
designed by me but not to improve performance. Instead I should shoot
100 shots from similar spots. Or practice until I get the ball in a
100 times. There is a huge body of knowledge about the mechanics, the
form and the way to do the practice, which is available to us to
improve our skills.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> it can be repeated a lot</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> The pathetic practice I had designed earlier seriously missed out
on this. I shot 20 times from different places. Instead I should have shot
20-100 times from the same place over and over again.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> feedback on results is continuously available</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> When I am practicing shooting, I look at the parameter of shooting
percentage and log it every week as I practice. So I know if I am
getting better or if I still suck, so I can take some additional steps
to keep improving. In addition I train with a friend who gives me
critical feedback, laughs at me when I suck. Furthermore, on game
nights you see if practice is helping you or not.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> it‚Äôs highly demanding mentally</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> It is quite a mental load to practice. You are physically tired and
you still need to keep grinding. Yesterday I was practicing this spin
move and wanted to do it 20 times. By the 10th time, I felt like I
wanted to stop, but I needed to keep grinding. So I had to push myself
to do more.</p>

<p><strong>E2:</strong> I was practicing some shooting and I was sucking so hard, but I
still needed to keep grinding over all the negativity. I have put in
so much hard work over the last many weeks and the extent to which I
sucked was incredible, but I still need to grind. I was tired, my arms
couldn‚Äôt do it and I forced myself to do those 100 shots from close to
the 3-point-line anyways.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> activity is purely intellectual</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚Äúsuch as chess or business-related activities‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> activity is heavily physical</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚ÄúSports‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> It isn‚Äôt much fun</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Shizuka Arakawa, gold medal in figure skating, had fallen on ice
with her derriere atleast 20000 times. It did get her the gold medal
after years and years of practice though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It‚Äôs designed specifically to improve performance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>During DP, one must identify certain (sharply defined elements that
need improvement)[2] and (work on them intently)[3]. These practices
should be designed in such a way that (they stretch your current
abilities)[4]. The great performers, (see a couple of issues and
isolate each one of them)[5] and (work on them)[6] until they have
(seen sufficient improvement before moving on to the next
aspect)[7].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> sharply defined elements that need improvement</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> shooting 3 pointers, or delivering spin moves,</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> work on them intently</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> <a href="https://uproxx.com/dimemag/kobe-bryant-story-jay-williams-playoff-workout/2/">Kobe Bryant the legend</a> who quits practicing only <a href="https://www.businessinsider.nl/kobe-bryant-insane-work-ethic-2013-8/?international=true&amp;r=US">after he
makes 400 shots</a> (around 3 hrs of only shooting). Legend!</p>

<p><strong>E2:</strong> Jerry Rice working out all day during the off season to improve
his explosiveness and precision in running patterns</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> they stretch your current abilities [4]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Jerry Rice‚Äôs off-season workout was known for being extremely
strenuous and he was the only one who could perform it.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> see a couple of issues and isolate each one of them</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Benjamin Franklin understood from his father that his work
stinks. His father pointed out a few of his flaws. One of the issues
was that he had poor vocabulary, so he designed his practice just for
that. Another practice for organization of the prose etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>E2:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not being the fastest receiver in the league turned out not to
matter. He (Jerry Rice) became famous for the precision of his
patterns. His weight training gave him tremendous strength. His
trail running gave him control so he could change directions
suddenly without signaling his move. - TIO chapter 4</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> work on them</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> BF found the best work, made notes on it, a few days later he would
make his own version and compare it to original.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> seen sufficient improvement before moving on to the next aspect [7]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> In basketball, currently I would be happy if I reached 60%
shooting percentage every week in practice before adding other aspects
to my practice, such as shooting when there is a defender
etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>E2:</strong> You master the scales while learning piano before moving on to
things like trill, jumping octaves.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> the author suggests to atleast give it (getting feedback from the
teacher) another thought</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Ben Franklin‚Äôs teacher was the writings of Spectator, some work
that is clearly of a higher class than what he was capable of doing.</p>

<p><strong>E2:</strong> All sportsmen have coaches</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> While learning it is good to be in the zone where we are just beyond our
comfort zone; which makes us stretch our abilities; it is quite
motivating instead of being a daunting task to approach‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> I can easily bike with an average-heart-rate (AHR) of 161bpm over
20 mins. If I stick to that every day there will be no improvement. I
need to push myself to a much higher AHR. 175 bpm is too hard, so much
so that the I am crying every minute and it becomes so repulsive to
pick up such a task later. On the other hand 165bpm is just outside my
comfort zone and is challenging enough. If I really wanted to train to
be the best of the best of the best, I should be going for 175bpm, but
it drastically tones down the motivation and it becomes such a
daunting task especially after surviving a grueling weight training
workout.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can be repeated a lot</p>

  <p>In golf the ball rarely gets buried into the sand. Such shots are
quite rare. But when they happen you cannot expect to perform well
as you have rarely performed that shot. Top performers repeat a
lot. (Isolation of the specific space where you need to improve is
key)[1], (followed by a lot of repetitions)[2].</p>

  <p>Ted Williams, baseball‚Äôs greatest hitter, would practice hitting
until his hands bled. Pete Maravich, whose college basketball
records still stand after more than thirty years, would go to the
gym when it opened in the morning and shoot baskets until it closed
at night.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Isolation of the specific space where you need to improve is key</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> One of the important aspects of ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù is to see all
words as clear cut examples and not as vague sentences. Identifying
where examples are needed and providing them is the skill</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> followed by a lot of repetition</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> identifying where examples are needed and providing them for ~200
phrases, like I am doing now.</p>

<p><!-- 25 phrases done up until now. --></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Feedback</p>

  <p>Following all this, one can work on his technique but it is very
important (to see progress and get feedback)[1]. Otherwise one will
(stop getting any better and stop caring about the end
goal)[2]. (Feedback is extremely crucial to feel
motivated)[3]. (Sometimes results might need interpretation)[4],
(trusting your own judgment might not really be the best way to go
about it)[5]. Is the blog post clear to a new reader? Will people
get the main idea? Is it organized well? Paul Graham for example,
appears to take this very seriously. Before he publishes a post, he
runs atleast a few loops of getting feedback from his friends
followed by correction before publishing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> to see progress and get feedback</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> If you are able to lift more weight the next time you go to the gym
you see progress, the feedback is that you are getting better.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> You will stop getting any better and stop caring about the end</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> If you don‚Äôt get better at the gym, then you start to question what
you are doing here, if this is really for you etc‚Ä¶ Will you ever be
able to lift 100kg? I had such a slump a few weeks back and I am
trying to do things that will get me over that slump, like eating
properly and training harder.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Feedback is extremely crucial to feel motivated</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> I mainly care about the Basketball I play on Sunday. Based on how I
suck and where all I suck I feel the motivation to come back every
Saturday and grind. This week I sucked so hard I want to up my
practice like that of the <a href="https://uproxx.com/dimemag/kobe-bryant-story-jay-williams-playoff-workout/2/">Kobe Bryant the legend</a>.</p>

<p>There was a time when for three weeks straight I didn‚Äôt really get to
play the Sunday games, I am sure I contemplated not going to train on
Saturdays during those weeks. I was like, ‚ÄúI mean whats the point of
going and grinding‚Äù. But I didn‚Äôt have problems going to practice
this Saturday, nor with last Saturday. :)</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Sometimes results might need interpretation</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Its easy to fool yourself that you played ‚Äúwell‚Äù today. If you
scored the last basket, you usually feel good. For a better
understanding of how well you actually performed, you need to look at
some sort of statistics like how many points you scored per game or
what was your field goal percentage or even compliments from your
peers ( #gaining-peoples-respect!)</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> trusting your own judgment might not really be the best way to go
about it</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚ÄúIs the blog post clear to a new reader? Will people get the main
idea? Is it organized well? Paul Graham for example, appears to take
this very seriously. Before he publishes a post, he runs atleast a few
iterations of getting feedback from his friends followed by correction
before publishing it.‚Äù #PG</p>

  <p>It is painful</p>

  <p>I can imagine working on things like (improving writing)[1]. I know
(I suck,  I have read my essays)[2]. (First I would need to identify
good sentences and maybe try to emulate them in other works
consciously)[3]. This could be qualified as DP. But the shear
(repulsion to that activity is huge)[4], and pushing through all of it
for maybe atleast 10k sentences, makes it painful I think. The
violinists from the Ericsson experiment stated practice as the least

<p><strong>E:</strong> Looking at better-text in comparison to your work and trying to

<p><strong>E:</strong> Today as I am making this exercise, it is hard. Generating examples
of all kinds, knowing that I might not really make the goal of 200,

<p><strong>P:</strong> it will distinguish you all the more from the rest</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Aamir Khan for a movie makes a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aVw1gZ9Ncg">ridiculous transformation in short
time</a>. It was not easy or fun for him as you can see from the
video. He is constantly made to push beyond what he is capable of. He
struggles with doing it everyday, but pushes himself anyway. His
willingness, the mental struggle he had to go through to do what he
did distinguishes him all the more from the rest; just like Jerry
Rice. How many Jerry Rice‚Äôs and Aamir Khan‚Äôs do we know of?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These tasks (whether physical or not)[1], seem to drain out much of
our mental energy)[2] as they are all about (improving an
unsatisfactory performance and trying your hardest to improve

the upper limit, (across disciplines)[4], with sessions frequently
lasting no more than 90 minutes. The study of violinists (TIO chap
4) for example shows that the kids that do DP slept more not only
during the night but also during the afternoons.</p>

  <p>There is (nothing more practical than sound thinking)[1]. No matter
what your circumstance or goals, no matter where you are, or what
problems you face, you are (better off if your thinking is
skilled)[2]. As a manager, leader, employee, citizen, lover, friend,
parent ‚Äî in every realm and situation of your life ‚Äî (good thinking
pays off)[3]. (Poor thinking)[4] in turn, (inevitably causes
problems, wastes time and energy, engenders frustration and
pain)[5].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is way too much vagueness in this paragraph and the coming
paragraphs. Oh my! especially for a website titled ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Nothing more practical than sound thinking</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> If engaging in drama consumes your mind, and does not allow you to
focus on things, you should stay away from drama, even if it means
apologizing to a superior when it not your fault; as your priority is
to squash the beef and move on with other important things.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> better off if your thinking is skilled; good thinking pays off</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Skilled thinking can come up with ‚Äúright answers‚Äù for questions
like, ‚Äúshould we marry?‚Äù, or ‚ÄúShould we freeze ourselves‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Poor thinking</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> I was moving from one house to another, and in an attempt to save
400 euros I brought self some major stress over the entire month. I
didn‚Äôt know how to equate money to time, I still struggle with the
idea.</p>

<p>I sometimes end up wasting hours and hours, just so I can save a few
10‚Äôs of euros. I was buying a phone recently and spent the entire day
trading off different phones, when I could be doing a week of courses
from my Data Science course, and keep moving ahead. A phone is
250‚Ç¨. In the worst case if I bought a bad phone I could return it or
buy a new one in a year. I was trying to make the best decision and
guess what, the phone still sucks, its not good enough. Now I want to
return this phone and buy another one which is even more
pricy. #GreatThinkingNot. Lack of ability to realize what is important
and how to trade off money is one example of my poor thinking. Some of
the realization is in hindsight, but I am about to do it again :(</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> inevitably causes problems, wastes time and energy, engenders
frustration and pain</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Once I was expected to inform if the Vacuum chamber was able to go
to low pressures. I did some experiments and saw that the in some
cases it went to the expected low pressures and in other cases the
leak was too high. I was expected to present this, along with why I
think it was happening, how to verify my claim and also propose
solutions for the reducing the leak. So I looked at the observations
and failed to tell a convincing story (logical) about why we were
observing certain phenomenon. I felt quite confused while making the
presentation even, and naturally it showed in the review.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Critical thinking is the disciplined art of ensuring that you use
the best thinking you are capable of in any set of
circumstances. The general goal of thinking is to ‚Äúfigure out the
lay of the land‚Äù in any situation we are in. We all have multiple
choices to make. We need the best information to make the best
choices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract‚ÄîThis paper presents a new paradigm for design of
(mechanical components that are subjected to dynamic loading in
their regular operation)[2]. Traditionally, such design tasks are
handled by (artificially raising the level of the static load)[3] by
introducing a factor of safety, which is meant to compensate for the
(unknown variations of the actual loads)[4]. This method works
nicely when the (dynamic component of the total loads are low)[5],
but (not necessarily otherwise)[6]. The connecting rod of an IC
engine is such a component, as it suffers large inertial load when
the engine runs at high speeds. To design such components, an
iterative strategy is presented, which relies (upon a kinetostatic
model)[7] to assess the dynamic loads, and (incorporates the effects
of the mass distribution of the resulting designed component on the
inertial loads themselves)[8]. An application of this design
technique on a reported scenario leads to (significant
variations)[9] in the dimensions, mass of the designed components,
as well as the loads experienced by them.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> mechanical components that are subjected to dynamic loading in
their regular operation</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> typically parts moving at very high speeds such as parts of the IC
engine (connecting rod, piston), or Gas Turbine components (turbine).</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> artificially raising the level of the static load ; unknown
variations of the actual loads</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> For instance, lifts and buildings are designed typically with a
factor of safety of 100 over the expected static load of the people
and furniture, accounting for unknown dynamic loads due to earthquakes
or winds etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> dynamic component of the total loads are low</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> they are low when for instance people jump on a table, or say a
table fan rotating at very low speed. A factor of safety or 2-3 can
easily account for the dynamic component</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> not necessarily otherwise</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> The connecting rod of an IC engine is such a component where the
factor-of-safety (FOS) method will not work due the coupling between
inertia and mass. If you have more FOS, you will have more mass
leading to larger inertial loads, than what you wanted to compensate
for in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> upon a kinetostatic model</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> The angular velocity of the crank in an IC engine is constant</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> incorporates the effects of the mass distribution of the resulting
 designed component on the inertial loads themselves</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Mass distribution changes the inertial loads.  Effects of mass
distribution is taken into account by splitting the connecting rod
into 2 point masses and a varying I section. This mass distribution
has a different effect on the inertial loads as opposed to the
traditional 2 point-masses.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> significant variations</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> the mass reducing by 30%, the loads reducing by 50%</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The process of design of mechanical component usually starts with
(the identification of the loads on the component)[1], and (their
variations, if any, in the stipulated operating scenarios)[2]. In
(many cases, it is not possible to model the loads very
accurately)[3], (more so when they vary with time)[4]. In such
situations, it is customary to come up with a design based in
(available knowledge of load)[5], compensating for the undetermined
variations by introducing a ‚Äúfactor of safety‚Äù, which essentially
simulates a higher level of static load. This method, though used
fairly commonly, (is not guaranteed to produce the best results)[6],
particularly when the (dynamic loads are comparable/greater than the
static loads on a component)[7]. In such cases, (over-compensation
of the loads)[8] lead to heavier designs, which in turn result in
greater inertial loads for the same operational speeds. An
alternative design methodology could be to employ a (detailed
analysis of the mass distribution, strength and loading of
components)[9]. However, because of the (coupled nature of
these)[10], it is a challenging task in terms of both modeling and
as well as computational burden. Nevertheless, some components, such
as the connecting rod of an IC engine in an automotive,..</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> the identification of the loads on the component; their variations,
if any, in the stipulated operating scenarios</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> For an IC engine, we look at the torque the engine has to generate
and the forces at the joints (varying with time) of the piston, crank
and connecting rod.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> In many cases, it is not possible to model the loads very
accurately</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> With the IC engine, there are 3 main parts, resulting in roughly 10
forces. Solving for these forces is quite hard and computationally
intensive when we have the second order inertia terms. We settle for
lesser accuracy and simplify the model.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> modeling the loads accurately when they vary with time</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> If the loads vary with time you have to make atleast another 360 to 720
calculations for the case of the IC engine.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> it is customary to come up with a design based on the available
knowledge of load</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> We set the inertial terms to 0 and this makes computation faster
and straight-forward to get closed form solutions and design the parts.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> This method (FOS method) is not guaranteed to produce the best results</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> If you apply this to an IC engine, the parts designed are expected
to break.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> dynamic loads are comparable/greater than the static loads on a
component</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Dynamic loads are greater than static loads in Gas Turbines and IC
engines rotating at greater than 4000 rpm</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> over-compensation of the loads</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> To account for unknown variations, we take the static loads on a
table, say due to a man sitting on it, and then assume the
maximum load is going to be 3 times the static load and design the
table for that.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> detailed analysis of the mass distribution, strength and loading of
components</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> for example using Finite Element Methods</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> coupled nature of these</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> if you increase mass of the part the inertia increases, if the
inertia increases loads increase, if the loads increase the dimensions
increase/change, which have an effect on the mass</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually, in the analysis of a connecting rod, its mass is
substituted for by an (equivalent system of concentrated
masses)[1]. One thirds and two thirds of the mass are lumped at the
piston and the crank end of the connecting rod, respectively. Based
on the forces calculated, engine parts are designed for maximum
piston load or inertial load. This approach does not capture the
(true variation of the dynamic forces on the connecting rod, and
their effect on the piston pin)[2]. Another lumping model is
presented, where in the (connecting rod is divided into three
parts)[3]: two concentrated end-masses, and distributed central
part. The central part remains a rod with linearly varying I-section
along its longitudinal axis. The ends are modeled by a point of mass
each at their barycenter, such that the resultant moment of inertia
is equivalent to the original.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> equivalent system of concentrated masses</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> For example the connecting rod is simplified as follows: ‚ÄúOne
thirds and two thirds of the mass are lumped at the piston and the
crank end of the connecting rod, respectively.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> true variation of the dynamic forces on the connecting rod, and
their effect on the piston pin</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> The FOS method thinks that there is no fatigue loading on the
system within every cycle, where as in reality there is fatigue loading.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> connecting rod is divided into three parts</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚Äútwo concentrated end-masses, and distributed central part. The
central part remains rod with linearly varying I-section along its
longitudinal axis‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes, (a dynamic loading case is decomposed into a series of
static loading cases)[1] referred to as screen shots. This allows
for accounting for dynamic loads by (solving a simple static case
repeatedly)[2] and is called quasi-dynamic. Though this is adequate
for most cases, it becomes computationally expensive when (huge
computer models)[3] (Finite Element) are used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> a dynamic loading case is decomposed into a series of static
loading cases</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> The crank in an IC engine rotates 360 degrees. So for every degree
you can compute the forces as though the system was static</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> solving a simple static case repeatedly</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Solving the same set of equations for every degree of rotation of
the crank.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> huge computer models</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚ÄúModels using Finite Element Methods‚Äù: For the IC engine simulation
it could take upto 1 hr on a 8gb ram system per simulation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper proposes a new design paradigm that incorporates the
(effects of dynamic loading on a mechanical component)[1]. The loads
on the component are computed using a (kinetostatic analysis
model)[2], which is (simple and analytical in nature)[3], and
(significantly more accurate)[4] than the static model at the same
time. Using the example of the connecting rod of an IC engine, it
has been shown that there is a significant change in resulting
design when the proposed methodology is applied to an (existing
design scenario reported in literature)[5]. It is expected to
produce more realistic results as the (analysis and design modules
in each iteration, are refined further)[6].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> effects of dynamic loading on a mechanical component</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> such as the loads experienced by parts of an IC engine.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> kinetostatic analysis model</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> crank is assumed to have a constant speed.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> simple and analytical in nature</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> We don‚Äôt need to solve differential equations but solve simple
simultaneous equations</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> significantly more accurate</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> for example, the static load calculation does not capture the
cyclic loading and overestimates the forces</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> existing design scenario reported in literature</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> The formulas for stress, used to dimension the piston, connecting
rod and crank, based on loads</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> it is expected to produce more realistic results as the analysis
and design modules in each iteration, (are refined further)</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> For instance, if the mass distribution of the parts resulting in
better estimates of the inertial load improve, then we should have
more realistic results.</p>

<h3 id="article-by-paul-graham-on-writing-16">Article by Paul Graham on writing (16)</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html">PG‚Äôs writing on ‚ÄúWriting, Briefly‚Äù</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think it‚Äôs far more important to (write well)[1] than most people
realize. Writing doesn‚Äôt just (communicate ideas)[2]; it (generates
them)[3]. If you‚Äôre (bad at writing)[4] and don‚Äôt like to do it,
you‚Äôll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> write well; generates ideas</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Writing that generates ideas and clarifies thought implies that you
are writing well. For example, I was writing an article on my career
choices and found that it didn‚Äôt make much of a difference to me to
save 600 lives as opposed to 500 lives. I was looking at them like
they were ‚Ç¨‚Äôs. It was during this writing that discovered for myself
about how wrong I was.</p>

<p>I was constantly worrying myself about how I couldn‚Äôt save 10k lives
while I was treating the difference between 500 and 600 lives as meh!
It was with this article, when I was writing it, that I understood why
even a 100 lives is nothing short of incredible.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> communicate ideas</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> PG writes blogs after blogs to share his ideas with people, ideas
on how to write, how a business plan should look, etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> bad at writing</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Writing that does not communicate ideas or generate them would be
considered bad writing. If you look at <a href="/Answers-finale.html">this article</a> on the
purpose of life you will get an idea of what I am talking about. I
wrote it a while back based on the discussion I had with an STM, but
boy, I had to turn my head away while I was looking at it
recently. It‚Äôs all over the place, needs some major re-writing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As for how to write well, here‚Äôs the short version: Write a bad
version 1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut out
everything unnecessary; write in a conversational tone; develop a
nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours; imitate
writers you like; if you can‚Äôt get started, tell someone what you
plan to write about, then write down what you said; expect 80% of
the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50%
of those you start with to be wrong; be confident enough to cut;
have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which bits are
confusing or drag; don‚Äôt (always) make detailed outlines; mull ideas
over for a few days before writing; carry a small notebook or scrap
paper with you; start writing when you think of the first sentence;
if a deadline forces you to start before that, just say the most
important sentence first; write about stuff you like; don‚Äôt try to
sound impressive; don‚Äôt hesitate to change the topic on the fly; use
footnotes to contain digressions; use anaphora to knit sentences
together; read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble
over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the paragraphs
you dread reading); try to tell the reader something new and useful;
work in fairly big quanta of time; when you restart, begin by
rereading what you have so far; when you finish, leave yourself
something easy to start with; accumulate notes for topics you plan
to cover at the bottom of the file; don‚Äôt feel obliged to cover any
of them; write for a reader who won‚Äôt read the essay as carefully as
you do, just as pop songs are designed to sound ok on crappy car
radios; if you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately; ask
friends which sentence you‚Äôll regret most; go back and tone down
harsh remarks; publish stuff online, because an audience makes you
write more, and thus generate more ideas; print out drafts instead
of just looking at them on the screen; use simple, germanic words;
learn to distinguish surprises from digressions; learn to recognize
the approach of an ending, and when one appears, grab it.</p>

<p>E1: For my summary on <a href="/deliberate-practice.html">Talent Is Overrated</a>, I wrote a rough version
in 5 hrs[1] followed by 3 editions of the same text taking 8 hrs, 4
hrs and then 45 mins respectively[2]. The rough version has spelling
mistakes, formatting errors, lots of text dump. I reduced the word
count drastically (30 to 50%) by the final edition [3].</p>

<p>For example‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Bad version 1</strong> The purpose of life is to save people because that is
what you want to do. Imagine you are walking on the street and see a
baby floating in the water (i.e., a massive chance of dying), wouldn‚Äôt
you save it?  Now think of a child in Africa who is starving, boy that
mothafreaker is hungry as hell for so 5 days and no one is able to
help him, he is a fucking kid, and here you are deciding which phone
to buy and worrying about it. I was recently starving my ass off and
very much needed food but would have to go through some tasks before
getting to it, imagine being like that every single time. What should
you do with your money again?</p>

<p><strong>First rewrite</strong>
The purpose of life is to save as many people as possible, in the
present and in the future. The value of life is X, saving nX lives
gets you n times the value.</p>

<p>Imagine the pain of starving. I very badly wanted to eat at 4 pm one
day. but I had to weight-train and then do some strenuous cardio and
then go back somewhere and find my food and heat it up. It was 7pm. I
was pushing every ounce of motivation towards keeping me upright and
finishing my work. A starving child in Africa has to starve more than
often. All you have to do is not eat that chocolate, or not eat
outside and he could eat a glorious meal. How could I be justified in
eating a chocolate while an innocent kid for no fault of his starves.</p>

<p><strong>Second re-write</strong></p>

<p>I have 10$ and I have the option to allow an innocent kid far far away
to starve (a kid who has probably been starving for atleast a meal
before) or go to a nice Indian restaurant. The choice is simple in‚Äôit?
What should I be doing again?</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong></p>

  <p>write in a conversational tone;[4]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> I think this means, write like you talk. The following is an example.</p>

<p>Uff!</p>

<p><strong>Writing like your talking!</strong>
Traditionally such design tasks are handled by artificially raising
the level of the static load, i.e., factor of safety design. This is
expected to compensate for the variations in the actual load.</p>

<p>Much better I think! Ok, So do not write ridiculously long
sentences. Speak what you want to write inside your head and then
write it.</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> An exercise like <a href="http://pradeep90.github.io/deliberate-practice.html">this</a>, ‚Äúdeliberate practice for writing‚Äù, shows
how to develop a nose for good and bad writing and how to fix it. In
the process you end up imitating the writers you like as you use their
work as reference.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin took the Spectator and made notes of it. After a few
days, re-wrote them in his own words, compared his work to the
original, and understood what all he could do better. He focused on

etc‚Ä¶ This he did many many times to become ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs first great

<p><strong>E:</strong> I don‚Äôt work on essays or even data science if I have less than 2

for [12] either.</p>

<p>In the last essay on <a href="/DP-CT-examples.html">DP</a>, I was following the Benjamin Franklin
method and trying to find out how I compared to an essay written by an
STM. I was writing some final words, when I jumped out of my way to
write about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unconscious consistency</code>. It was nice for me to understand
that separately, but it didn‚Äôt fit in the context and I put it in as a
note. This seems like a digression[11].</p>

<p>In the essay on my <a href="/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html">Career-Research</a>, I was calculating the impact
due to various careers and saw that there was a difference of
sometimes a 100 people, and I didn‚Äôt pay too much care for it, but
realized while writing further that I was valuing the life of 100
people much much less than what they were worth. This was a surprising
insight[11].</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/R8cpqD3NA4rZxRdQ4/availability">EY‚Äôs blog on Availability Bias</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The availability heuristic is (judging the frequency or probability
of an event, by the ease with which examples of the event come to
mind)[1].</p>

  <p>A famous 1978 study by Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, and
Combs, ‚ÄúJudged Frequency of Lethal Events‚Äù, (studied errors in
quantifying the severity of risks, or judging which of two dangers
occurred more frequently)[2]. Subjects thought that accidents caused
about as many deaths as disease; thought that homicide was a more
frequent cause of death than suicide. Actually, diseases cause about
16 times as many deaths as accidents, and suicide is twice as
frequent as homicide.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>An obvious hypothesis to account for these skewed beliefs is that
murders are more likely to be talked about than suicides - thus,
someone is more likely to recall hearing about a murder than hearing
about a suicide. Accidents are more dramatic than diseases - perhaps
this makes people more likely to remember, or more likely to recall,
an accident. In 1979, a followup study by Combs and Slovic showed
that the skewed probability judgments correlated strongly (.85 and
.89) with skewed reporting frequencies in two newspapers.  This
doesn‚Äôt disentangle whether murders are more available to memory
because they are more reported-on, or whether newspapers report more
on murders because murders are more vivid (hence also more
remembered). But either way, an availability bias is at work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> judging the frequency or probability of an event, by the ease with
which examples of the event come to mind</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> (paraphrasing) ‚Äú According to a study there was a high correlation

  <p>(Selective reporting is one major source of availability biases)[1].
In the ancestral environment, much of what you knew, you experienced
yourself; or you heard it directly from a fellow tribe-member who
had seen it. There was usually at most one layer of selective
reporting between you, and the event itself. With today‚Äôs Internet,
you may see reports that have passed through the hands of six
bloggers on the way to you - six successive filters. Compared to our
ancestors, we live in a larger world, in which far more happens, and
far less of it reaches us - a much stronger selection effect, which
can create much larger availability biases.</p>

to selective reporting by the media, you may be tempted to compare
your life success to his - and suffer hedonic penalties accordingly.

that exponential increases in scope create linear increases in

  <p>Sketch of a business plan for Webgen. 24 Aug 95.</p>

  <p>OVERVIEW</p>

  <p>Webgen allows clients to generate (web catalogs)[1] remotely.</p>

  <p>There are (several other companies that can generate and serve web
catalogs)[2]. The best known site of this type is Marketplace MCI
(www.internetmci.com). But while these other sites use their
generators in-house to build catalogs from materials provided by
clients, Webgen‚Äôs generator can be used interactively by anyone with
a modem and a copy of Netscape.</p>

  <p>This will (lower the cost)[3] of putting a catalog online by, say,
90%. It also means that our (volume is not limited by the number of
clients we can serve personally)[4]. We would be a (software
company)[5], (not a service company)[6].</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> web catalogs [1]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> a catalog of products like <a href="https://www.festo.com/cat/en-us_us/products">this?</a></p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> several other companies that can generate and serve web catalogs [2]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚ÄúMarketplace MCI (www.internetmci.com)</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> lower the cost [3]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚Äúby 90%‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Volume is not limited by the number of clients we can serve
personally.[4]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Alphabet serves billions of people, where as Mckinsey serves a
limited number of clients. Alphabet is not limited by the number of
clients they can serve personally.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Software company [5]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Accenture, IBM</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Service company [6]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> MarketplaceMCI, Mckinsey</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone will be able to sign up to keep a catalog at our site for a
flat monthly fee. And we have made Webgen (so easy to use)[1] that
any graphic designer or ‚Äúweb consultant‚Äù can generate catalogs with
it. So instead of approaching catalog companies with an offer to put
their catalog on the web, we will let them do it themselves.</p>

  <p>Suppose you are running (a catalog company)[2]. Today, if you want to
have (an online catalog that people can order from)[3], you have two
options. You can have a company like MCI create and serve it for
you, or you can set up your own server. Both options are
expensive. When our service goes online for real, (you will be able
to do it in-house)[4]: anyone who can use Netscape can generate catalogs
at Webgen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> So easy to use [1]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚Äúany graphic designer or ‚Äúweb consultant‚Äù can generate catalogs‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> a catalog company [2]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> similar to Amazon, flipkart</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> an online catalog that people can order from [3]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Amazon and flipkart, where you can see and buy from.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> do it in-house [4]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚Äúanyone who can use netscape can generate catalogs at Webgen‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(There are a large number of companies who would like to be able to
market products on the web)[1], (if it were cheaper and easier)[2]. To our
knowledge, Webgen is the <em>only</em> system that can tap this market.</p>

  <p>As the market matures, we would consider spinning off a standalone
catalog generator/server as a commercial product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Large number of companies who would like to able to market products
online [1]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Have a look at amazon; books, furniture, clothes, food etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚Äú90% cheaper than others, and a graphic designer being able to do
it‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HOW BIG A DEAL IS WEBGEN?</p>

  <p>Even (assuming it succeeds)[1], what are the prospects for Webgen? How
big a role in the future of the Internet will a company like Webgen
play?</p>

  <p>The answer, perhaps surprisingly, seems to be: (a very big
role)[2]. (Technical people and business people)[3] agree, the web is going
to be important. A large part of the web‚Äôs importance will come from
online commerce. And Webgen could, in turn, be involved in a large
part of the online commerce.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> assuming if it succeeds [1]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> if the company makes profits or if the company is capable of
sustaining itself</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> a very big role[2]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚ÄúA large part of web‚Äôs importance will come from online
commerce. And Webgen could, in turn, be involved in a large part of
the online commerce.‚Äù ( as it is currently the only easy-to-use
generator)</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Technical people and business people [3]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> No examples are given, out of scope of this essay.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why? Forget about Webgen for a moment, and just ask: what will the
(future of online commerce look like)[1]? (When someone wants to sell
things on the Web, how will they do it)[2]? At the moment, they can
either go to a company like MCI, or set up their own server. But
what will they do a year or two from now? Ten years from now?</p>

  <p>(If selling things online were like other software applications, the
future of the market would be general-purpose software packages)[3]. You
would eventually be able to buy a copy of Microsoft Catalog, and use
that to put your catalog online.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are a couple reasons why this is not likely to happen anytime
soon. The main problem is, (an online catalog is not just something
that happens on your own computer)[4], like word-processing. It has to
be on a web server, with encrypted transactions, a high-bandwidth
network connection, 100% uptime, security, backups, order tracking,
and so on. (Setting up a server is expensive and difficult)[5]. On the
East coast, the network connection alone costs about $2000/mo.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the next best solution is to have a (general-purpose catalog

Catalog, or as close as anything‚Äôs going to get. Don‚Äôt be led astray
by the fact that the software is going to run on our machines. (With

  <p>Of course, (really high-end customers will want to set up their own

own photos. We would not rule out setting up clones of Webgen for
them. But we believe that we will be more successful if we think of
ourselves as (selling a product)[2] rather than (a

  <p>No one likes schleps, but hackers especially (dislike them)[5]. Most

with other companies, or deal with other people‚Äôs broken code. Maybe
that‚Äôs possible, but I haven‚Äôt seen it.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> great startup ideas</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Dropbox, ASML, Paypal, Tesla (greatness measured by success)</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under our noses</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> perhaps an NGO that works with the government to provide free or
dirt cheap extensive health care for all in need</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> tedious, unpleasant task</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> I am discouraged to pursue starting up as there is so much
unpleasant uncertainty, it will probably not happen within my
lifetime; you have to penetrate your vision into the government
SOMEHOW; you need to make deals; you need to followup; there will be
power changes; I need to have the right skill before I take it up
etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>E2:</strong> I worked in a company where there were 40 designers sharing one
license for part of software. Not many people used it often but when I
needed it I always had to beg around and ask for it and waste quite
some time. To fix it I would need to talk to a few people who have the
problem, escalate it to the VP of the company and keep following it up
for months before I see any follow up. So, I didn‚Äôt. I just left it as
I was somehow able to finish my work. Then it happened again. I
escalated it. This time I didn‚Äôt follow it up though. #schleps</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> people dislike schleps</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> I guess the one thing that is stopping me from pursuing starting or
joining an NGO to support healthcare for the poor, is all the work
that I need to do, right from my education, to handling uncertainty of
such an initiative (mainly coming from schleps?)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers about
(the inevitability of schleps)[6]. No, you can‚Äôt start a startup by just
writing code. I remember going through this realization
myself. There was a point in 1995 when I was still trying to
convince myself I could start a company by just writing code. But I
soon learned from experience that schleps are not merely inevitable,
but pretty much what business consists of. A company is defined by
the schleps it will undertake. And schleps should be dealt with the
same way you‚Äôd deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in. Which
is not to say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, but that
you should (never shrink from it if it‚Äôs on the path to something
great.)[7]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> the inevitability of schleps</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Buying groceries has schleps (you need to go there, stand in que),
buying groceries online has schleps (you freaking need to be home for
2 hrs to collect it),</p>

<p>I want to be able to clock hours after hours in the silent room in
the library. But guess what, I need to cook, I need to pack my work in
bags, unfreeze the food for the next day, clean plates, buy the
missing ingredients from stores that close before 10pm. Schleps is
everywhere.</p>

<p>You want to find another house where the roof doesn‚Äôt creek and is in
the same city of your work? #Schleps. You need to find someone for
your current place, you need to find a new place within the Budget,
you need to spend hours on the website.</p>

<p>Schleps got to be done.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> never shrink from it if it‚Äôs on the path to something great</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> You still need to eat, live in a space of mental peace. So you need
to put in the work of cooking, storing the food and finding a roof
above your head that allows you to sleep on time etc‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much
of it is unconscious. (Your unconscious won‚Äôt even let you see ideas
that involve painful schleps)[8]. That‚Äôs schlep blindness.</p>

  <p>The phenomenon isn‚Äôt limited to startups. Most people don‚Äôt
consciously decide not to be in as good physical shape as Olympic
athletes, for example. Their unconscious mind decides for them,
shrinking from the work involved.</p>

schleps</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ‚ÄúMost people don‚Äôt consciously decide not to be in as good physical
shape as Olympic athletes, for example. Their unconscious mind decides
for them, shrinking from the work involved.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>E2:</strong> I freaking don‚Äôt go to a phisio but complain to myself for the
last 3-5 months everytime I go to the gym because of
#schleps. Wow. The Schleps though is that I keep a schedule and I hate
it if it gets disturbed, I have to call the phisio during the schedule
(‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time you see‚Äù)</p>

<p>E3: Fat caliper allows to calculate the muscle mass and fat%, my
unconscious has decided <em>not to give</em> me this feedback as it is a schlep
that I have to do every Monday night for about 10-15 mins</p>

<p>E4: It helps to stretch leg muscles before and after strenuous
cardio. It is a schlep, and I have schlep blindness.</p>

<p>E5: I suspect not many people donate and it‚Äôs schlep blindness. Once a
year we have the opportunity to donate 10$ from the company or get
gifts for it instead. A large number of people chose gifts. It appears
that their unconscious has decided for them shrinking from the schlep
(aka, having to forgo a bag of gifts).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The (most striking example)[9] I know of schlep blindness is Stripe, or
rather Stripe‚Äôs idea. For over a decade, every hacker who‚Äôd ever had
to process payments online knew how painful the experience
was. Thousands of people must have known about this problem. And yet
when they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or
aggregators for local events. Why? Why work on problems few care
much about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the
most important components of the world‚Äôs infrastructure? Because
schlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea of
fixing payments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> most striking example</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Stripe took the hardest problem (considering schleps), and
solved it despite so many people having the same problem</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe site
began by asking ‚Äúshould we fix payments, or build a recipe site?‚Äù
and chose the recipe site. (Though the idea of fixing payments was
right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because their
unconscious mind shrank from the complications involved)[10]. You‚Äôd have
to make deals with banks. How do you do that? Plus you‚Äôre moving
money, so you‚Äôre going to have to deal with fraud, and people trying
to break into your servers. Plus there are probably all sorts of
regulations to comply with. It‚Äôs a lot more intimidating to start a
startup like this than a recipe site.</p>

<p>Tesla is pioneering the way of the future and has only one other
serious competitor</p>

  <p>How do you (overcome schlep blindness)[1]? Frankly, (the most valuable
antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance)[2]. Most successful
founders would probably say that if they‚Äôd known when they were
starting their company about the obstacles they‚Äôd have to overcome,
they might never have started it. Maybe that‚Äôs one reason the most
successful startups of all so often have young founders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> overcome schlep blindness</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Starting Tesla, Starting Space X, Starting Stripe irrespective of
the schleps</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> the most valuable antidote to schlep blindness is probably
ignorance</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> If Elon Musk knew the type of problems he would face such as
constant backlash with investors, the uncertainty of the company
existing every single day, constantly being scrutinized by the public
and having to stay at work 24x7 while accelerating the progress of
humanity, he probably wouldn‚Äôt have started it.(bold claim, please
read with caution)</p>

<p>2 people from Indian Institute of Technology started Ather Energy,
which is similar in concept to Tesla but for India and they are for
bikes, not cars. When the two founders started they didn‚Äôt have a
strong idea of what all they needed to tackle; how to handle the
problem of charging the vehicles; how to sell the product; are people
going to even buy it; is there a market for it; who is going to fund
such an idea; What about competing with other vehicles etc‚Ä¶ Atleast
they were not too concerned with it. All they wanted to do was build
electric vehicles. The city needed a better class of electric vehicles
and they were going to give it. Period.</p>

<p>Initially they wanted to come up with battery swap. The logistical
nightmare it would be, was ridiculous. He had some ideas of tackling
it, like running pilot tests, but was not really worried about
it. Ignorance? I think so. They had no vision of the hurdles they had
to cross to put an e-bike on the market.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In practice the (founders grow with the problems)[1]. But no one seems
able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders. So
the reason younger founders have an advantage is that (they make two
mistakes that cancel each other out)[2]. They don‚Äôt know how much they
can grow, but they also don‚Äôt know how much they‚Äôll need to. Older
founders only make the first mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> founders grow with problems</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> The founders have no previous history of managing anything. Both
were extremely technical people. Today Ather Energy is killing it,
having been backed by some of the biggest giants in the industry,
attempting to revolutionize e-bikes in a country like India. Every
single problem I talked about, they seem to have grown to handle
it. For example, if people need to charge their bikes, they decided to
give them charging stations with quick charging in several
locations. They introduced a bunch of features using smart phones to
locate them and check if the stations are free. They have started this
already in Banglore and are trying to expand to other cities.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> They (young founders) make two mistakes that cancel each other out</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> They don‚Äôt know how much they can grow, but they also don‚Äôt know
how much they‚Äôll need to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Ignorance can‚Äôt solve everything though)[1]. (Some ideas so
obviously entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them)[2]. How
do you see ideas like that? The trick I recommend is to (take
yourself out of the picture)[3]. Instead of asking (‚Äúwhat problem
should I solve?‚Äù ask ‚Äúwhat problem do I wish someone else would
solve for me?‚Äù)[4] If someone who had to process payments before
Stripe had tried asking that, Stripe would have been one of the
first things they wished for.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs too late now to be Stripe, (but there‚Äôs plenty still broken in
the world, if you know how to see it)[5].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> ignorance can‚Äôt solve everything though; Some ideas so obviously
entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them; take yourself out of
the picture; what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> After the company matured a bit, Ather Energy knew that no one
would come forward to providing charging stations. Without Charging
stations infrastructure, their product was going to fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/iecq6vSr-EQ?t=1399">It was a
chicken and egg problem. The infrastructure companies would have to
see enough demand to provide charging stations, and only if there are
enough charging stations, the company making e-bikes could
survive.</a> So they decided to take that on as well. Ather Grid.</p>

<p>Ask not what I should solve, ask what problem do I wish someone else
would solve for me! This way you see without the schleps.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> but there‚Äôs plenty still broken in the world</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> For some of the hottest problems look <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/">no further than here</a></p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>I am happy about most of the work, except the technical writing. I
constantly felt it was really bad. For example‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>P:</strong> modeling the loads accurately when they vary with time</p>

  <p><strong>E:</strong> If the loads vary with time you have to make atleast another 360 to 720
calculations for the case of the IC engine.</p>

  <p><strong>P:</strong> it is customary to come up with a design based on the available
knowledge of load</p>

  <p><strong>E:</strong> We set the inertial terms to 0 and this makes computation faster
and straight-forward to get closed form solutions and design the
parts.</p>

  <p><strong>P:</strong> over-compensation of the loads</p>

  <p><strong>E:</strong> To account for unknown variations, we take the static loads on a
table, say due to a man sitting on it, and then assume the
maximum load is going to be 3 times the static load and design the
table for that.</p>

  <p><strong>P:</strong> detailed analysis of the mass distribution, strength and loading of
components</p>

  <p><strong>E:</strong> for example using Finite Element Methods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know in all these cases atleast there needs some more work from my
side, as I do not explain the connection between the phrase and the
example at all.</p>

<p>I like what I did for schlep blindness, particularly here where I
attempt imho some decent examples:</p>

  <p><strong>P:</strong> Your unconscious won‚Äôt even let you see ideas that involve painful
schleps</p>

  <p><strong>E:</strong> ‚ÄúMost people don‚Äôt consciously decide not to be in as good physical
shape as Olympic athletes, for example. Their unconscious mind decides
for them, shrinking from the work involved.‚Äù</p>

  <p><strong>E2:</strong> I freaking don‚Äôt go to a phisio but complain to myself for the
last 3-5 months everytime I go to the gym because of
#schleps. Wow. The Schleps though is that I keep a schedule and I hate
it if it gets disturbed, I have to call the phisio during the schedule
(‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time you see‚Äù)</p>

  <p><strong>E3:</strong> Fat caliper allows to calculate the muscle mass and fat%, my
unconscious has decided <em>not to give</em> me this feedback as it is a schlep
that I have to do every Monday night for about 10-15 mins</p>

  <p>E4: It helps to stretch leg muscles before and after strenuous
cardio. It is a schlep, and I have schlep blindness.</p>

  <p>E5: I suspect not many people donate and it‚Äôs schlep blindness. Once a
year we have the opportunity to donate 10$ from the company or get
gifts for it instead. A large number of people chose gifts. It appears
that their unconscious has decided for them shrinking from the schlep
(aka, having to forgo a bag of gifts).</p>

<p><strong>Total:</strong> 29 hrs</p>

<p><strong>DP:</strong> ~20 hrs

<p><strong>Day 1:</strong> 3 hrs work and 1.2 hrs break in between</p>

<p>Lot of yawning, trying to figure out which articles to pick. If I keep
typing then I tend to get bored less. The last one hr was hard. I roughly did about 10 examples an hour.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2:</strong> 5 hrs work and 2 hrs break in between</p>

<p>I understood the real task at hand and how overwhelming it was going
to be to do 200 phrases. I realize I am trying to eat more than I can
chew. I come back after basketball (very rare event) to clock another
hour. I feel more serious. I am saying to myself, this is how it
should be, grinding at top speed and not anything slower. IT IS
SUPPOSED TO BE PAINFUL! ONLY THEN YOU ARE MAXING OUT. IT IS NOT
SUPPOSED TO FEEL GOOD. Inshallah! #Indha-vali-puduchurku!</p>

<p>38 phrases done by day 2.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3:</strong> 6 hrs work and 1.2 hrs break in between</p>

<p>Feeling frustrated that I am unable to come up with examples in some
cases. This is hard bro!</p>

<p>Wanted to go all the way till 150 somehow but couldn‚Äôt, got stuck at
100 phrases.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4:</strong> 7 hrs work and 2 hrs break in between</p>

<p>Went all the way till 150 phrases.</p>

<p><strong>Day 5:</strong> 8.5 hrs work and 2.5 hrs of break</p>

<p>As for my last day, I am tired as fuck, I don‚Äôt have much energy in
me. I know I didn‚Äôt do all the 200, but I did 170-175. I tried my
best. I am sorry! Cheers!</p>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong> I had most of the time in the day to work on this as I
don‚Äôt have to work now. I went to the gym or did cardio in the
evenings on most days. Usually started work by 10:30 am and went on
till the night with other activities such as rest, gym and eating
food.</p>

<p><strong>On all days I slept for half hour after lunch!</strong> Like hand on the
table and closing my eyes and waking up naturally.</p>

<!-- Day 2: -->

<!-- Managed 2*1.5 hr sessions roughly. But quite daunting. thinking of -->

<!-- And feeling frustrated that sometimes I cannot come up with examples! -->

<!-- Day 4:  -->

<!-- Slept for half hour after lunch, 1 hr lunch and video watching.  -->

<!-- Working on PG article allowed to bump score decently today. Was hard -->
<!-- sometimes, but most was nice to work on (comfort zone) -->
