<p>Marriage is a social construct where a man marries a woman(/man). In countries like India it is the norm, whereas in european countries we do have couples who do not marry for a long time and have kids even.</p>

<p>Google defines it as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>the legally or formally recognized union of two people as partners in a personal relationship</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see that my mind has already been made up, primarily for the reasons, that I have other important things to focus on and I am not ready to invest in something that is going to bring my goal down. For me it is very important to make lots of money, and focus on my career. What ever I need to do for that, I am ready to do. I am least bit interested in spending money of any magnitude. With marriage comes a women in your life, who might seem to buy useless things, who might want to have a kid/kids. Kids are fucking cute but only at times. They can be a real pain( for example, me to my parents). They will not listen to you. They are going to do what they want. Now is it worth spending huge amounts of money for education and food, for me to the tune of 46000 euros, to get what my parents got? I am not going to marry, I don’t listen to my parents on most matters. I will do what I fucking want. Now, How has that worked for them.</p>

<p>As the movies portray it might be great to have kids, but I have seen kids first hand. Its a lot of work, its a lot of time investment. When there are so many important problems to solve in this world, why unnecessarily bring more problems for you.</p>

<p>For example, instead of spending 40000 Euros on your kids, you could use it to save ‘I dont know how many fucking lives’. Period.
Did you know primary schools cost 2 to 3k Euros in India? Why would I unnecessarily- having seen a lot of parents in my life- get myself into this bullshit. I have no interest in starting a family. I have my parents, my brother and a whole lot of friends and cousins. These many people are good. Here me out loud, I am not opposed to the concept of girlfriend, but marriage, and making a life long commitment, so that the girl feels secure with half of your earnings at divorce, Sorry! Not my cup of milk!</p>

<p>If you really have not a better thing to do in life and choose to “settle down” and marry, good luck bruv.</p>

<p>You dont have any problems when you are at 35 now. But suddenly because you are married, you already have shit loads of problems at 35. For me if I loose my job, I pretty much don’t care. I will go back to india, stay with my parents, try to find something that works for me. But if I am married, I better be worried sick every second of my life that that doesn’t happen.</p>

<p>I suspect it will possibly be hard to live the lifestyle in the way I want, especially with a marriage. Anyways, Why am I convincing you of this ridiculous construct, You should be trying to convince me for it.</p>

<p>Enough of this bullshit. What do the probabilities say again?</p>
