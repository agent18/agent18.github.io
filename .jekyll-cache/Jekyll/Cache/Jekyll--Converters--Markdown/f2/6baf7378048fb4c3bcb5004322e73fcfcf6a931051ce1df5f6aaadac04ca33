I"Ê"<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I am most likely going to be single and unmarried at retirement say
58-60 years of age. I was evaluating my career options and wanted to
see how they would be affected in case I choose one of them. The
careers that I am considering is either Management Consulting or Data
Science/Software Engineering.</p>

<p>Until 60 is not really the problem, atleast I am not worried about
it. But after that I have no idea what I am about to do?</p>

<h2 id="fears-of-old-age">Fears of old age</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Loneliness</li>
  <li>not being able to take care of myself (parkinsons, alzeimers)</li>
  <li>boredom</li>
  <li>finances</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finances">Finances</h3>

<p>I do not think I will ever have a problem with finances. I believe the
current job I am in will be the minimum I can do. Basic amenities will
always be taken care of post my work phase. I will get a good enough
pension from which ever country I am in and I will settle down in
India, if it makes economical sense and I am not able to work anymore.</p>

<h3 id="loneliness">Loneliness</h3>

<p>Are loneliness and boredom the same thing? I will roll with this. I
imagine this thing, that after I retire, I will be bored and lonely. I
will not know what to do. I want to address this.</p>

<p>How do I keep myself occupied and entertained? During my work life
(30-60/70), I clock 40 hours or greater with a seeming purpose, how
will I fill my time after retiring. How will I engage in flow after 60?</p>

<p><strong>Physically able</strong></p>

<p>I expect to be in the best physical shape as I can be when I
am 60. Just like <a href="http://scoobysworkshop.com/">Scooby</a>. Scooby not only does body building, but
also provides bodybuilding advice on the internet via his website and
YouTube channel. He is also building his own plane and bikes across
different countries from time to time.</p>

<p>He is one such example where after 60 can still be quite
entertaining. With my limited knowledge of life and the understanding
of motivation, I think I can a life like that of Scoobysâ€™ is what I
should have as an aim.</p>

<p>Physically I see not much problem with me being active like Scooby
after 60. I am working hard on my fitness and will continue to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Engaging in flow</strong></p>

<p>In all probability I will retire to India and I see a boom in people
playing badminton. There are tons of courts here and people ready to
teach you for real cheap prices and people learning to play the sport
at all different ages. Other than my gym, I would like to invest in
something like badminton, to help me keep active and engage in
flow.</p>

<p>As long as I have something to do with Data Science or Software
Engineering during my entire life, I tend to think post-work-life as
continuing to contribute to the open source community, writing
programs of all kinds. Take <a href="https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/">Jblevins</a> for example, this is how I
imagine even post-work-life to be. Writing new softwares all the time,
engaging in long coding outbursts until I am physically unwell. The
act of writing programs and hosting it on your github page seems to be
quite satisfying, if you are a moderately experienced programmer. I
think when I am with Data Science or Software Engineering I will be
able to have a much better life which is fulfilled.</p>

<p>But it looks like the odds are that I will not be working with writing
programs for the main part of my job. There is a high chance that I
will have some experience in doing it in the nascent years of my
career but not for the major part say 25-30 years. I think I will
always end up in management on a high level. In most of my career
options such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Data Science with a focus on
Effective-Altruism-Organizations</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Management Consulting with a
focus on becoming partner</code>, I doubt that I will have much time to do
things other than working out, eating healthy, improving my career and
say blogging.</p>

<p>My father works on shares for example, from 9-5. He invests about
30000$ and spends most of his time working on it.</p>

<p>Musicians and flow. Slightly pricy hobby.</p>

<p>Blogging.</p>

<p>There are some options that I should push myself into. A career in
Effective-Altruism-Organization or Consulting seems to not help much
in gaining the above skills. But these are the best suited careers for
me to make my greatest impact over the long term. I should stick to
these careers and try to focus on things I can do on the side.</p>

<p>I.E., in all likelihood I would just be a healthy, incapable of
learning new things, without a partner (not that it is life
changing).</p>

<p>When I am in Management consulting I am not sure how my skills will
continue to be valid</p>

<p>Blogging
working out
playing sport
post-work-life
writing programs</p>

<h3 id="finances-1">Finances</h3>

<p>Working at an Effective-Altruism-Organization</p>

<p>Not working at an Effective-Altruism-Organization</p>

<p>Pension</p>

<p>Moving to India?</p>

<h3 id="physically-unable">Physically unable</h3>

<p>As said earlier, there is a very high chance that I would be
single. In case I have diseases like Parkinsons and need someone to
take care of me in a 1st world country might be really pricy. I should
probably move to a 3rd world country and join something like a home
having a paid a huge sum of money.</p>

<p>Anything can happen. My one stop solution is to save enough money and
put it in the bank so that I have some emergency funds growing over
time to take care of me in case I become really sick. I will also have
my pension which will support me as needed.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t really see the point of getting married as the costs of a
marriage would simply outweigh the costs of getting taken care of
including a probability. A marriage can get you kids and wife who will
inturn hire someone to take care of you, if you hire a middle man,
then to take care of you. Your wife could die or you could be stuck in
service for her. If you think your wife will help you out, yeah maybe,
but there also a chance that she could be dead. Removing all the
middle men and the costs to produce them, considering I can always be
in India when the time comes to take care of myself, hire a personnel
or join a home. Kids could also be dicks (2% chance) and not see you
that often.</p>

<p>The cost of a marriage is simply put atleast 20lack Rs (30k$).
Achieving flow is something that I should constantly keep working on
with a focus for later.</p>

<p>Yes love and all that stuff is nice to have
at that age,</p>

<h2 id="finances-before-and-after-60">Finances before and after 60</h2>

<p>I am not too worried about finances. I will get some money and
property after the death of my parents. I will save 15% of my
salary. I am not struggling for decent money now and I donâ€™t think I
will as long as I am able to work hard and put effort into staying
healthy.</p>

<h2 id="health-before-and-after-60">Health before and after 60</h2>

<p>I have great healthcare right now and I will invest in great
healthcare to take care of all the unforseen things like cancer. I
excercise regulary and eat healthy when I am working out and hope to
be in great shape even at the age of 55, just like brad pitt, tom
cruise and Scooby.</p>

<p>Until 60 I am not too worried.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-yourself-occupied">Keeping yourself occupied</h2>

<p>Right now I find work to give me purpose to give me challenging
problems to work on every single day. It consumes 40 hours of my week
peacefully and what am I going to do during retirement?</p>

<p>What if I feel lonely?</p>

<p>I guess that a sense of purpose can keep in alive, when you have tons
of work to do?</p>

<p>I want to be like scooby, travel the world for cheap, bike through
regions and regions at 60. Be active and stay healthy.</p>

<p>What if I need help doing things like going to the toilet?</p>

<p>What if I get parkinsons disease or aleimers?</p>

<p><strong>Money</strong></p>

<p>With enough savings, I should be able to reasonably take care of
myself</p>
