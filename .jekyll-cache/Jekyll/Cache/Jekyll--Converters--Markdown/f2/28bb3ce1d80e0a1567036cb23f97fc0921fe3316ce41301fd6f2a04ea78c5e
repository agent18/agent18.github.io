<p>Concrete thinking, career, Goal,</p>

<p><strong>Health</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Why do you workout? why do you spend 12 hrs a week on this? How do
you keep log? laptop or paper? What do you do when there is no improvement?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cardio what do you do? 20 mins a day? isn‚Äôt cardio boring? or hard?
For example, I don‚Äôt want to cycle, treadmil is ok!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ergonomics: I don‚Äôt care about it at all</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Veganism, I am not sure what is my impact and what is my cost! It
was a loose statement I made. I am not vegan‚Ä¶ I eat paneer from
hotels easily.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Why concrete thinking? Venezuala example, ‚Äúhightech industries are
showing high profits‚Äù</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>That is better than them just reading the labels and nodding their

    <p>How many hours should I do? How to count DP hrs (days of deadline

  <li>
    <p>How do I get immediate feedback while DPing? example!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seeing progress and feedback (discuss how it happens now and plans
to amend?)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Following all this, one can work on his technique but it very
important to see progress and get feedback. Otherwise one will stop
getting any better and stop caring about the end goal. Feedback is
extremely crucial to feel motivated. Sometimes results might need
interpretation, trusting your own judgment might not really be the
best way to go about it. Is the blog post clear to a new reader? Will
people get the main idea? Is it organized well? Paul Graham for
example, appears to take this very seriously. Before he publishes a
post, he runs atleast a few loops of getting feedback from his friends
followed by correction before publishing it.</p>

<h3 id="why-concrete-thinking-from-mail">Why concrete thinking? from mail!</h3>

<p>‚ÄúHigh-tech industries‚Äù is completely vague. Zero examples. A Dutch
person may not know what to think about when you say
‚Äúhigh-tech‚Äù. (Maybe Dutch guys all speak English, in which case
substitute some Indian villager.) You may try to explain using other
labels: ‚Äúit is an industry that deals with advanced technology and
semiconductors and software‚Äù. He still doesn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù
is.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPhone and tablets and laptops‚Äù are less vague because they are
abstract examples. You‚Äôve unpacked ‚Äúhigh-tech‚Äù into constituent
labels. But they are still labels! Again, the aforementioned,
hypothetical, ignorant Dutch person won‚Äôt know what is a ‚Äútablet‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúiPhone and iPad and Macbook‚Äù are more concrete because they are
labels for which the above Dutch person can point to examples. Yes,
it‚Äôs still not fully concrete because is it iPhone 5 or 6 or 17? Not
mentioned. Is it a golden iPhone 6 or a white iPhone 6? In fact, is it
the one that my friend has with serial number 76235 or the one your
friend has with serial number 262093? Not mentioned. But that‚Äôs
fine. We don‚Äôt need that level of detail. The difference in the
details we imagine between ‚Äúhigh-tech industry‚Äù and ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù is much
more than the difference in the details we imagine between ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù
and ‚ÄúiPhone 6‚Äù, at least for our current discussion. We would need
more details (i.e., iPhone 6S with upgrade 7.62 and 3 GB RAM or
whatever) if this were a product review article. (Imagine a product
review of the latest iPhone by a guy like me who‚Äôs like ‚ÄúiPhone 7 or 8
or whatever - ah, it‚Äôs all the same thing‚Äù - that‚Äôs not what the
consumers want. They want to know which phone will give them greater
battery life when playing PUBG, which require concrete examples.)</p>

<p><strong>Why does it matter if someone has a concrete example in their mind?</strong>
Because, then, they can test your statements on <strong>at least one
example</strong>. That is better than them just reading the labels and
nodding their head without checking it on any examples and thus not
finding if their current models were wrong. (It will also help them
remember it. Won‚Äôt go into details here; coming soon.)</p>

<p>Suppose you say that ‚Äúhigh-tech industries are becoming more and more
powerful in today‚Äôs economy and have very high profits‚Äù. With
‚Äúhigh-tech industries‚Äù, the Dutch guy may not know whether or not
that‚Äôs true. He can‚Äôt test it. When you say ‚Äúphone and laptops‚Äù, the
Dutch guy may have a better idea of whether they are becoming more and
more powerful because he sees phones and laptops around, but he still
can‚Äôt test it precisely. When you say ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù, he can test
immediately that Apple is one of the biggest companies in the world
and that it has high rates of profit. Yes, it‚Äôs not a highly empirical
test, which would point to journal papers with exact percentage growth
rates over time and comparisons to other industries, but it‚Äôs better
than just accepting the words as such. In short, one test done right
away is better than zero tests.</p>

<p>Why do we care about this dumbass, hypothetical Dutch guy who doesn‚Äôt
understand English labels? Because when you‚Äôre writing, <strong>you</strong> are
that dumbass, hypothetical Dutch guy. That means when you‚Äôre writing
with just abstract labels or reading a book with abstract labels, you
probably won‚Äôt think of a concrete example and you won‚Äôt be able to
test the statements made. What then are your chances of writing
correct statements or learning correct models?</p>

<p>So, when you use a label or see a label, make sure you have at least
one example on which you can test statements about that label. How
much detail should that example have? Enough to judge the statements.</p>

<p>Test: ‚ÄúPeople in Venezuela are desperate for food.‚Äù - vague or not?
Your answer: ___. Why?</p>

Can you **test** the claim that "they are desperate for food"? How?
You probably don't know anybody from Venezuela.

Now imagine being told: "People in Venezuela go through trash to eat
rotting food." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2pjEYBhJSo) - can you
now test the claim that they "are desperate for food"? You bet. If
someone else says that "things in Venezuela are fine; it's just a
little trouble here and there", you can say "hell no" because you have
an example on which to test that statement. Nobody in their right mind
would call eating trash "a little trouble".

**That** is the power of one concrete example.
