<p>Yesterday I was trying to understand what <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer</a> was trying say in his article, <a href="/Feeling-Rational.html">â€œFeeling Rationalâ€</a>. I didnâ€™t get far with it, so I am continuing decoding the article.</p>

<h4 id="feeling-rational">Feeling Rational</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>So is rationality orthogonal to feeling?  No; our emotions arise from our models of reality. If I believe that my dead brother has been discovered alive, I will be happy; if I wake up and realize it was a dream, I will be sad.  P. C. Hodgell said:  â€œThat which can be destroyed by the truth should be.â€  My dreaming selfâ€™s happiness was opposed by truth.  My sadness on waking is rational; there is no truth which destroys it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck does he mean by models of reality?</p>

<p>I think plants grow as a result of photosynthesis. I think, if I jump off a cliff, I will fucking fall down due to gravity. These are all beliefs. My brother is alive is a belief. So it appears to me that possibly â€˜models of realityâ€™ means belief.</p>

<p>It appears that emotions arise from our beliefs. When we are confronted by the truth against our belief, we should update our Map. This is nothing but <a href="/Feeling-Rational.html">rationality</a>. When my dreaming selfâ€™s happiness is opposed by the truth, I update my map. I feel sad as a result of my map updating to the truth. My emotion is as a result of my belief being shattered.</p>

<p>My sadness on waking seems to be a result of rationality. But what does it mean to say, â€œMy sadness on waking is rational, there is no truth which destroys it.</p>

<h4 id="counter-example">Counter example</h4>
<p>It is my belief that women will make my life 10x better. When I donâ€™t get women I am sad, When I get them I am happy. Emotions arise from my belief that women will make my life 10x better. What is rational about this emotion? I didnâ€™t update any belief.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t donâ€™t see or understand what it means to say that emotions are rational.</p>

<p>P.S
This is more than mind boggling. Fuck its a simple few sentences, but yet, I cannot understand it. It feels like I am puzzling out the intended meanings of words. So fucking hard. This sucks, that it comes from Eliezer.</p>
