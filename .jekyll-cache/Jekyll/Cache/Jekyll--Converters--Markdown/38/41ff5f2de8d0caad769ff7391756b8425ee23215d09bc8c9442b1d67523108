<p>On Apr3 I write about why I am performing a 600-word-experiment i.e, writing 600 words and making a post out of it, and publishing it. I have not been writing regularly in the past and would like to speeden the result of writing. I would like to solve problems that I currently have, discover essential stuff that I need to be doing. I have been procrastinating a lot during the weeks before and if it is really important that I figure out my life asap, then I need to expedite the whole writing and thinking process.</p>
