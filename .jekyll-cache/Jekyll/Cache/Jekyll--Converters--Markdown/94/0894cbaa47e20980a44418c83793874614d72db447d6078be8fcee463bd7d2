<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The book <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Talent is Overrated</code> explains that Talent is not something
that you are born with but something that is harnessed over years and
years of Deliberate Practice (DP). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMcdhCR9Ubw">This link</a> shows a person
learning guitar and counting the number of hours he worked on it as he
progresses. This is how it is expected to look. The more hours of DP
the more skilled you get.</p>

<p>DP in general is expected to look like,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
examining. It is activity designed specifically to improve
performance, often with a teacher‚Äôs help; it can be repeated a lot;
feedback on results is continuously available; it‚Äôs highly demanding
mentally, whether the activity is purely intellectual, such as chess
or business-related activities, or heavily physical, such as sports;
and it isn‚Äôt much fun.</p>

  <p>‚Äî Chapter 7, Talent Is Overrated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the above, in the last <a href="/Deliberate-Practice-case-study.html">essay on DP</a>, it was attempted to
DP based on the Benjamin Franklin (BF) method across 10 output
dimensions (very similar to the <a href="http://pradeep90.github.io/ben-franklin-practice.html">attempt by an STM</a>). The skill
that was aimed to be improved was ‚Äòcritical thinking‚Äô. In that context
different output dimensions such as ‚Äònumber of ideas serially
delivered‚Äô, ‚Äòconcrete examples for each idea‚Äô, ‚Äòcontinuity of
sentences and 5 others, were used. Usually, in DP a particular aspect
is practiced, with large repetition, where feedback on the results is
available immediately. For example, in one of the practices of Tiger
Woods, he stuffed balls in sand and practiced only hitting them one
after the other several times, measuring key dimensions like
distance of the ball traveled. What Tiger Woods doesn‚Äôt seem to have
done is practice one ball in the sand, focus on his grip on the next,
one ball on the grass, focus on his posture in the next, and randomly
switch between each of them. Similarly, in an attempt to keep the focus on
the one skill or one isolated part of the skill that we want to
improve currently, we aim to look at one output dimension alone (as
suggested in the Mission). We look at the dimension which looks at the
concrete examples given. More on the actual dimension later.</p>

<p>In this essay we apply the same BF method across this one
dimension. For the BF method a base article is used, notes are made, a
few days later a new version written based on the notes. Finally the
original is compared with the new version across certain output
dimensions. The article chosen is <a href="http://pradeep90.github.io/The-Solution-in-your-Head.html">The Solution In Your Head</a>

<h2 id="my-version">My Version</h2>

<p>What is the purpose of life? What do we want in life? What should we
be doing? Should we go behind girls and making lot of money, or should
we excel at work and give everything that we have to the people in
need. The answer to these questions is an important one and has the
potential to completely change the way we live our lives. We call this
answer the Solution. Right now we don‚Äôt seem to know the Solution, so
we decide to look around. Who has the answers? Where do we find this
Solution?</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say that someone hands us a gift-wrapped box with the ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù
inside. All we need to do is open it and perform it. What do we do?</p>

<h3 id="personality-of-the-solution">Personality of the solution</h3>

<p>There could be doubts about the credibility of the Solution being
delivered. Let‚Äôs assume it is the most trustworthy Solution ever. It
is hand-delivered by Albert Einstein or someone you respect the most,
after several 100 years of research, it cannot get any more credible
than this. Furthermore, the solution should be usable. If you open the
box and the box says ‚Äú42‚Äù, what are you going to be able to do with
that?  On the other hand if you open the box and it says, ‚ÄúJust follow
your feelings, to best fulfill the purpose of life‚Äù, then it is
atleast usable.</p>

<p>So let‚Äôs say we get such a credible, and usable Solution. Let‚Äôs say
the Solution is something like, ‚ÄúKill all babies in the world with a
knife‚Äù, or something much less hair-raising or diabolical like, ‚Äúslap
your Parents every time you see them‚Äù, or maybe even something
seemingly pointless as ‚Äúgo up and down the stairs until the end of
time‚Äù, What happens when you get this solution? What do you do? Every
solution, although usable and perform-able, we know we will never be
able to do it. We could imagine ways in which each of the solutions
proposed above might make sense, but we will never do it. For
instance, killing all the babies in the world could create fear in
people not to have any more children and thus prevent all of the human
race from causing more damage to the world. Far-fetched, but yeah we
can think of some scenario where it might make sense, but we are never
going to perform any of the solutions. The solution can‚Äôt just be
anything.</p>

<p>In addition to the solution being credible and usable, there seems to
be additional constraints. The solution shall not contain any killing,
beating, slavery, suicides, loneliness etc‚Ä¶ I seem to be able come up
with these constraints by myself. If Richard Feynman delivered a box
containing solutions violating the above constraints then I will not
be able to perform it. On the other hand if Richard Feynman delivered
a box saying, I should go behind girls, increase my status, gain more
power, make a lot of friends, I would pretty much say, ‚ÄúYour wish is
my command, Professor‚Äù.</p>

<h3 id="will-the-real-slim-shady-please-stand-up">Will the real slim shady please stand up</h3>

<p>I seem to be judging every solution somehow with some pre-existing
knowledge from somewhere. The constraints seem to be coming from
within. No matter what solution you see, you are going to judge it and
will be able to perform it based on if it agrees with the SOLUTION
INSIDE YOUR HEAD (SIYH). The SIYH seems to be this set of rules that
you already posses to guide you in what is right and wrong.</p>

<p>Ah so you have the solution inside your head! Game over? Does this
mean you know what to do in your life? Well, in the beginning we
didn‚Äôt know what the fuck to do with our lives. We were unable to
choose between ‚Äúgoing behind girls‚Äù and ‚Äúdedicating life to save as
many people as you can‚Äù. We are still at ‚ÄúWhat the hell are we
supposed to do in life?‚Äù Nice that the solution is within, but the
story seems to be far from over.</p>

<h3 id="siyh-is-fixed">SIYH is fixed?</h3>

<p>Although the SIYH is within the head we still don‚Äôt know what to
do. Just looking inside seems to be not enough. So we continue to look
outside for gift-wrapped boxes to get more clues. Granted that we are
only able to look at these boxes through the SIYH, but we have no
other option. If the SIYH is fixed‚Äîcannot be modified‚Äîthen there
is no point of looking outside. If no matter what happens we will
still have the same understanding of the SIYH, then the gift box is
worthless. But there used to be a time when I thought being Gay was
blasphemous. There used to be a time when I thought Vaishnavism
(religion) was the way to live life, there used to be a time when I
thought life was about getting girls and rising in status. And now I
seem to have some completely different views. What happened?</p>

<p>The SIYH seems to have been modified! Someone (an STM) came to me with
a gift-wrapped box, which said, ‚ÄúGays are also people just like
us. What they do in the bedroom is none of your business. If they are
attracted to men, so be it. Who said men should be attracted to women
only. You seem to be echoing the popular opinion amongst the society
you grew up in. Just because 1 billion people think something is true,
does not make it true‚Äù. Almost magically, my SIYH started changing it
self. The SIYH was used to modify itself. It seems like the SIYH can
be modified as long as it is within the current rules of the SIYH. The
SIYH used its rule of logic to modify itself.</p>

<h3 id="map-vs-territory">Map vs territory</h3>

<p>The SIYH can be thought of as being modified or it can be thought that
the true SIYH is being uncovered more and more. Just like in ancient
days where people made rough maps of the actual terrain, and updated
it with more information as they explored it; we seem to be doing the
same thing. We initially have a rough map (SIYH), with some mountains
and rivers drawn not to scale (sex is good, killing is bad, Gays are
not welcome in the society etc‚Ä¶). We use that map to get some water
from the river (Hating on Gays according to the SIYH) and find some
inconsistencies in the Map (when someone delivered the gift-wrapped
box). Naturally you updated your Map, so that you can find the water
correctly next time, so that it is closer to the actual territory (the
TRUE SIYH).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="output-dimensions">Output dimensions</h2>

<p>So now that we have the main essay and our version of it, we need
output dimensions to compare. The following are the dimensions chosen.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #1</strong> : Main ideas that are part of the essay, must be
identified. No grade is given for this rule. It just facilitates other
rules.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #2</strong> : The main ideas shall each have one example atleast.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #3</strong> : In my version of the essay, all places worthy of examples
shall have examples.</p>

<p>This is a quite vague, I accept, but if you have a look at the mission
and its examples, it is much less vague.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, instead of ‚ÄúYou run scenarios in your mind where you
are verbally battling with them‚Äù, you would give an example of a
‚Äúverbal battle‚Äù. Or, when we see ‚ÄúThe book ‚ÄòTalent is Overrated‚Äô
seems to suggest that greatness is not only for a select few.‚Äù, we
should also know what ‚Äúgreatness‚Äù looks like and who those ‚Äúselect
few‚Äù were who we wrongly assumed to be sole possessors of
talent. And when you say ‚ÄúIn fact there exists a path that runs
between your current abilities to that of the greats.‚Äù, I would like
a concrete example for this bold claim (maybe a video like
this). And, finally, ‚ÄúThe journey will be hard, long and
demanding.‚Äù - like how hard, how long, and how demanding?</p>

  <p>‚Äî from the Mission</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Rule #4</strong> : Rule #3 but for STM‚Äôs essay instead.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #5</strong> : Should not have missed any critical points as compared to an
STM‚Äôs essay.</p>

<h2 id="comparing">Comparing</h2>

<p><strong>Part I</strong></p>

<p>STM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Entry question: What is the purpose of life?</p>

  <p>Setting it up In ‚ÄúThe Big Problems‚Äù, I started talking about the
biggest obstacles on our path to getting what we want. What I left
out there was the most important issue - what do we really want?</p>

  <p>What is it that we‚Äôre searching for? What is the ‚Äúpurpose of our
Life‚Äù? Is there any ‚Äúmeaning to Life‚Äù?</p>

  <p>We‚Äôll answer all these questions and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ME:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the purpose of life? What do we want in life? What should we
be doing? Should we go behind girls and making lot of money, or
should we excel at work and give everything that we have to the
people in need. The answer to these questions is an important one
and has the potential to completely change the way we live our
lives. We call this answer the Solution. Right now we don‚Äôt seem to
know the Solution, so we decide to look around. Who has the answers?
Where do we find this Solution?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule #1: The main idea discussed here by me as well as an STM, is the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lack of knowledge about what we need to do in life</code>.</p>

<p>Rule #2: I have given an example to emphasize the main idea discussed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should we go behind girls and making lot of money, or
should we excel at work and give everything that we have to the
people in need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt look like an STM has done that.</p>

<p>0-1 for Agent!</p>

<p>Rule #3: It appears that I should have given some examples to support the
following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer to these questions is an important one and has the
potential to completely change the way we live our lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it should be expanded to the following, containing examples.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe answer to these questions is important owing to the limited time
we have on this planet. If the answer to this question is about
getting better at say critical thinking, then the sooner we start the
better. This solution thus has the potential to change our lives
drastically. As focusing on girls, would mean to work on skills like
‚Äòpicking up‚Äô, magic and the like, where as wanting to be altruistic
needs you to be extremely good at things that make money or saves
large number of people.‚Äù</p>

<p>2-0 for STM</p>

<p>Rule #4: I don‚Äôt think an STM needed to give any more examples except
for the ones mentioned in Rule #2.</p>

<p>0-0</p>

<p>Rule #5: Looks like we both covered the same thing.</p>

<p>0-0</p>

<p>In total : 2-1 for STM</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Part II</strong></p>

<p>STM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The necessary first step
Let‚Äôs look at the problem in more detail
(long long time since I‚Äôve been saying this).</p>

  <p>What would the Solution look like? If I said there was someone
behind the door who had the Solution, what would you guess about the
nature of the Solution, without knowing anything in particular about
that person?</p>

  <p>Ground rule: We talk only in terms of‚Ä¶ words? dictionary
definitions? references to philosophers? Nah! Only Impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ok, assume I have a gift-wrapped Box with me. In it lies the answer
to all the questions you‚Äôve been asking about goals and purposes and
meaning and stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ME:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let‚Äôs say that someone hands us a gift-wrapped box with the
‚ÄúSolution‚Äù inside. All we need to do is open it and perform it. What
do we do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule #1: The main idea discussed here by me is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">introduction of the
gift-wrapped box</code>. An STM is also discussing the same.</p>

<p>Rule #2: I think a few examples of how the gift-wrapped box or the
Solution inside should look seems to be missing. Although they are
delivered in the next parts of the essay.</p>

<p>0-0 for both</p>

<p>In total: 1-1</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Part III</strong></p>

<p>STM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The essence of all your questions basically is - How should I live
my life?</p>

  <p>We want something that will tell us what we should do at each point
in life.</p>

  <p>Well, the Solution inside will tell you exactly how you should best
live your life.</p>

  <p>I hand over the Box to you. You are free to open it after a minute.</p>

  <p>What happens now? What will the Impact be? Why do you want the
answer? Why not just throw the Box away?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Planning Ahead What will happen when we have the Solution?</p>

  <p>We may not know what the Solution will be, but we‚Äôre expecting
something we can use, right? We don‚Äôt expect the ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù to be
‚Äú42‚Äù. That doesn‚Äôt tell us anything. It is of no use to us.</p>

  <p>Remember what I‚Äôd written a long time ago, in the overconfident
exuberance of my youth, about solving Hard problems?</p>

  <p>When you have banged your head about for what seems like forever and
have bruised your head to the size of a pumpkin, you may NOW go to a
person in the know and ask two or three pointed specific questions.</p>

  <p>These questions should be like door-keys.</p>

  <p>You should be confident that once you have the answers to these
questions (aka the keys), you can basically go straight ahead and
open the door to the safe.</p>

  <p>You should have figured out just about everything else.</p>

  <p>Once you get these answers and turn the key in the keyhole,
everything else should click into place and the safe should open.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs like you have a safe which you know is opened by some
combination. A genie appears in front of you. When you ask the genie
what the combination to the safe is, you know the answer is gonna be
somewhere between 0000 to 9999 (or whatever). Or, worst case, the
safe could be tricked up such that no combination opens
it. Cool. But these are the ONLY possibilities. The genie‚Äôs answer
can only be one of these.</p>

  <p>Which means, you can decide on actions for each eventuality, well in
advance. If the genie says 1376 is the key, you will punch
in 1376. If the genie says 8365, you will punch in 8365. If the
genie says there is no combination, you will call in some heavy
machinery and drill the shit out of that safe.</p>

  <p>Your plans of action have already been decided. All you need to know
is which plan you need to take forward.</p>

  <p>And remember, there has to be an answer to the questions you‚Äôve
asked. There has to be a best way (or several best ways) to live
your life. Not all life outcomes are equally valuable, right?</p>

  <p>So, assume that the gift-wrapped Box contains The Solution, the
right one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ME:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There could be doubts about the credibility of the Solution being
delivered. Let‚Äôs assume it is the most trustworthy Solution ever. It
is hand-delivered by Albert Einstein or someone you respect the
most, after several 100 years of research, it cannot get any more
credible than this. Furthermore, the solution should be usable. If
you open the box and the box says ‚Äú42‚Äù, what are you going to be
able to do with that?  On the other hand if you open the box and it
says, ‚ÄúJust follow your feelings, to best fulfill the purpose of
life‚Äù, then it is atleast usable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule #1: Here I primarily write about 2 things, one is about the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">credibility of the solution</code> and the other is about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usability of
the solution</code>.</p>

<p>An STM seems to write about, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what the solution should contain</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usability of the solution</code> and ends with the assumption about the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gift-wrapped box being the right one</code>.</p>

<p>Rule #2: I have given examples of what it means to be credible i.e.,
that the solution is coming from science or coming from one of the
greatest researchers of all time. I also give examples for what it
means that a solution is usable. I give examples for usable and
non-usable cases.</p>

<p>An STM, gives examples for what a usable solution should not look
like, but fails to provide an example of how a usable solution should
look like. Strike I think! An STM doesn‚Äôt really talk about the
credibility of the solution the way I did, so I don‚Äôt think he is
obliged to add any more examples.</p>

<p>1-2 for Agent.</p>

<p>Rule #3: There seem not to be other places that I need to give
examples for.</p>

<p>Rule #4: An STM talks about what the solution should inform, such as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want something that will tell us what we should do at each point
in life</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, the Solution inside will tell you exactly how you should best
live your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he is missing atleast 2 examples.</p>

<p>0-2 for Agent!</p>

<p>Total: 1-4 for Agent!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Part IV</strong></p>

<p>STM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contemplating the Ifs</p>

  <p>What will you do if the ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù says that
life has no meaning?</p>

  <p>What will you do if the ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù says that the purpose of life is
to go to the ‚ÄúWhy this Kolaveri Di‚Äù Youtube page and watch it again
and again?</p>

  <p>Let‚Äôs kick it up a notch. What if the ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù says that the
purpose of life is to go and shoot everybody else on the planet?</p>

  <p>What if the ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù says that the purpose of life is to kill your
parents, siblings if any, relatives, best friends, and any babies
you find along the way?</p>

  <p>What if the ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù says the purpose of life is to cut off your
legs and toss them into the ocean?</p>

  <p>What if the ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù says the purpose of life is to kill yourself
as soon as possible?</p>

  <p>Legitimately Wrong</p>

  <p>First off, recognize that every single one of the
above ‚ÄúSolutions‚Äù is a perfectly legitimate answer to your question.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of life? Kill your loved ones.‚Äù You can imagine
a world where this answer could be right. It probably won‚Äôt be
anything like our world, but it is possible.</p>

  <p>And yet, every one of them is laughably wrong. There is just no way
any of them is the real answer!</p>

  <p>But how could you know that?!</p>

  <p>You don‚Äôt know the real answer to the question. You could be
mistaken, right? People in the past were mistaken about what
revolved around what, and whether the Earth was flat, and stuff. Why
couldn‚Äôt we be wrong about what the ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù of our life is?</p>

  <p>What‚Äôs happening here?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Method to the Madness This means that there is more to it than
meets the eye. We have some more constraints to place on the set of
possible solutions. The Box can‚Äôt contain any arbitrary goal and
proclaim it to be the ‚Äúpurpose of our life‚Äù. This means we have some
information about the Solution already.</p>

  <p>The Box contains the ‚Äúpurpose of your life‚Äù and how you should go
about living your life. There is a correct answer and a genie has
come up with the answer in the box.</p>

  <p>What now?</p>

  <p>Since it contains the perfect way for you to live your life,
shouldn‚Äôt you just go ahead and do whatever it says? Remember, the
box contains the Ultimate Purpose of your life. It has the answer to
the question ‚ÄúHow should I live my life‚Äù? That is the Impact that we
seek from the Box. We are in a game without knowing any of its
rules. We don‚Äôt know how to play. We‚Äôre just struggling around doing
crap. We want to know.</p>

  <p>Because the Box contains perfect information, it means that whatever
it says is basically The Way to live our life.</p>

  <p>Which means, we need to do exactly what the Solution turns out to
be. And, it could be anything! We could currently have incorrect
views about the world (just like the earth is flat, sun revolves
around it, etc.).</p>

  <p>But if the Solution says that we should go and kill people, we won‚Äôt
do that! If it says that we should kill ourselves, we won‚Äôt do that!</p>

<p>ME:</p>

<p>Rule #1: The main idea of this part is to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show that the Solution

same thing.</p>

of unacceptable solutions which reflects the main idea.</p>

mistaken, right? People in the past were mistaken about what
revolved around what‚Ä¶</p>

<p>STM talks about how we could be wrong and yet we don‚Äôt accept THE

<p><strong>Part V</strong></p>

<p>STM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
Hey!</p>

  <p>As mentioned at the beginning, the Solution is basically something
that will tell us what we should do at each point. It will give us
the answer to the question: ‚ÄúHow should I live my life?‚Äù.</p>

  <p>But here, we overrode the advice the Solution gave! That means that
the Solution is not the final adjudicator. We make the final
decision. We are using a different Solution in our Head to decide
what we should do. That Solution in our Head is what we‚Äôre really
using to decide how to live our life.</p>

  <p>This means that, for all practical purposes, there is no point in
saying that Solution X is the real way we should live our lives. Why
not? Because it is not gonna have any Impact. If it contradicts with
the Solution in our Head, we will not do anything Solution X
says. The Solution in our Head is the one we are going to use at the
end of the day.</p>

  <p>Dude! I know you‚Äôre struggling here, but you seem to be making a
basic error. The Solution in your Head is what you will use to
decide how you live. But the Solution in the Box is what you should
use to decide how to live.</p>

  <p>That isn‚Äôt the real point. The point is, does it matter?!</p>

  <p>How does it affect anything in any way what the Solution in the Box
is? You will not do what it says. At the end of the day, the only
Solution that you will use is the Solution in your Head.</p>

  <p>In fact, suppose I came to you and said that the real, true,
ultimate purpose of your life is to go kill your family members. Not
for any good reason, like ‚Äúyou will get insurance money‚Äù. Just do it
because it is the ‚Äúreal purpose‚Äù of your life. You will laugh in my
face. There is no way it is happening. Why? Cos it clashes with the
Solution in your Head.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, if I said that part of the ‚Äúpurpose of your life‚Äù
is to have fun with your friends and hang out with members of the
opposite sex and stuff, you will agree in a jiffy. What happened?
Yup. It agreed with the Solution in your Head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ME:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I seem to be judging every solution somehow with some pre-existing
knowledge from somewhere. The constraints seem to be coming from
within. No matter what solution you see, you are going to judge it
and will be able to perform it based on if it agrees with the
SOLUTION INSIDE YOUR HEAD (SIYH). The SIYH seems to be this set of
rules that you already posses to guide you in what is right and
wrong.</p>

  <p>Ah so you have the solution inside your head! Game over? Does this
mean you know what to do in your life? Well, in the beginning we
didn‚Äôt know what the fuck to do with our lives. We were unable to
choose between ‚Äúgoing behind girls‚Äù and ‚Äúdedicating life to save as
many people as you can‚Äù. We are still at ‚ÄúWhat the hell are we
supposed to do in life?‚Äù Nice that the solution is within, but the
story seems to be far from over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule #1: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIYH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What does it mean for the initial questions
asked</code> are the main points discussed here. An STM talks mainly about
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIYH</code>.</p>

<p>Rule #2: I have not delivered even one example, for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the SIYH</code> whereas
an STM has delivered examples. It seems like I just delivered examples
in the previous paragraph about this. But when I am reading it, it
still feels like I need a solid example here. Either I should re-write
to accommodate the examples here or I should re-write the paragraphs
to feel like it is not repetitive. But I didn‚Äôt so, Strike!</p>

<p>1-0 for an STM</p>

<p>Rule #5: I like how an STM contrasts the <em>‚ÄòShould do‚Äô</em> solution with
the <em>‚ÄòWill do‚Äô</em> solution. You <em>SHOULD</em> perform the Solution in the Box
and you <em>WILL</em> perform it only if it is in accordance with the SIYH. I
missed this part here.</p>

<p>1-0 for an STM</p>

<p>Total: 2-0 for an STM!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Part VI</strong></p>

<p>STM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Inescapable Reality</strong></p>

  <p>Think about what this means. The Solution is not out there
somewhere. It is in your head. In fact, it cannot be outside your
head. No matter what is shown in front of you as your purpose, you
will always judge it using‚Ä¶ the Solution in your Head.</p>

  <p>In f*cking fact, you cannot do anything different!!</p>

  <p>There is no way on Earth you can judge something without using the
Solution in your Head!</p>

  <p>Your view is FOREVER coloured!</p>

  <p>Kissing girls - awesome (for boys)!</p>

  <p>Kissing the backend of a syphilitic donkey - yuck!</p>

  <p>Murdering loved ones randomly - yuck! No!</p>

  <p>Hanging out with friends - yay!</p>

  <p>Giving some of our hard-earned money to a friend in need - Right.</p>

  <p>Having sex with someone against their will - Wrong.</p>

  <p>All else being equal, no matter how eloquently some Solution X tries
to convince you that you must go and rape innocent people, you will
not do it. You will just show it the middle finger.</p>

  <p>There we go! We do have information about the Solution. It‚Äôs right
here in our head. There is already a GPS in our head guiding our
path through life.</p>

  <p><strong>Mapping the Territory</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is that all there is to it?</p>

  <p>Remember, if we already have the Solution in our Head, then there is
no use in opening the Box. We can just throw it away. It is not
gonna give us any new information. It won‚Äôt change anything. We will
still do exactly the same thing we were gonna do anyway.</p>

  <p>Hmmm‚Ä¶ So Humans should basically want and do the same things no
matter when or where they are‚Ä¶ right?</p>

  <p>But are there any discrepancies? Yeah! In the non-normality essay,
we saw how our notion of what is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù had kept evolving over the
ages. No to Slavery, No to Disenfranchisement of Women, Sorta-Ok to
Living it Large while Lots of Other People Suffer‚Ä¶ yup. Normality
has been evolving. And that is nothing but our good old friend,
Mr. Solution in our Head.</p>

  <p>Killing another man in a duel over some trifling matter wasn‚Äôt too
much of a big deal earlier. It was honorable, even. Now it is
considered a very bad thing to do, other things being equal.</p>

  <p>The Solution has evolved! Or, rather, our understanding of the
Solution in our Head has evolved.</p>

  <p>It is like a rough map of some terrain. Initially, it just marks out
some hills and a river (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kill me, I won‚Äôt kill you. Let‚Äôs hunt
together‚Äù). Nothing is to scale. There are vast parts unmarked (‚Äúhow
to treat women, blacks, gays, etc.‚Äù). Then, as we gain more and more
knowledge, we fill in the vaguer parts of the map (‚ÄúAh! Black people
are basically just like me. It is wrong to treat them like slaves‚Äù).</p>

  <p>Make no mistake, we have just explored a tiny bit of the
territory. There are huge sections of the map still hazy and blank.</p>

  <p>Not only can we discover things we didn‚Äôt know, we can overturn
beliefs that were wrong. People in the past firmly believed that it
was ok to beat children like hell. Now, people are changing their
minds.</p>

  <p>In essence, it is like there is this actual territory out there
which we are slowly capturing in our maps. Step by step, we are
evolving our maps towards the actual territory. We are upgrading our
understanding of the Solution in our Head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ME:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the SIYH is within the head we still don‚Äôt know what to
do. Just looking inside seems to be not enough. So we continue to
look outside for gift-wrapped boxes to get more clues. Granted that
we are only able to look at these boxes through the SIYH, but we
have no other option. If the SIYH is fixed‚Äîcannot be
modified‚Äîthen there is no point of looking outside. If no matter
what happens we will still have the same understanding of the SIYH,
then the gift box is worthless. But there used to be a time when I
thought being Gay was blasphemous. There used to be a time when I
thought Vaishnavism (religion) was the way to live life, there used
to be a time when I thought life was about getting girls and rising
in status. And now I seem to have some completely different
views. What happened?</p>

  <p>The SIYH seems to have been modified! Someone (an STM) came to me
with a gift-wrapped box, which said, ‚ÄúGays are also people just like
us. What they do in the bedroom is none of your business. If they
are attracted to men, so be it. Who said men should be attracted to
women only. You seem to be echoing the popular opinion amongst the
society you grew up in. Just because 1 billion people think
something is true, does not make it true‚Äù. Almost magically, my SIYH
started changing it self. The SIYH was used to modify itself. It
seems like the SIYH can be modified as long as it is within the
current rules of the SIYH. The SIYH used its rule of logic to modify
itself.</p>

  <p>The SIYH can be thought of as being modified or it can be thought
that the true SIYH is being uncovered more and more. Just like in
ancient days where people made rough maps of the actual terrain, and
updated it with more information as they explored it; we seem to be
doing the same thing. We initially have a rough map (SIYH), with
some mountains and rivers drawn not to scale (sex is good, killing
is bad, Gays are not welcome in the society etc‚Ä¶). We use that map
to get some water from the river (Hating on Gays according to the
SIYH) and find some inconsistencies in the Map (when someone
delivered the gift-wrapped box). Naturally you updated your Map, so
that you can find the water correctly next time, so that it is
closer to the actual territory (the TRUE SIYH).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule #1: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIYH can be modified</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Map vs territory connection</code> are the
2 main ideas I am focusing on in the above paragraphs. An STM focuses
on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">how our view is colored forever</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIYH can be modified</code> and the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Map vs Territory connection</code>.</p>

<p>Rule #2: I seem to have provided examples for the main points in ‚ÄòRule
#1‚Äô using ‚Äòhow our view about Gays has changed over time‚Äô as the main
example. An STM has given proper examples for all the main points as
well.</p>

<p>1-1</p>

<p>Rule #3: When writing about the Map and Territory connection, I
purposely skipped providing an example in the end as I couldn‚Äôt come
up with it at that time. Strike for me!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶ find some inconsistencies in the Map (when someone
delivered the gift-wrapped box). Naturally you updated your Map, so
that you can find the water correctly next time, so that it is
closer to the actual territory (the TRUE SIYH)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said, ‚Äúthe TRUE SIYH‚Äù, instead it should have been, ‚ÄúGays are also
people like us and very much welcome everywhere, just as Straight
people are‚Äù</p>

<p>1-0 for STM</p>

<p>Rule #5: A closing statement on what it means for us is missing in my
version. Also I think what is missing in my text is, we are yet to
discover a ton more of the map and over throw many of our beliefs. An
STM very well featured it as shown below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are vast parts unmarked (‚Äúhow to treat women, blacks, gays,
etc.‚Äù). Then, as we gain more and more knowledge, we fill in the
vaguer parts of the map (‚ÄúAh! Black people are basically just like
me. It is wrong to treat them like slaves‚Äù).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1-0 for STM</p>

<p>Total: 3-1 for STM</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<h3 id="scores">Scores</h3>

<p>The scores seem to indicate that an STM on average has done better
than me. Lot of space to improve.</p>

<p>Rule #1 was not scored as it was expected to only assist Rule #2.</p>

<p>Rule #2 was expected to be the rule that allowed to see if I have
examples for the main points determined in Rule #1. It appears that in
a few places (2 out of 6 parts) I have defaulted on this rule; and an
STM has defaulted as well (3 out of 6 times). According to me, it
appears that the places where I missed is not really a big deal, as I
had delivered the examples in the passages just before and after. In
one case (‚ÄòPart II‚Äô) I had not given examples of the gift-wrapped box,
but they show up in the subsequent paragraphs. In the other case where
I missed (‚ÄòPart V‚Äô), I just gave an example in the last paragraph, and
didn‚Äôt want the paragraph to sound repetitive. I don‚Äôt want to come
across as being cocky, I just want to clarify how I feel. The reader
shall correct me appropriately.</p>

<p>Rule #3 was about the places other than the main points where I <em>feel</em>
like I missed giving an explanation, based on the examples in the
mission:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe book ‚ÄòTalent is Overrated‚Äô seems to suggest that greatness is
not only for a select few.‚Äù, we should also know what ‚Äúgreatness‚Äù
looks like and who those ‚Äúselect few‚Äù were who we wrongly assumed to
be sole possessors of talent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I missed 2 out of 6 parts. Whereas an STM missed 1 out of 6 parts
(Rule #4). I admit I don‚Äôt know if in some places examples are
required even. It just <em>feels</em> right, so I try to penalize myself so
that I can get feedback from a reader later. As an illustration, in
Part 1 Rule #3, it felt like I had to clarify what the hell I was
saying, with an example here,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer to these questions is an important one and has the
potential to completely change the way we live our lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚ÄúImportant‚Äù why? ‚Äúpotential to completely change the way we live‚Äù why?</p>

<p>Rule #5 was just there to help me realize when I miss some <em>valid</em>
points from making. When I realize it I make a note. I didn‚Äôt try to
go out of my way to find faults. I seem to have defaulted 2 out of 6
Parts even then.</p>

<p>Overall, there is a lot of scope for improvement. If I want to improve
this, I need to do more such exercises and compare over time how I
fare. Nowadays, I find my inner voice aiding me to write examples, by
sometimes spotting the need for examples automatically, and even if I
am lazy, pushing me to write them. I guess this is how DP provides
results. For example today when I was writing the introduction, there
was a point when I was discussing ‚Äòworking with one dimension at a
time‚Äô. I managed to deliver an example involving ‚ÄòTiger Woods playing
only the sand-balls as DP‚Äô. Also looking at old articles would help to
see the growth before DP and afer DP.</p>

<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<!-- impact -->

<p>The bigger point that an STM is trying to push me towards is I think
that words mean shit. Without examples you are nothing. When someone
says ‚ÄúYou need to be great‚Äù. WTF does it even mean? What do I need to
do? Where do I go? How to I train? In what do I train? etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p>We deliver examples to allow us to see where we are failing. If you
remember Mission #2, it gets clear. We cannot work with words.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mission #2: Collect actual, everyday instances where you fell short
because of lack of ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù (why am I putting ‚Äúcritical
thinking‚Äù in scare quotes?) and divide them into skills. No abstract
skills like ‚Äúlogical structure‚Äù or ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù. Concrete
instances where you failed. That will give you harsh feedback</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am failing at work Viz., I suck at organizing information and
providing actions based out of it in a convincing way to my Boss at
work. Close enough, but an actual link to the PowerPoint I am
referring to would help I guess. As said before, my antennas are
moderately on alert now, to deliver examples and not just deliver
words. I guess with more exercises I can hopefully see more change and
naturally have the tendency to drop examples like dropping bombs in
the middle east (without thought or hesitation) as and where needed,
and reach a state of unconscious consistency over time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A word about Unconscious consistency (UC). UC is not where
we want to be in most skills, as it seems to stop growth in that skill
(Chapter 5, Talent is Overrated). Think about driving, where in the
beginning you struggle to put all the knowledge and actions together,
then you slowly start getting a grip of the whole thing and within
some time, you are talking on the phone and driving almost
automatically. And our improvement slows down dramatically from there
onward. But that is okay, we just want to be able to drive safely and
move around conveniently. For most things that is not a problem. In
the case of determining where to drop examples that is all I want I
guess.</p>

<p>In other cases though, say when you are organizing information and
providing solutions‚Äîbased on that‚Äîto your boss, you might want to be
like Tiger Woods, conscious, controlled and not automatic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frequently when we see great performers doing what they do, it
strikes us that they‚Äôve practiced for so long, and done it so many
times, they can just do it automatically. But in fact, what they
have achieved is the ability to avoid doing it automatically.</p>

  <p>By contrast, great performers never allow themselves to reach the
automatic, arrested-development stage in their chosen field.</p>

  <p>‚Äî Chapter 5, Talent is Overrated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKANS5rnrqI"> video of Tiger Woods stopping mid-shot</a> unable to focus
because of the shadow of a bird flying behind him. Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSnJIEa_WE">him
stopping mid-shot so many times over his career</a>, informing us that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶ ultimately the performance is always conscious, controlled, and
not automatic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="not-that-hard">Not that hard</h3>

<p>Overall it didn‚Äôt feel like I was on the edge, like the last time when
I did this assignment. I was literally racing to finish, there was so
much to do and I couldn‚Äôt afford any sorts of distractions. This time,
I am quite relaxed as I am finishing this assignment over the final
4-8 hrs of the assignment. Why is this not hard, why is it
boringish‚Äîwhether it is comparing the original and my version or
writing my own version of the essay?</p>

<p>Hypothesis: It is because we measured lesser dimensions at a time so lesser
words, lesser work, lesser time required for work. But then I
allocated more time in total.</p>

<p>Observation: Not hard enough, not on the edge of the seat, lot of distraction
this time, thinking about random things when I was supposed to be
clocking DP hours.</p>

<p>Observation: Didn‚Äôt have to do much of planning as I was confident of
finishing the assignment anyway. Whereas the last time I remember
giving half an hour for one part and forcing myself to meet the time
constraints.</p>

<p>Observation: Lower Words/hr written in SIYH compared to RorG! Lower
total words written in SIYH compared to RorG! Implying that the time
allocated for DP‚Äôing this time seems to be larger than required.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion and action:</strong> It is clear that the number of words per
hour is much less in the case of this essay. To make it challenging
lesser time should have been allocated to complete the task with
lesser dimensions. If I use the Words/hr of the RorG DP essay, it
appears that I would need ~16 hrs to finish this SIYH DP essay, which
I spent 23 hrs on. Maybe that is somewhere to start. Next time I
either increase the content delivered or reduce the time to match with
RorG. We‚Äôll evaluate how the task is the next time and factor in other
variables of motivation if need be.</p>

<h3 id="other-issues">Other issues</h3>

<!-- Stupid issues -->

<p>From earlier it is already clear that the hardness of the task needs
to be factored in, and consciously accounted for. But I had some other
issues while writing this essay as well.</p>

<p>I have written my version and was in the process of comparing mine
with the original. For this I needed segments of the original and my
version, to match. The issue was ‚ÄòWhere do I put this paragraph, in
part X or part X+1?‚Äô</p>

<p>I would like to spend majority of the time on doing real comparisons
and not bothering about things like which paragraphs belong in which
part. I spent quite some time, stuck at places not sure if a paragraph
is supposed to be in this part or the next. I think this came about
because I was worried about getting too much help from the notes while
writing my version, I was even considering shuffling the order of the
notes just like BF did. Luckily I didn‚Äôt, it would have been much
harder to match the paragraphs. BF shuffled his notes to allow himself
the opportunity to learn how to organize his texts well. I don‚Äôt think
that is the skill I am working on right now. I should be completely
focused on finding where I am missing examples and dropping them. That
is it!</p>

<p>I want to suggest that I make <em>notes per section of the original
essay</em> or per set of paragraphs and clearly demarcate them while
making notes. This way while making my version, I will make it based
on the demarcations in the notes. This way I suppose I don‚Äôt have any
paragraph overlapping between 2 parts. And regarding making it too
easy for me or being able to recollect from the original essay, I
think I should wait a few days before re-writing from the notes.</p>

<!-- ### Being distracted -->

<!-- I think I am involved in drama and those are having the potential to -->
<!-- suck me in them, right from eating in a group and sorting out the -->
<!-- money issues and , to the girl whose texts I long for to the drama in -->
<!-- my occupational life, to the goddamning persuation caused by y indian -->
<!-- friend and his dutch gf. Do you hear it already? In addition to -->

<!-- to deal with. The last few days atleast, when I am not expecting -->
<!-- anything from her, I am much more peaceful. I am not anxious for -->
<!-- anything. Yes that is it, anxiety! Jesus fucking christ! -->

<!-- <\!-- why are examples quite important -\-> -->

<h3 id="road-ahead">Road ahead</h3>

<p>An STM always asks me in the Mission to provide clear plans and not be
vague. That has been the foundation.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So I try. I don‚Äôt want to be like, ‚ÄúI have to do many more essays‚Äù and
leave it at that. I think it is a way for me to escape from thinking
what I actually need to be doing next.</p>

<p>I am unsure how I should take this forward. Yes, I would like to do a
few more essays just like this one with the above format and output
dimensions. But, I am not sure where this is going. I am not sure what
I am solving or where this is going to help.</p>

<p>When I practice basketball every Saturday, I am not looking for
anything more than killing it on the game with friends on next day. I
know where I suck in the game and simply focus on getting better in
those particular situations with high repetition. Over time I want to
be really good, that people turn their heads, and hope to keep playing
this sport well into old age. It is one place where I can stand long
duration‚Äôs of cardio without batting an eye. So I like how it is going
on. But in the case of ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù, I don‚Äôt know how my
current work is going to help me?</p>

<p>What is the high-level skill I am working on? Is it ‚Äúcritical
thinking‚Äù? What will this do for me? Where can I expect to see these
results? If I don‚Äôt know about this, then I think I am as clueless as
the x-girlfriend of Andrew (from Whiplash) (Writing-Rule#8
trying-too-hard;)).</p>

<p>Will the real slim shady please stand up? I think I need to either
revisit or redo, Mission #2, and make the connection.</p>
