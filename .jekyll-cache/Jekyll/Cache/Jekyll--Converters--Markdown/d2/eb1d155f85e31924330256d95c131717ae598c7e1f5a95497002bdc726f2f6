<blockquote>
  <p>Bayesian reasoning is about how to revise our beliefs in the light of evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A nurse is screening a set of students for Diseasitis. From past studies we know that 20% of students will have Diseasitis at this time of the year. A color-changing tongue depressor, is used to identify who has Diseasitis and not. Among patients who have Diseasitis, 90% turn the tongue depressor black. It also turns black 30% of the time for healthy students.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the students comes into the nurses office and takes a test and turns the tongue depressor black. what is the probability that he has Diseasitis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have read this article quite some time back and remember the solution. It seems easier to do it the following way as suggested in the same <a href="https://arbital.com/p/bayes_frequency_diagram/?l=55z">article on Arbital</a>.</p>

<h4 id="glossary">Glossary</h4>

<p>No. of students who have Diseasitis = N_D</p>

<p>No. of students who do not have Diseasitis = N_dnD</p>

<p>No. of students whose tongue depressor turns black &amp; have Diseasitis = N_D_B</p>

<p>No. of students whose tongue depressor turns black &amp; <em>do not</em> have Diseasitis = N_dnD_B</p>

<h4 id="action">Action</h4>

<p>Letâ€™s say there are 100 students.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>20% of students will have Diseasitis.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ N_D = 20 

$ N_dnD = 80 
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among patients who have Diseasitis, 90% turn the tongue depressor black.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ N_D_B = 90% of N_D = 18
</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>It also turns black 30% of the time for healthy students.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ N_dnD_B = 30% of N_dnD = 24
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the students comes into the nurses office and takes a test and turns the tongue depressor black. what is the probability that he has Diseasitis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>P (a student who has turned the depressor black has Deseasitis):
	$ (N_D_B)/(N_D_B + N_dnD_B) = 18/(24+18) = 18/42 = 3/7 = 43%</p>

<p>Why and where is Bayes theorem useful for us?</p>
