issues for you.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>go to windows â€œDisk Managementâ€ and then look at the large
partition that you wanna split and then unallocate it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make a live USB of Ubuntu so that you can manipulate Ubuntu. Follow
<a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview">these instructions</a> word-for-word and that is good enough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make Back up in your original Ubuntu on your Google Drive. Just the
important stuff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restart! and Boot live USB stick using F12 for ACER. Sometimes this
might not work, in which case you need to go to the system menu
somehow (available in the grub boot menu) and change there in
â€œMainâ€ to enable â€œF12 bootâ€.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>F12</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open live USB and go to â€œGpartedâ€.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Move as per requirements. Here is a <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/114503/how-to-resize-your-ubuntu-partitions/">nice tutorial</a> from
â€œhow-to-geekâ€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If unallocated part is not next to the part you want to expand,
this then involves moving all the partitions so that the
unallocated is next. This has the â€œWarning-dangerâ€ message even for
â€œmovingâ€ a partition. Do AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>â€œUnallocatedâ€ needs to be close to the partition you are interested
in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moving partitions is as â€œdangerous soundingâ€ as re-sizing
partitions. In my case I had to move partitions so that the
unallocated space came in the endâ€¦ But this is not worth the
FAILURE if it does happen nowâ€¦</p>

    <p>I will cross the bridge when the time comes. I am confident about
reinstalling. I mainly need emacs for now and everything related to
that is on the cloud, like my blog and the init settings. So I
should be gucci.</p>
