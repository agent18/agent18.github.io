<p>So yesterday we were at this point in the empirical evidence essay where we outlined some ways to re-align the map to its territory. One of which was to ‚Äústand on the shoulders of giants‚Äù. When possible yes we can. But when you want to know the impact of doing something like say, ‚Äúwriting 600 words a day‚Äù, to which giant do we go?</p>

<h4 id="the-different-approaches-we-have"><strong>The different approaches we have</strong></h4>
<p>One might be to be blatantly state a falsifiable hypothesis, followed by experiments to test it. Another approach might be to start writing about it, understand what I would like from it, form the parameters around it collect data and look for patterns. I am not as skilled as to just start making a hypothesis and so am a follow the second approach.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-we-want"><strong>What do we want?</strong></h4>

<p>Ultimately, With this current seed of thought I have received a year and a half back, I would like to first figure out what I need to do. When in the path of figuring out what I need to do, I discover several things that are wrong with me, I would like to write about what is wrong with me and how I plan to improve it and measure it. There are so many questions I need answered, such as ‚Äúwhat is the best way for making shit loads of money?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is the direction of work I should go into?‚Äù, or some more ambitious problems. I would like to go on to make critical decisions in places like, what I do with my money and how I spend it as well. I cant waste time or procrastinate on youtube, facebook and the like. I should be learning skills and solving problems.</p>

<p>With writing I would like to solve more problems, clarify or explain more arguments, and tear apart beliefs with evidence. I would like to apply the scientific method day in and day out. I would like to become more and more r-word. I would like to work more on writing and related stories and less on social media websites. I would like to enjoy writing. I would like to feel great after writing as well.</p>

<h4 id="the-first-three-days-data"><strong>The first three days data</strong></h4>

<p>I usually start late by 9 pm, procrastinate until then. Watch a lot of youtube in between and so on. Just manage to finish 600 words, read it once and check it if it ‚Äúok‚Äù and then move on. Sometimes like now, my intention is to just clock 600 words, say grace and sleep. I start at 9 only because I know this will take time and I will not be able to sleep early enough and have issues at work the next day. I often times look at the number of words I need to write more. Some things need research, and I tend to skip all such topics due to lack of time. For example, I would like to write about Martin Seligman, and research into what exactly he means by stuff. I feel bad that I will be judged later for this lackluster work during this week.</p>

<p>I am afraid I am doing very well in measuring the means and not the end. This has potential to end up having done well in the means and poorly in the end.</p>

<h4 id="parameters-to-log"><strong>Parameters to log</strong></h4>

<p>With this I would like to come to the parameters I would like to log, in an attempt to discover patterns, what works and doesn‚Äôt.
When I start the work, when I finish, time I have used the cell phone for ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù, feeling during the writing, feeling at the end of writing.</p>

<h4 id="proposal"><strong>Proposal</strong></h4>

<p>I just hate this now, and because I will loose money, I will go ahead and complete this experiment. For the future I would like to propose, that I am banned from activity on facebook from 7 to 10:30, and that I write 300 words a day. The goal being as always that I am initiated to write early climbing on the shoulders of giants.</p>
