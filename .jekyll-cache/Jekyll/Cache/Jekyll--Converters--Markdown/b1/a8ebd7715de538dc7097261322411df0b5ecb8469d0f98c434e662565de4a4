I"¥ <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Based on <a href="/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html">this</a> article, I have almost decided to take up Data
Sciences. With this blog, I hope to find and justify the use of a
particular course.</p>

<h2 id="what-am-i-looking-for">What am I looking for</h2>

<p>I am looking for a course on which I can spend ~6x20 hrs (120 hrs) to
learn DS. I just want a course where I can follow said material in an
ordered way to get a grip of the basics of DS. This is how I want to
start. I hope this is enough to already start applying for jobs in DS.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To get an entry-level job you usually need basic familiarity with a
statistical programming language like R or Python, statistics, basic
machine learning algorithms, database systems and data communication
and visualization. - 80k hours career guide</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will find courses and run it by my DS friend.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">Roman Duda of 80k suggests this coursera course for ultra
beginners</a>. It is the same as the 10 set capstone project suggested
in quora, and looks like a good to start. Costs are about 40â‚¬/
month. I hope to finish it in less than 2 months.</p>

<p>There is a coarse <a href="http://cs109.github.io/2015/">CS109</a> for DS by Harvard. Surprisingly all the
<a href="http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html">lectures and slides</a> are available. The <a href="http://cs109.github.io/2014/index.html">Assignments from 2013 and
2014</a> along with solutions are available as well (bottom of the
page). There are some videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0-KaiZFXBlGOFN71YsEV8g/videos">here</a> made by cs109 for tutoring on
some small parts like git etcâ€¦ This seems to cost 0â‚¬.</p>

<p>A course by udacity known as the <a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002">Data analyst nano degree</a> costs
about 550â‚¬ for a 160 hr (30% off with code UMQXGK87482XHCN, So the
cost should come to 385â‚¬).</p>

<p>This <a href="http://qr.ae/TUIJ91">quora answer on DS resources</a> seems to be very informative,
regarding where to learn basics, where to get data from. The same
question has developed an <a href="http://qr.ae/TUIJ9N">answer wiki</a> which also contains
multiple sources for doing things. The way the answer is formed is
that we quickly learn some basics and get into doing projects and
learning from there.</p>

<p>Should I just start with projects? What projects do I do? Or which
course do I then take?</p>

<p>As per the suggestion of a friend in DS I take the Courseera course
and finish it and see where it takes me.</p>

<p>Why financial aid?</p>

<p>I earn 40k euros, I pay a lot of tax and have a huge loan from studies
to pay. In addition to this I give 10% of my income (4k Euros/year) to
Effective Altruism Charities. My budget is so tight that I am able to
spend on things like vacations as I also need to have some runway, in
case I lose my job. I want to do this course over 1-1.5 years as I
have a full time job (~10hrs per day) and also need to work on a
project related to Effective altruism. I do not have 600-900 $ for the
course. My current job is in a startup and I am not sure this job is
going to last long, so I want to move to DATA Science by next year. I
am also moving into Data Science as the skills I get there are the
ones needed by Effective Altruism Organizations such as Give Well and
80k hours. I hope to work in those organizations within the next 5
years.</p>

<p>Align with career goals?</p>

<p>As said above, I see this course offering me a road into the life of
Data Science. There are a lot of jobs I see available and I hope to
get a stable job in Data science and gain lots of flexible career
capital by improving in statistics, critical thinking and programming
with which I want to move into Effective Altruism Organizations over a
period of 5 years. I am very keen on the Effective Altruism Movement
and I am positive this course will align me in that direction.</p>

<p>Loan?</p>

<p>I donâ€™t mind getting a loan, but I am not stable enough right now to
pay it. I donâ€™t know if I would be in the future as well. If you
suggest starting the course and paying once I successfully port to DS,
then I am very much interested in the loan. Thank You for considering
my application.</p>
