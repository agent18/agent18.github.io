I"â<p><em>I am deeply grateful to Aaron Gertler who reviewed this article for
over 3hrs atleast (I donâ€™t know the upper bound). His comments were
very thorough (he didnâ€™t leave any hyperlink unclicked). He managed to
question several of my claims. I have updated parts of this post based
on his comments. I also want to thank STM, Carrick Flynn, Peter Hurford,
<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/ea-applicant">EA Applicant</a>, Jon Behar, Ben West, 80,000 hours for helping me
directly or indirectly. They provided valuable info in their
posts/comments/email which I have used in this article. That said,
again, they should not be viewed as endorsing anything in this. All
mistakes are mine. All views are mine.</em></p>
