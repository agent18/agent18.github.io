I"<p>From September 5th until December 1st I had been training almost 5
times a week, including cardio of 20 mins and lifting weights. I fell
sick for a week and then left to India for about 5 weeks. I was sick
here on and off (acidity, food poisoning, lot of drinking, fried food,
sleepless nights etc…). I still did manage to workout ~2 times a
week amidst all the struggles.</p>

<p><strong>back</strong></p>

<p>I am back in Delft and the first thing I notice is that I wake up with
some excruciating pain in my back. I have never had so much upperback
pain (between my shoulder bones), when I woke up. It continued for a
few days to the point that I would for sure wake up at 5 am and then
not be able to sleep and then roughly sleep and feel weak and go to
work. I still managed to work out 4-5 times a week. The pain I had
lasted for an hour before vanishing for the entire day.</p>

<p><strong>shoulder</strong></p>

<p>I was a happy kid at the gym, doing all exercises as prescribed by
<a href="http://scoobysworkshop.com/intermediate-workout-plan/">Scooby</a>. The flys I remember right from the beginning were causing
problems. I continued to do them until a point came when it was too
much. This was again after I came back on Jan 15 less than 2 months
ago. I stopped the flys. I remember trying machine exercises for the
flys and feeling better.</p>

<p>I continued doing other exercises, but then the press started to show up
with problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What will I do, if I can’t workout. Where will I get this feeling again! OMG!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I went to the physio</p>

<h2 id="the-pain-intensifies">The pain intensifies</h2>

<p><strong>Back</strong></p>

<p>She relaxed my muscles in the back, told me they were stiff, gave me
some exercises. On and off I felt pain. I thought I had it figured
out when I slept a Little lower in my bed and didn’t feel much pain
for a few days. Atleast I didn’t wake up in the with excruciatingly pain
in the morning.</p>

<p>Changed the mattress, put the mattress on the ground, I still wake up
with pain on my back. Nowadays, I feel my shoulder bones doing
something weird while I am at work. I feel some pain.</p>

<p>Over the last three days I see that as long as I prop my pillow in a
particular way, such that my head is higher, I don’t feel pain. I
suspect I had a nice high raised pillow back in India too.</p>

<p>Anomaly is that I have been sleeping in this bed for 4-5 months, and
suddenly after I skipped a month, I feel excruciating pain.</p>

<p><em>What changed?</em></p>

<p><em>And Why is sticking with me for so long?</em></p>

<p><em>Is it good to sleep like that?</em></p>

<p>Over the last year I have come to squat with 70kg, inclined leg press
about 160 kg, press about 32kg(total), and do 3 pushups, and bicep
curl whit 8kgs one hand, and last deadliest with ~60kg. I started to
believe I am that kid who with caution and slow form will not get
injured. I overcame all the <a href="/how-I-cured-my-rsi.html">fallacies in my head regarding pain</a>
and was on a sweet road to success, but what happened?</p>

<h2 id="physio">Physio</h2>

<p><strong>shoulder</strong></p>

<p>Its been 3 weeks since I did what my physio has said. I might be seeing
improvement with that I am atleast able to one push up.</p>

<p>Should I increase weights with time? What is acceptable pain? How
should I go forward with the exercises she gave me?</p>

<p><strong>back</strong></p>

<p>She basically washed her hands off of what she can do for me and
suggested another guy who is a bone guy or whatever to fix me. I am
tired of spending money uselessly.</p>

<p>Right now as I am on the table my cent re upper back is hurting(not too
much pain, but hurting nevertheless).</p>

<p>I stopped doing squats with weights over my shoulder due to fear that
it could be the cause for the pain I feel while at the computer.</p>

<p><em>could this part, this little tiny part, where it hurts when am at the
computer be because of stress?</em></p>

<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>

<p>Anyways the name of the game is called logging.</p>

<p>I want to log when all I exercise. I want to log the pain I feel at
excercise. I want to log when I feel pain where.</p>

<p>Using excel could be it as I am on the computer most of the times.</p>

<p>You are nothing without logging.</p>

<p>The last time I logged for checking my lactose intolerance, the
eveidence was aplenty, what caused me my intolerance.</p>

<p>So I did!</p>
