<p>The plan of this essay is to look <a href="/Classifying-failures-1-DP10.html">here</a>, for where all I sucked in
this practice session, and then take some of those cases and try some
‚Äúhigh repetition‚Äù.</p>

<p>With this essay I take on identifying the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When a claim is a belief</li>
  <li>When a claim cannot be tested</li>
  <li>Some special cases of splitting the Subject Predicate where I
failed.</li>
  <li>Working on claims that have adjectives in them.</li>
</ul>

<p>With every new section I start of with one example where I failed and
then carry on with the practice.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The link shown above, is not fully edited, but it was my
manual attempt to classify all the errors according to patterns.</p>

<p>With every claim there is a checklist. The checklist in this essay
looks like this: The first line has the following format:
‚ÄúDoes-it-have-examples?; Is the claim true or false?‚Äù. The second line
contains marks to identify the type of claim, marks if I failed, or
marks if I am unsure or if it took too much time etc‚Ä¶ This will
become clear with the actual excercise hopefully. This is used for
word processing in the terminal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Checklist</strong>: no; neither;<br />
<em>no-example</em>; <em>failed</em>; <em>future-with-no-ex</em>; <em>unsure</em>;
<em>future-with-example</em>; <em>failed</em>;</p>

<p>This is a predicate based on his beliefs about what is right
and wrong, not on empirical examples. ‚ÄúCrime does not pay‚Äù is a
predicate about the world and it would be false if the average crime
led to a lot of money without imprisonment. ‚ÄúCrime should not pay‚Äù can
be skipped for now. (‚ÄúThe Holy B says that crime should not pay‚Äù is
testable, though.)</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the afternoon of May, 6, 2010, US equity markets were already
down 4% on worries about the European debt crisis. At 2:32 p.m., a
large seller (a mu- tual fund complex) initiated a sell algorithm to
dispose of a large number of the ¬≠E-Mini S&amp;P 500 futures contracts
to be sold off at a sell rate linked to a measure of
minute-to-minute liquidity on the exchange. These contracts were
bought by algorithmic high-frequency traders, which were programmed
to quickly eliminate their temporary long positions by selling the
contracts on to other traders. With demand from fundamental buyers
slacking, the algorithmic traders started to sell the E-Minis
primarily to other algorithmic traders, which in turn passed them on
to other algorithmic traders, creating a ‚Äúhot potato‚Äù effect driving
up trad- ing volume‚Äî¬≠this being interpreted by the sell algorithm as
an indicator of high liquidity, prompting it to increase the rate at
which it was putting E-Mini contracts on the market, pushing the
downward spiral. At some point, the high-frequency traders started
withdrawing from the market, drying up liquidity while prices con-
tinued to fall. At 2:45 p.m., trading on the E-Mini was halted by an
automatic circuit breaker, the exchange‚Äôs stop logic
functionality. When trading was restarted, a mere five seconds
later, prices stabilized and soon began to recover most of the
losses. But for a while, at the trough of the crisis, a trillion
dollars had been wiped off the market, and spillover effects had led
to a substantial number of trades in in- dividual securities being
executed at ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù prices, such as one cent or 100,000
dollars. After the market closed for the day, representatives of the
exchanges met with regulators and decided to break all trades that
had been executed at prices 60% or more away from their pre-crisis
levels (deeming such transactions ‚Äúclearly erroneous‚Äù and thus
subject to post facto cancellation under existing trade rules). ‚Äî
