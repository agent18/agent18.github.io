      <p>You need to break down the ‚Äúphrase‚Äù even further. Instead of
‚Äúdesigned specifically to improve performance‚Äù, which has two
main parts, make it ‚Äúdesigned specifically‚Äù and ‚Äúimprove
performance‚Äù. That way, for ‚Äúimprove performance‚Äù, you get to

Fine-grained feedback as opposed to ‚Äúin‚Äù and ‚Äúout‚Äù.)</p>

  <p>Mission #6: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, would be to
clarify material that genuinely confuses you. (Did your spider-sense
start tingling for the last two phrases? It should have.)</p>

  <p>Primary target: Some work-related document that you need to understand
thoroughly but currently don‚Äôt. Take it apart almost word-by-word and
provide a <em>concrete</em> example for each one.</p>

  <p>For example, ‚Äúhabeas corpus‚Äù sounds like a confusing legal term. But
once I‚Äôve seen an example for it
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus#Examples), I know it
pretty well and can follow along when I hear it in another case. Even
somebody who has no idea of the jargon can understand by looking at
the concrete example. Note that the theoretical definition (‚ÄúHabeas
corpus is a recourse in law through which a person can report an
unlawful detention or imprisonment to a court and request that the
court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to
bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is
lawful.‚Äù) is not good enough - it‚Äôs not a concrete example.</p>

  <p>Secondary target: Some non-technical document that you want to
understand thoroughly but currently don‚Äôt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The (analytical approach)[1] to (mechanics)[2] (in this book), unlike (vector
mechanics)[3], is based on the (concepts of energy)[4a] and (work)[4b] and
therefore provides a (better understanding)[5] of (mechanical
phenomena)[6]. (It provides)[7] at the same time a (very powerful
tool)[8] for two main reasons:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>(It)[9] (considerably simplifies)[10] the (analytical formulation)[11] of
the (motion equations)[12] for a (complex mechanical system)[13].</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>E:</strong> For the work I did on the IC engine in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291747197_Design_of_Dynamically_Loaded_Components_Using_a_Kinetostatic_Approach">this paper</a>, we find out
the equilibrium forces in the crank and piston when the crank rotates
from 0-360 degrees[2], we wrote the newton equations in XYRz for each
part and then solved all the equations simultaneously to obtain the
forces[1,7,9,11].</p>

<p><em>Can I get away with saying ‚Äúequilibrium forces‚Äù, Last time you asked
me ‚Äúwho is crank?‚Äù If this is not good enough, can you give me an
example of how this is supposed to be? :)</em></p>

<p>For the truss problem shown below: We could write the individual force
equations for each part in the XYRz (3 equations per part)[3], or we
could write one equation using the energy stored in the spring[4a] and
the work done by the force F [4b] for a small displacement d and come
to the same solution[14]. This is also called Principle of virtual
works (POVW)).</p>

<p><img src="./images/images-DP-3/truss.jpg" alt="Truss problem" /></p>

<p>When we use POVW this is the equation: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F*dy=0.5*k*dx^2</code>. It contains
stiffness, force and geometry. You see the relation between F and k,
you increase F by factor 2 then k needs to be increased by factor 2 as
well [6] when all else is the same! With Vector mechanics we would
have 6 equations (Œ£FX=0,Œ£FY=0,Œ£M=0‚Äì2x). Once we solve them we have a
relation like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(geometry, reaction force, internal force,
stiffness)=0</code>. This doesn‚Äôt allow to the see the increase in F by a
factor 2 and its subsequent increase in the stiffness by factor 2[5].</p>

<p>In vector mechanics, we have 6 equations and in POVW we have 1
equation[8,10] (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F*dy=0.5*k*dx^2</code>)[12] for this truss problem [13].</p>

<p>Consider a double pendulum system[13]. They are dynamic in nature
(position of the masses changes with time). As opposed to 6 equations
we have 2 equations [10] which describe the position information using
a differential equation like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m*l^2*\\ddot(\\theta) +
mgl*sin(\\theta)</code> [12] while using POVW.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>(It)[14] (gives rise)[15] to (approximate numerical methods)[16] for the
solution of both (discrete)[17] and (continuous)[18] systems in the
most (natural manner)[19].</li>

<p><strong>P:</strong> gives rise in natural manner [15,19]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> For <a href="https://mathinsight.org/ordinary_differential_equation_introduction_examples">simple differential equations</a> it is possible to get the
solution. But for systems like the Navier-Stokes equations <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-solve-every-differential-equation-in-this-world">it is
impossible to solve without many assumptions</a>. Thus we need
something else.[15,19]</p>

  <p>Let us consider (a particle of mass m)[1], (submitted to a force field <strong>X</strong>)[2]

</blockquote>

<p>Imagine a pendulum[1] pulled to a height h from its rest position and
let go of. The gravitational force acts on it[2]. In the vertical
direction you have the weight of the mass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mg</code> [3]. The forces are
defined in a frame such that if the pendulum is in its mean position
(with 0 net force) then is does not accelerate [4].</p>

<p>When the pendulum is pulled to a height and let go of, the pendulum is
in dynamic equilibrium[5]. When it is stationary at the mean position it
is in static equilibrium. D‚ÄôAlhembert‚Äôs form is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F-ma=0</code>
form [6].</p>

<p><em>‚Äúdynamic equilibrium‚Äù, means for me that I can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F=ma</code> equation
at every instance but I don‚Äôt know how else to give an example to
explain it</em></p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Displacement of a particle[7]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> When the pendulum moves from mean position to 90 degree position
the displacement in horizontal direction is length of the pendulum.</p>

<p><em>After this things got way too complicated with the text so I stopped
there, as it was taking too much time and I was getting no where</em></p>

<p><strong>P:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Let us next imagine that the (particle)[1] follows during the time interval
[t1 , t2 ] a (motion trajectory ui*)[2] (distinct from the real one)[3]
ui. This (allows us)[4] to define the (virtual displacement of the particle)[5]
by the relationship (figure 1.1)</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong>
The pendulum[1] moves from the mean position to say 90 degrees (B) to the
right (ui). ui* is when the pendulum ball takes any other route to
B[2,3]. The difference between these 2 is the virtual displacement.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> comprehension</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> If you apply a current to a coil you will see a magnetic field. You
bring a magnetic material close to the coil it will get attracted

<p><strong>E:</strong> Maxwell‚Äôs equation derivation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations [2]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Physics can only go so deep, it cannot tell you why the
current carrying coil in the doorbell[5,11] creates the magnetic
field[3,4]. It can only tell you that the Maxwell‚Äôs laws[6,7] inform the
creation of magnetic field from electric field[8].</p>

<p>If you jump off a building YOU WILL FALL DOWN[10], so you don‚Äôt jump
off the building [9].</p>

<p>For example, if you look at data science in Google, you learn
programming, statistics, maths, and you learn about the industry
(cars, phones, clothing) you are working in[1,4]. These skills are
expected to become <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/#career-capital">increasingly valuable</a> in the the future across
wide range of industries (Phones, Cars, clothing, supermarkets
etc‚Ä¶)[2]. So if you wanted to go into an NGO like GIVEWELL[3], the
skills learned could allow you to migrate into that sector.</p>

<p><em>‚Äúlearn about the industry‚Äù is vague?</em></p>

<p>My colleagues at work helped me find jobs by giving me a list of
companies to apply to [5].</p>

<p>Working at Google or BCG, or Mckinsey is already a Green Flag on your
CV. People respect you just for that [6].</p>

<p><em>Is this not an example? Are you going to ask me what is a ‚Äúgreen

<p>My cousin is 40 years old and is doing sales in Dubai, he is
constantly having to be on his toes to make connections[1] which will
allow him to make new sales. On the other spectrum if he doesn‚Äôt make
connections he might lose his job and come back to India[2,3].</p>

<p>Learning a language at the age of 40 is much harder than when you
are 25. After 30 it is hard to learn new skills [4] (Source: Talent is
Overrated).</p>

<p>Now I am 27, and I am learning Data Science, working on ‚Äúcritical

the best possible position in the future (working at GiveWell or start
my own NGO)[5].</p>

<p><a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/#3-develop-a-valuable-transferable-skill">Peter</a> was majoring in political science when he was 22[1]. He was
inclined to make a big difference in this world[3], but he didn‚Äôt know
how. He could do law, charity work or programming[2]. He chose
computer programming as it would give him lot of income to donate and
a transferable skill[4,5]. If he didn‚Äôt like it, it would be easier
for him to switch into an NGO to do charity work[6]. But not the other
way around. The organization he works for gives him skills in
programming business and finance [7], this seems to ensure he can work
for organizations like Google, Tesla, Walmart, Facebook, and even

<p>At my current job, I am a design engineer. My skills are designing to
position parts within a few microns, troubleshooting and customer
support [1,2]. I work on variety of different projects like designing
modules for clamping of a wafer, and designing stages that accelerate
at 40g‚Äôs [2a]. I am able to make my own designs with little help from
senior designers in 5 years time[3]. The different skill types are
transferable skills, knowledge and personality traits [4]. I can
transfer my design skills to other high-tech companies like Philips in
Medical[5]. With the knowledge of the lithography industry I am able
to move to sales[6]. At my previous company I sucked a lot, I was
allowed to ask dumb questions. I didn‚Äôt even know how to design a part
for milling. But I was softly pointed out my flaws and I pulled
through quite well after that. Now when I have recent hires to mentor,
I make sure I extend the same kindness I was offered [7].</p>

<p><em>Does troubleshooting, customer support work for you? why? and why
not? Do you think these need examples? When I say troubleshooting, I

<p><strong>P:</strong> useful</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> programming, and marketing skills can be used in every single
sector, and are the least risk of getting automated</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> personal productivity</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> When I really need to focus, and time is of the essence, I switch
off my phone, switch on leechblock to block sites like youtube and
linkedin, and go to the silent room in the library with ear plugs. The
days when I invariably clock the most hours (10.5 hrs even) is with
this above setup [9]. There is not a case in history where I did 6 hrs
say when I was at home and didn‚Äôt have the above setup.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> analysis and problem-solving</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> At work I am often given a task which starts with a problem: ‚Äúthere
is leak in the vacuum chamber‚Äù. My objective would be to identify why
there is leak (‚ÄúMake experiments to check if the leak is virtual or
due to a faulty connection‚Äù)[10] and then propose solutions to
overcome it (‚Äúreplace connection and retry‚Äù)[11].</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> ability to learn quickly</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Following <a href="https://80000hours.org/2013/04/how-to-improve-your-memory/">spaced repetition</a>. For example, reviewing 100 flash
cards of GRE words and meanings everyday.[12]</p>

Alias paradox</p>

<p>1A: 24k with 100% certainty
1B: 33/34 chance if winning</p>

<p>2A: 34% chance of winning 24k
2B: 33% chance of winning 27k</p>

<p>Choosing 1B and 2B makes sense as they are equivalent and are the
highest $$.</p>

<p><em>Is this not an example? why? what would be an example? A real
decision that I made overcoming my bias would be the right example?</em></p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> social skills<br />
<strong>E:</strong> ability to sustain conversation with someone you met (not awkward
silence).</p>

<p><em>This seems to be a hard one, I can think of real life examples like
friends I have? Can you show me an example for this? I think what I
have written is an explanation (theory)</em></p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> A colleague of mine is a support technician, in my view a real dumb
dumb when it comes to understanding tech. But he is extremely
social. He is capable of having long conversations with anybody even
the CEO of my company (yes a support technician). He is 38 and got
invited to parties of girl students(22) who work part time in my
company.</p>

<p><em>I think the above is an example.</em></p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> management</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> My boss at work, has 8 people under him. Everyone has a task to
do. For example, I was asked to work on the calculations for the
module, another on the design and another on the electrical parts
etc‚Ä¶ In addition he also communicates with other teams to make sure
the module we make interfaces with modules other teams make.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We cover(why)[16] and (how to learn them)[17] in a later article.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Why (to learn transferable skills)</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Jobs like programming, management are the safest jobs not at the risk
of automation. <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/#which-jobs-are-best-early-career">Source</a>.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> how to learn them</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> By means of Deliberate Practice. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8RXei5Jn3Q&amp;t=638s">Here</a> is an example of someone
improving their shot percentage of 3 pointers from ~25% to ~40% over 4
weeks.</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If (you want)[18] (to do good)[19], you also (need)[20] to (learn
all about)[21] the (world‚Äôs most pressing problems)[22] and (how to
solve them)[23].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Donating atleast 10% of your salary[18] to EA organizations [19]</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> need</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> ??</p>

<p><em>thought for a while and left it</em></p>

<p><strong>P:</strong>(learn all about)[21]</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> I read the entire career guide of 80k hours atleast 2-5 times and in
the end wrote a 21k word article about my decision based on it</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> world‚Äôs most pressing problems</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> AI risks, Promoting EA, Global priorities research, developing
world health [22]</p>

</blockquote>

<p>My friend currently works in Apple after he had an ivy league
schooling in the US. Previously he worked in Mu Sigma a company in
India, catering to the fortune 500 in the field of Data
Science[24b]. He and several others who left their job in Mu Sigma 2
years later, are in some kickass positions now in the US[24a,24]. He
often worked long hours and was under a lot of pressure to
deliver[25,26] for the fortune 500 companies. Even on holiday trips he
had his laptop to do meetings to make changes or inform his
findings[27,28].</p>

<p><em>squeezed lots of feedback together? Should have I done it separately?
can you show me how?</em></p>

<blockquote>

time with)[8] also (shape your character)[9].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few months back the company I used to work for went bankrupt. At
that time everyone was searching for jobs. People I had interacted
with related to work[2] and while having lunch[3], openly discussed
with each other where we are applying for jobs. They gave suggestions
on where to find companies and what companies they were applying
to[4,5]. My immediate boss gave me a recommendation and contact to speak
with which lead me to getting multiple interviews within the same
company[4,5]. I had met someone high up in the management ladder of another
company a few years back. I called him up directly and re-introduced
myself and got some great advice on where to look for jobs[5]. Another
colleague gave me a list of companies he had gotten from a bigshot to
apply to[4,5].</p>

<p><em>squeezed ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúfind opportunities‚Äù together? how would I split
it and what are the questions you ask yourself to come up with an
example in this case?</em></p>

<p>My co-conspirator in the US constantly introduces me to new ideas on
life such as deliberate practice and effective altruism[6]. He does
this by way of giving me missions [6a] to complete under some strict
deadlines. Right now I am allocating a few hrs a day towards
Deliberate practice[7]. In tandem I am half way through the Coursera
course on Data Science[7].</p>

<p>Persuasion is real. I was once unfortunately third wheeling 2 couples
on new years[8]. One of the couples could not stop PDAing. We went out
for the fireworks and it made me feel so alone. I think I was fine
until I saw this shit[9]. Wanting to have a girlfriend peaked at that
time[9]. I was visibly sad or wanted to retreat into my shell!
HaHa. But now I think I am ok! Grinding and deeply thinking about the
concepts of 80k hours and reading about what people in the EA
community are doing[8] is filling me with more desire to be like
them[9] and not like those cuddly PDA-showing
not-caring-about-the-world couples!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For both reasons, it‚Äôs (important)[11] to (make connections)[12] who
are (influential)[13] and (who care about social impact)[14].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My colleagues informed me companies I could apply to, so that I can
get a job[11]. Engaging with an STM and the EA community is allowing
me to focus on deliberate practice[11] which is expected to make me
earn top $$ (200k in the next few years) or save 1000s of lives.</p>

<p>Talking to people at work, about design or just making jokes, drinking
beer with them seems to make solid connections. (I went to this guy for
so many tough questions I had to deal with. I drank with him till the
end on some occasions. I thanked him for all his support when mapper
went bankrupt, and he was touched by it. I just ask him for advice to
this day and he responds)[12]. He now has his own consultancy, with a
few more years of experience I could work for him[13].</p>

<p>People who care about social impact: STM, EA community, 80k hours,
Founders pledge, Elon Musk, Peter Singer, GiveWell :) [14]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Credentials)[1] ‚Äì will (this job act as)[2] (a good signal)[3] to (future
collaborators)[4] or (employers)[5]? Note that we don‚Äôt just mean (formal
credentials)[6] like having a law degree[6], but also your (achievements)[7] and
(reputation)[8]. If you‚Äôre a writer, it‚Äôs the (quality)[9] of your blog. If
you‚Äôre a coder, it‚Äôs your GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Masters degree, an award recognizing your work in the company, a
scholarship are some credentials [1]. Due to the bankruptcy of the
previous company I worked for I was looking for jobs in precision
engineering field like ASML, DEMCON [4,5]. I got about 5-8 interviews
quite easily[3], mainly by pitching my story in the previous
job[2]. Most of them converted[3]. Having a masters degree accounted
for more $$[6]. I constantly boasted with the help of my recommendation
letter, how much money I saved for the company (20k‚Ç¨ and 300 man
hours)[7], how well I performed in customer support[7], and how in one
project I was picked ahead of senior designers to do system
engineering[8].</p>

<p>In the Less Wrong community you see other people post as well; other
than Eliezer. For example when I saw this series ‚ÄúThe Science of
Winning at life‚Äù, I was excited for a second and immediately checked
the author‚Äôs credentials. He has 65k people ‚ÄúLike‚Äù his posts[9]. Ok
now I am going to read it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Runway)[1] ‚Äì (how much money will you save in this job)[2]? Your
runway is (how long)[3] you could (comfortably live)[4] with (no
income)[5]. It depends on both your (savings)[6] and how much you
could (reduce your expenses by)[7]. We (recommend)[8a] (aiming)[8] for at
least six months of runway to (maintain your financial
security)[9]. 12-18 months of runway is (even more useful)[10] because
it gives you the (flexibility)[11] to make a (major career
change)[12]. It‚Äôs (usually)[13] (worth)[14] (paying down)[14b] (high-interest
debt)[15] before (donating)[16] more than 1% per year or (taking a big pay
cut)[17] for greater impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With my previous job I could save about 6-8k [1,2]. Cost of living is
about 1200‚Ç¨ per month[4]. So I can withstand for about 6 months[3] for
every year I work, with 0‚Ç¨ income in a first world country like
Netherlands[5].</p>

<p>If I go to India I can cut it down to probably &lt;500‚Ç¨[7]. Potentially I
could stay more months with no income. With my current savings of
12k‚Ç¨[6] I could probably stay without income for more than 1.5 years
in India.</p>

<p>8k bank balance for emergencies seems to be enough for 6 months [8].</p>

<p><em>‚Äúrecommend‚Äù? no idea!</em></p>

<p>In case you lose your job then you need a few months to find a
job[9]. Typical time periods at large companies (ASML) are 2-4 months
of application process. From start to finish ASML took 2.5 months
before handing me the contract.</p>

<p>Doing an MBA would mean more $$[10] in the bank. In case I decide to
do an MBA in Netherlands full time [12], I would need to quit my job
and pursue it[11]. So 15k for basic needs for a year and 50k of
tuition loan.</p>

<p>When people come for a masters to Netherlands[13], they take a loan in
India where people pay 7-8% interest[15] every year in addition to
paying off the base. (assuming the interest does not decrease over
years) For 40L rs of loan it will take 8 years if you pay 5L base, 3L
interest[14b] and make no donation. It will take 20 years if you pay 2L
base, 3L interest and 3L donation[16]. With the first option where you
pay your debt first, over a period of 20 years you can donate ~72L
and with the second option you can donate ~60L. It seems to add
another 12L rs if debt is paid first[14].</p>

<p>In Europe I would imagine working in an EA organization will probably
start with minimum wage ~25k‚Ç¨ (a paycut of 30k‚Ç¨). This gives not much
place for savings(maybe 2-3k), This would just cover the interest in
the above case of loan from India[17]. As you also need to pay the
base, it is not recommended at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(rarely)[10] the (best)[11] (early career options)[12] if you‚Äôre
(focused on)[13] our (top problems areas)[14]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>E:</strong> If you look at the <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/">top 3 problem areas </a>[14] such as
AI, global priorities research, and promoting effective altruism, it
looks like none of them seem to need consulting or software
programming [10].</p>

<p>You can enter AI if you are really good in math heavy research,
support roles, policy and strategy. For promoting effective altruism,
working directly in EA organizations and doing internships and
volunteer work gets you inside. For global priorities research, an
economics related degree, or political science, philosophy,
decision-making helps etc‚Ä¶ [11,12] <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/">Source</a>.</p>

<p>Of the candidates featured in the 80k hours career guide,
I barely saw people with a consulting background or an MBA even, when
I surveyed it <a href="http://agent18.github.io/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html">here</a> [10].</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> focused on <strong>E:</strong> An example of ‚Äòbeing focused on‚Äô is Niel Bowerman
working on AI policy all the way from a PhD in climate physics. His
focus being on creating maximum impact (saving max lives)[13].</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead, (it seems like)[15a] (most people)[15] (should focus)[15b]
on (entering a priority path)[16] (directly)[17], or (perhaps)[18]

</blockquote>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Niel Bowerman works for AI policy now[16], from PhD in climate
physics [15b]. He got in touch with great people in the community
while being an advocate for climate change. This way he entered the
community and today he is AI Policy specialist at 80k hours[17]. He
didn‚Äôt do an MBA or programming before getting into the priority
path[17]. On the other hand<a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/dillon-bowen/">Dillon</a> was going to pursue an
economics PhD to work on the priority paths [19] later.</p>

<p>Most people who applied or reported their career change to 80k hours
[15],showed interest in consulting rather than directly into the
priority paths[15]. Instead, according to <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/">80k hours research</a>
[15a], they should be working directly on the priority paths[15b].</p>

<p><em>most people, how do I quantify it, I don‚Äôt have any data? Maybe I
should dig into 80k hours?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We think there are several misunderstandings going on:</p>

  <p>There‚Äôs a (difference)[0] between (narrow)[1] and (flexible career
capital)[2].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>P:</strong> flexible career capital</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Peter 22, works for a firm that needs his programming skills and
also learns about finance and management at work. So he has the option
in the future to move into 3 different kinds of paths and into
multiple sectors(Banks, automobile, EA organizations) and likely to
keep his job from the risk of automation.</p>

<p><strong>E2:</strong> Doing Data science gives you skills in programming, ‚Äúproblem
solving‚Äù, statistics and detailed knowledge of the industry you work
in (for example, if you are in self-driving cars, then you learn about
that industry and how it works as well‚Äù)</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> Narrow career capital</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Working in a non-profit straight out of university</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> difference</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Kate ended up returning to the corporate sector for several years,
and would have ended up ahead if she‚Äôd done that straight away
(without starting at a non-profit straight out of university).</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúWould have ended up ahead‚Äù? Not good enough?</em></p>

<p>Hard to build up runway for a 6 months by working for a year, as you
will be earning 50k$ when you begin.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs <a href="https://80000hours.org/2015/09/what-do-leaders-of-effective-non-profits-say-about-working-in-non-profits-interviews-with-givedirectly-deworm-the-world-initiative-development-media-international-schistosomiasis-control-initiativ/">widely accepted in the non-profit sector</a> that it‚Äôs easier to
switch from a business job to a non-profit job than vice versa. So if
you‚Äôre unsure between the two, a business position offers more
flexibility. <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/#which-jobs-are-best-early-career">Source</a></p>

<p><strong>P:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Narrow career capital)[3a] is useful for a (small number of
paths)[3], while (flexible career capital)[3b] is useful in a (large
number)[4].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Working at EAO‚Äôs[3a] keeps you well positioned for senior positions
in EA organizations. One can move in wide range of sectors but only
within the EA community[3]. For example, Neil Bowerman, started with
Climate Change and now is in freaking AI policy[3]. While working in
data science[3b] can lead to job switches in several sectors (mobiles
phones, self-driving cars, food-chains, supermarkets, clothing and
EAO‚Äôs)[4].</p>

<p>The technical skills you develop also open the possibility to
transition into different roles including software engineering,
founding or joining early-stage startups, academia,2 and quant
finance. <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/#career-capital">Source</a>[4]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you‚Äôre (focused on)[5] our (top problem areas)[6], (narrow career
capital in those areas)[7] is (usually)[8a] (more useful)[8] than
(flexible career capital)[9].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>E:</strong> Niel Bowerman was interested in climate advocacy[6] and pursued it
seriously and got several connections within the EA community[5]. He
ended up getting impressive achievements such as founding a think
tank[8]. He works now on AI policy[6] which he was able to use and
transfer his skills, reputation and connections into[7,8]. Contrast
this to him having taken up a job in Software Engineering [9].</p>

<p><em>I think ‚Äúusually‚Äù[8a] is not covered in the above! How would you write
an example for ‚Äúusually‚Äù in this context?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Consulting)[10A] (provides flexible career capital)[10], which means (it‚Äôs
not top overall)[11] unless you‚Äôre (very uncertain)[12] about (what
to aim for)[13].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following work at Mckinsey[10A], people tend to occupy chief of staff
positions for senior/influential public official or become people of
the top management for large companies like Google. They also work on
strategy team for companies like Google, or work on the front lines
where they served as consultants, policy, private/equity etc‚Ä¶ The
options seem to be a lot [10]. I <a href="./Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html">estimate here</a> that working for
an EAO like 80k hours (with the ‚Äúright skills and intention‚Äù it is
definitely possible, I think I can get in if I spend a ‚Äúfew years‚Äù on
my ‚Äúskills‚Äù) could save 1100 lives, where as the best case scenario of
becoming a consultant‚Äî a partner‚Äî seems to save 1050 lives not
including any probabilities of getting there (thumbs down for
consulting)[11].</p>

<p><strong>P:</strong> very uncertain</p>

<p><strong>E:</strong> You don‚Äôt know if you can handle the stress of an Investment
banking/trading job, so you need to try something similar to see if
you are a good fit for it[12]. Hence you do not know if you want to Earn
to give or work directly [13].</p>

<p><strong>E2:</strong> My friend was 26 when he decided to do a masters in computer
science in the US. He didn‚Äôt know if he was up for AI research (say at
MIRI)[12] or if he should earn-to-give (say at Google).[13]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can get (good)[14a] (career capital)[14] in (positions with high
immediate impact)[15] (especially problem-area specific career
capital)[16], including (most of those we recommend)[17].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tara gained skills in managing and making efficient[14,17] processes
while working at hospitals and with the RedCross. She managed to save
8m$ for the hospital in a year[14a]. This landed her the CEO position
at the Centre for Effective Altruism which seems to be Promoting
Effective Altruism[16].</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>When I was editing the text, I found that in many places, it was hard
to follow the example, what with all the numbering going
everywhere. For example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>I wrote:</strong></p>

take on even bigger tasks like becoming the CEO of Centre for

it once and did some grammar checks. I should probably spend more time
on making it readable. Atleast get 2 revisions of the text.</p>
