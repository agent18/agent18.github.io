I"i<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>An Economics PhD is considered by 80k hours as one of the most
important things one can do, given certain attributes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you have a high chance of landing a good research job in academia or
policy ‚Äì promising areas for social impact ‚Äì and you have back-up
options in the corporate sector since the skills you learn are
in-demand (unlike many PhD programs).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-do-you-need">What do you need?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>165+ GRE score; 160+ is still not good!</li>
  <li>3.5 GPA or higher especially in economics and mathematics degrees</li>
  <li>Killer letters of recommendation from people known in the field</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not from Economics or a Mathematics UG, it is still
possible to get a PhD from the US. Some advice is given <a href="https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/">here</a>. The
bottom line is that we need transition years to either do another
masters followed by some research before applying or at least do a
diploma (1-3) years transitioning for a 5-7 year economics
PhD. Apparently this is the scene in Harvard even.</p>

<p>US PhD‚Äôs are the ones to aim for according to 80k hours. One of the
reasons for going for a US PhD instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Funding for post-graduate study in the UK is highly uncertain at each
stage even if you are really good.</p>

<h2 id="academia-and-real-world">Academia and real world</h2>

<p>In case shit hits the roof, getting a job in the real world is
apparently easy as evident by the statistics. This field has the least
un-employment rates as compared to any other field</p>

<p>More than 50% go into academia with a decent median salary of 108k$.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Academic jobs: 
You can do research on high priority cause areas, like ending extreme
poverty (see e.g. MITs Poverty Action Lab) or cause prioritization
(e.g. in support of the work of the Copenhagen Consensus).</p>
