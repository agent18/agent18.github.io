I"ê<h2 id="pain-begins">Pain begins</h2>

<p>A few months back, I started having this pain in my back and
shoulder. I went to the physio, with for 4 weeks and have nothing to
show of it.</p>

<p>In <a href="/pain-journal.html">this post</a> I discuss the origin of the pain. Since then I made
a google doc, so that I could log my pain easily.</p>

<p>With this post, I would like to answer the following:</p>

<p>For shoulder and back, individually.</p>

<p>Am I getting better?</p>

<p>What is causing this pain?</p>

<p>How were the last 7 days?</p>

<p>Different regions and places of pain, even after completely quitting
upper body work outs</p>

<p>Should I quit squats and deadlifts?</p>

<p>Was squats the reason for backpain?</p>

<h2 id="weeks-11-to-14">Weeks 11 to 14</h2>

<p>1-2 times leg press and deadlifts per week; 1 time basketball; 4 days
of 20 mins cardio (220cal)/ week; 3-4 times shoulder physio.</p>

<p>Stopped upperbody and squat exercises.</p>

<h2 id="hypothesis-back">Hypothesis back</h2>

<p><strong>Squats was the reason for back pain when waking up?</strong></p>

<p>In Week 11 I stop squats. I guess it was quite bad, and that‚Äôs why I
had to take the last thing that I loved doing. I still do 1-2 times/week of
legpress max and deadlifts max.</p>

<p>Also in week-2 to 3, I only did squats as opposed to doing squats once
and doing leg press the next time. I changed my grip to take it on the
shoulder instead and stopped using the cushion for the shoulder since I went
to India in week -3.</p>

<p>I sleep well nowadays, but with remanants of pain now and then show up.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Squats seems to have reduced the pain. <strong>YES</strong></p>

<p><strong>Squats the reason for remnant back pain during work?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Not sure</strong>, as they still remain from week 11 to week 14 and even
now as I write this.</p>

<p>Even this Monday I felt the need to massage the shoulders.</p>

<p><strong>Deadlifts the reason for bad back middle back?</strong></p>

<p>Already have middle back pain</p>

<p>Week 11.2 ‚Äì&gt; middle back pain + deadlift eve</p>

<p>Week 12.1 ‚Äì&gt; deadlift</p>

<p>No written middle back pain</p>

<p>Week 12.5 ‚Äì&gt;  Middle back pain in the morning. + deadlift eve</p>

<p>Week 13.2 ‚Äì&gt; Middle back pain</p>

<p>Conclusion for middle back: Seems to be not because of
deadlifts.<strong>No</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deadlifts the reason for bad back?</strong></p>

<p>2/4 days when deadlifts was done, morning wake up was higher pain than
previous day.</p>

<p>Data might be insufficient. But how about not doing it for a week?</p>

<p>Week 12.5 to 13.4 are the gaps between 2 deadlifts; is better than
Week 13.6 to 14.3. Week 13.5 I did something weird or some gas in my
left back below shoulder. Not the typical pain I experience now and
then.</p>

<p>Would like to conclude that deadlifts are fine, but I will continue to
log.</p>

<p>Therefore: <strong>YES</strong></p>

<p><strong>Did stopping upperbody workout help reduce pain in shoulders?</strong></p>

<p>Week 9.5 upper body was stopped.</p>

<p>Week 11.1 squats was stopped</p>

<p>Not sure, but I remember feeling a decent amount of strain on the shoulders
while maxing out, so I stopped. <strong>Not sure</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is basketball causing shoulder pain</strong></p>

<p>I can only comment about crazy shoulder pain when I can‚Äôt even lift a
bottle.</p>

<p>Week 12.7 ‚Äì&gt; 3 hrs of Bball
Week 13.1 to 13.3  ‚Äì&gt; cant lift 1.5 kg bottle with extended arm</p>

<p>Week 13.7 ‚Äì&gt; 3 hrs more intense ball
Week 14.1 to 14.3 ‚Äì&gt; chill</p>

<p>For now ball is ruled out of heavy pain. So <strong>NO</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Did excercise help to reduce pain?</strong></p>

<p>Not sure but sure as hell feels good.</p>

<p>I sort of max out. I still do hear clicks in my shoulder when I do
it. I will show my last work out to my Phisio.</p>

<p><strong>Number of pushups over time</strong></p>

<p>Week 12.2 ‚Äì&gt; 4 slow bent pushups ‚ÄúDont think it is doing better‚Äù</p>

<p>Week 12.4 ‚Äì&gt; 3 + 4(in pain)</p>

<p>Week 13.1 ‚Äì&gt; couldn‚Äôt lift 2 kg using right shoulder, possibly due to
bad sleeping and not 3 hr basketball.</p>

<p>Week 14.2 ‚Äì&gt; 2 sets ‚Äì&gt; 1 set all bent pushups (last 4 2ish pain)
                     ‚Äì&gt; 2nd set 3(bent) + 3 (90deg) stopped by fear.</p>

<p>Week 14.3 ‚Äì&gt; remanants of shoulder right, seen throughout the day.</p>

<p><strong>Not clear</strong> if there is improvement or degradation</p>

<p><strong>summary of regions of pain?</strong>
neck craking seen now a days from time to time, shoulder blades are
sore, can literally feel them, shoulder tops are sore from time to
time, I try to massage them, pain in right shoulder sides is more, not
during work I think.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p>Sleep well nowadays
Feels like shoulder is better sometimes</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>Shoulder blades are now visible during work hours, less at wake up
than what was in the begining</p>

<p>Am able to do more pushups, but the pain remaining the next day does
not allow me to conclude anything useful.</p>

<p>Pain in different parts of the shoulder? what to do?</p>

<p>Still sometimes hear crack while bringing down weights.</p>

<p>I neck crack nowadays.</p>

<p>Shoulder blades, upper shoudlers are sore from time to time</p>

<p>What about bandages?</p>
