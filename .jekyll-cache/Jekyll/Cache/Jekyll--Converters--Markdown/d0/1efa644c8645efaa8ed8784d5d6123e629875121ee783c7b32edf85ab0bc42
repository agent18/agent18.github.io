<p><strong>Claim</strong>: It is good for people to [1] which will [2].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is it good for people to [1] which will [2]?</p>

<p><strong>Split</strong>:</p>

<p>For [1], we think of <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nielbowerman">Niel Bowerman</a>, who is seen to work in different
organizations (CEA) in the role of fund-raising and growing organizations,</p>

<p>For [2] we think of, Niel Bowerman being able to jump right in and work
in addressing the talent gap for AI safety.</p>

<p>For good, we think of working in AI safety because it has the
potential to take down the entire world and yet has only 100 people
working on it.</p>

<!-- **97k per year** -->
<!-- (There is an estimate of [97k$ per year](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) in impact (or donations), -->
<!-- for someone working at GiveWell. We assume EAO's have similar impact.) -->

<!-- *I could give an example showing a statement where 80khours encourages -->
<!-- people as it's the "want" that is in question here. Does 80k want or -->
<!-- not. OR was I expected to just look at "it is good to work [1] that -->
<!-- will [2]?" Can you comment?* -->

<!-- [1] hr for [2] claims and [2] phrases -->

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] could involve [3].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Does [1] involve [3]?</p>

<p><strong>Split</strong>:</p>

<p>For [1], we think of Niel Bowerman working for 80khours in the role of
bringing in more people into AI safety</p>

<p>For building the EA community, we think of the same example as in [1].</p>

<p>For institutional decision making, <em>I don‚Äôt have an example</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some other issues we‚Äôve focused on in the past include (ending
factory farming)[1] and improving (health in poor
countries)[2]. They seem especially promising if you don‚Äôt think
(people can or should focus on the long-term effects of their
actions)[3].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: 80khours focused on [1] and [2] in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Has 80khours focused on [1] and [2] in the past?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: 80khours wrote <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/">articles</a> on supporting factory
farming and global poverty since 2009. But recently they call AI
safety and other existential risks as top-problems and not FF and GP.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] seem promising if you don‚Äôt think [3].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is [1], promising if you don‚Äôt think [3]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>50 billion animals die each year. 1k people are working on
it. ‚ÄúExpected value with intense efforts for the future of humanity‚Äù
is <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/#think-you-should-work-on-something-else">0.05% (average)</a>, i.e., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0005*7 billion human lives</code> i.e.,
3.5m expected human lives. Assuming that doubling the effort leads to
reducing the problem by 1%, we have,</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>3.5*E6 expected people lives * 1% / 1000 people
= 35 expected people lives in total
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Contrast this, to working in Data Science at Google in the US, I
expect <a href="/deliberate-practice.html">400 lives to be saved</a>.</p>

<p>So, does not look promising!</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [2] seems promising if you don‚Äôt think of [3].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is [2], promising if your don‚Äôt think [3]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>If one works in GiveWell, he can probably have an impact of <a href="https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/">97k$ per
year</a>. This implies he can save <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">97k$/4k$*30=727</code> lives in total of
30 years. Contrast this to working in Data Science in Google in the
US, about <a href="/deliberate-practice.html">400 lives</a> can be saved over a 30 years.</p>

<!-- [4] phrases [3] claims [1] hr -->

<blockquote>
  <p>There are (many issues)[1] we haven‚Äôt been able to look into yet, so
we expect there are other (high-impact areas we haven‚Äôt
listed)[3]. We have a (list of candidates)[4] on our (problem
profile page)[5], and we‚Äôd be excited for (people to explore some of
these as well as other areas that could have a large effect on the
long-term future.)[6] (These areas)[6a] can be (particularly worth
pursuing)[7] if you‚Äôre (especially motivated by one of them)[8]. We
cover this more in the section on ‚Äòpersonal fit‚Äô below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: There are [1], that 80khours has not looked into yet.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Are there [1], that 80khours has not looked into yet?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/">Criminal Justice Reform, medical research into how to
slow aging etc‚Ä¶</a></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: There could be other [3].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Could there be other [3]?</p>

<p><em>In this case, I could give a hypothetical example or an example from
the past? can you help with what‚Äôs good here? and why?</em></p>

<p><strong>Example from Past</strong>: Until a few years back 80khours thought that the best
places to work on were ‚Äúreducing near-term life risks aka reducing
global health risks‚Äù but when they explored that there were global
catastrophic risks that could kill the entire planet and future
generations, they have now changed their stance on where people should
be working considering the impact.</p>

<p><strong>Example Hypothetical</strong>: If medical research into ‚Äòhow to slow aging‚Äô seems
largely promising (95% chance of making it with 10b <span>$</span>
with a 100 people extra), in delivering a mechanism that doubles the
human life expectancy, it could be beneficial to work on it as it
could save <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">95% * 7b expected people lives/100 = 66m expected people
lives per person working on it</code></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: 80khours has [4] on [5].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: They have ‚Äúindividual cognition‚Äù and many others in this
page: https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: It‚Äôs a good idea for [6].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is it a good idea for [6]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>Working in DS gives an impact over 30 years of life of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>75% chance of working in US starting with 150k$ for 30 years
starting at 35 years</li>
  <li>growth of 5% average until 50 and then 2% average growth till 65</li>
  <li>10% increase every 5 years</li>
  <li>Donating 35% of salary</li>
</ul>

<p>Results in saving 530 people. <em>Previously I said 400, now I have an
updated calculation.</em></p>

<p>Instead if I get into ‚Äúpromoting effective altruism‚Äù and work on my
‚Äúpeople convincing skills‚Äù and convert only 10 people who would not have
donated to donate similar amounts as in a DS career, then it appears
that it could result in saving 5300 people. Of course this needs to be
multiplied by the probability of this actually happening which could
be as low as 10% to match the success of a career in DS saving 530
people.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: These areas can be [7], if you‚Äôre [8].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is [6a], [7], if you are [8].</p>

<p><strong>Split</strong>:</p>

<p>For [6a] we think of, working in promoting EA as in the above example.</p>

<p>For [8], we think of a personal fit of more than 50%</p>

<p>For [7], we think of an impact of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5300*50%=2650 lives</code> which is
better than working a DS job resulting in 530 net people.</p>

  <p>The (most effective careers)[1] are those that address the (most pressing

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] are those that address [2] on [3].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is [1], [2] on [3]?</p>

<p><strong>Split</strong>:</p>

<p>For [1], we think of a career in AI safety, say as a computer science
researcher in MIRI, with an impact of 57k people(derived below) saved per additional
person. Contrast this to the 530 people to be saved over a career in
DS.</p>

<p><em>It seems to be making sense finally why an STM thought donating to
MIRI was better than donating to GiveWell.</em></p>

<p>For [2], we think of the control problem in AI</p>

<p>*here double effort is assumed to mean ‚Äúmajor effort‚Äù cited in their
article</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the (same reasons)[1] we think it‚Äôs an advantage to work on (neglected

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Due to [1], it is good to work on [2].</p>

<p><em>because</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: It is advantageous to work on [2].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is it advantageous to work on [2]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>As shown above, we see that the lives saved per person per dollar is
much better for AI safety, aka a factor of 1000 better than working in
Climate Change which is not ‚Äúso neglected‚Äù(aka, 10b <span>$</span> in funding)</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: It is good to work on [3].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Why is it advantageous to work on [3]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>MIRI sends out a mail on Christmas saying that they didn‚Äôt meet their
funding goals by a few 100k <span>$</span>. Let alone adding another 100 people to solve
the most important problem (complete annihilation by 2100 with a 1-10%
chance) by 1 more percent, what about keeping the people currently
involved and trying to grow the movement?</p>

<p>For [3], we think of ‚Äòadding more people‚Äô being the most neglected
approach as there are only 100 people working on it currently and
adding another 100 will only reduce the problem by 1%.</p>

<p>For advantageous, we think of 57k lives (as above) for every
additional person added to AI safety (on average).</p>

<!-- [5] phrases [3]-[4] claims -->

<blockquote>
  <p>Given our take on (the world‚Äôs most pressing problems)[1] and the
(most pressing bottlenecks these issues face)[2], we think the
following (five broad categories of career)[3] are a good place to
(start generating ideas)[4] if (you have the flexibility to consider a
new career path)[5].</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Given [1] and [2], it appears that following [3] is a good
place for [4].</p>

<p><em>I am not sure how to give an example Given [1] and [2]. So I skip
this for now.</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: It appears that following [3], is a good place for [4].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is following [3], a good place for [4], if [5]?</p>

<p><strong>Split</strong>:</p>

<p>For [3], we think of a career in researching Climate Change</p>

<p>For [4], we think of Niel Bowerman meeting ‚ÄòGiving What we can‚Äô which
led him to go into Earning to Give in Finance, and then slowly
transitioning from there to FHI and then into AI policy with 80khours.</p>

<p>For [5], we think of Niel being able to move to finance for earning to
give.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Niel Bowerman started his career in researching climate
change where he realized that he should probably earn to give, and
moved into a career path in that direction and in the end landed with
AI policy at 80000 hours. As we have seen in the past AI safety¬†¬ª
Climate Change aka ‚Äúgood‚Äù.</p>

<h4 id="research">Research</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Many of the top problem areas we focus on)[1] are mainly (constrained by
a need for additional research)[2], and we‚Äôve argued that (research)[3] seems
like a high-impact path in general)[4].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] are mainly [2].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is [1], mainly [2]?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: There are 100 people working on AI safety, an additional
100 people will reduce the risk by 1%.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [3] seems like [4].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Working in MIRI as a researcher could save 57k lives and
has a better bang-for-the-buck as compared to Climate change (about 1000
times better).</p>

<p><em>I don‚Äôt know what general means so I skip it!</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Following this path)[8] usually means (pursuing graduate study in a
relevant area where you have good personal fit)[5], then aiming to do
(research relevant to a top problem area)[6], or else (supporting
other researchers who are doing this)[7].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [8] usually means, [5].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <a href="https://intelligence.org/team/">&gt;50% of them at MIRI</a> seem to have a graduate degree
or a PhD.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [8] usually means [6] or [7].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: For me top problem area is Climate change or AI
safety. None of the team of MIRI seem to have worked or done any
research in Climate change or AI safety before joining MIRI, or even
supporting them in some way.</p>

<p>I hereby confirm [8] doesn‚Äôt seem to mean [6] or [7].</p>

<!-- 13 in [2] hrs with [6] claims -->

<blockquote>
  <p>(Research)[1] is the (most difficult to enter of the five
categories)[2], but it has (big potential upsides)[3], and in (some
disciplines)[4], going to (graduate school)[5] gives you (useful
career capital for the other four categories)[6]. This is one reason
why if (you might be a good fit for a research career)[7], it‚Äôs
often a good path to start with though we still usually (recommend
exploring other options for 1-2 years before starting a PhD)[8]
unless (you‚Äôre highly confident you want to spend your career doing
research in a particular area)[9]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] is [2].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: I am positive MIRI does not want me with my current skill
set. I probably need to work atleast 5 years (magic number), before I can come
to the level of their research. Whereas I could already earn-to-give
to MIRI as small as the amount may be.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] has [3].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: An additional worker in places like MIRI has an impact of
57k people. This is by far the highest I have ever seen in terms of
impact. If you look at earning to give for the most money making job I
know, aka Investment Banking, you could save <a href="http://agent18.github.io/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html">3771 lives</a> at max (not
including the personal fit).</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: In [4], going to [5], gives you [6].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Jesse Liptrap from MIRI, finished his PhD in Math and was
able to work as SWE in Google (allowing him to earn-to-give). He
currently works at MIRI.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: If [7], it might be good to start directly with [1].</p>

<p><strong>Split</strong>:</p>

<p>For [7], we think of Jesse Liptrap having atleast <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=jesse+liptrap&amp;btnG=">3 papers</a> on his
name</p>

<p>For ‚Äòit might be good to [1]‚Äô, we think of Jesse having finished his PhD
being able to work in Google (with the possibility of earning to give)
and in the end still able to come back to research.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: It is better to do [8] unless [9].</p>

<p><em>I guess the point of 80k is: To explore and try other things before
joining PhD, as once you finish your PhD and leave academia to
explore, coming back is hard. I was unable to find real life examples
of ‚Äúhow hard it is‚Äù or who these people were.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After your (PhD)[1], it‚Äôs hard to (re-enter academia if you leave)[2], so at
this stage if (you‚Äôre still in doubt)[3] it‚Äôs often best to (continue
within academia)[4] (although this is less true in (certain disciplines,
like machine learning, where much of the most cutting-edge research
is done in industry)[5]). Eventually, however, it may well be best to do
(research in non-profits, corporations, governments and think tanks
instead of academia)[6], since (this can sometimes let you focus more on
the most practically relevant issues and might suit you better)[7].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: After [1], its hard to [2]</p>

<p><em>Was not able to find an example online for someone who came back to
academia and how ‚Äúhard‚Äù it was for him</em></p>

<p><em>Skipped the whole para, it is taking a lot of time to find examples
(an hour or more)</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: if [3], better to [4]</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: if [3], better to [4], unless [5].</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: It is better to work in [6], since [7]</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: it is better to work in [6].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can also (support the work of other researchers)[1] in a
(complementary role, such as a project manager, executive assistant,
fundraiser or operations)[2]. We‚Äôve argued (these roles)[3] are often
neglected, and therefore especially high-impact. It‚Äôs often useful
to have (graduate training in the relevant area)[4] before taking these
roles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: It is good to [1] in [2].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: As discussed earlier, AI safety is really quite neglected
with 100 people working on it with 10m <span>$</span>. Neil Bowerman
from 80khours is trying to add people required to fill the ‚Äútalent
gaps‚Äù. If Neil is able to add 10 more people and even claim 1% of
their total impact that would be 570 lives saved just for his work in
a few years. Contrast that to a DS job which saves 400 people</p>

<p><em>I think it is important to contrast it with something otherwise it is
hard for someone to understand if it is good or bad. Agree: to always
contrast?</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [3] is often neglected</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: As of 2017 only 100 people are working. Adding another
hundred people would reduce the risk by only 1%. The risk associated is
a 5% chance of world extinction by 2100.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [3] is high impact</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: As shown above 1 extra person in the field of AI can on
average save 57k people. If Neil is able to add 10 more people and
even claim 1% of their total impact that would be 570 lives saved
just for his work in a few years.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [3] is neglected and hence it is high impact.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: AI is neglected whereas Climate Change is not. A person
working in AI seems to have 1000 times more impact than a person
working for Climate Change.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: There is no doubting [1].</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Why is there no doubting [1]?</p>

<p><strong>Split</strong>: For [1], we think of, 5% chance for human extinction due to
AI by 2100.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The fate of Gorillas currently depends on the actions of
humans. Similarly the fate of humanity may come to depend more on the
actions of machines than our own.</p>

<p><em>This is reasoning and not an example I think, your thoughts? or I
should just give a hypothetical example?</em></p>

<p>Imagine Russia has an autonomous weapon system, that works without
human intervention. If the weapon detects a threat it is going to
engage and bomb the hell out of who ever it thinks did this. If the AI
makes a mistake at any time, it still continues to bomb the hell out
of who ever it thinks did it, resulting in war.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Problem is [2].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: MIRI was founded in 2000. And in 2017 80khours says that
adding another 100 people will only solve 1% of the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [3] is at stake.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>The fate of Gorillas currently depends on the actions of humans. They
are currently endangered. Similarly the fate of humanity may come to
depend on the actions of machines than our own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Around 1800, (civilization)[4] underwent (one of the most profound shifts

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Around 1800, [4], underwent [5].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Around 1800, inventions such as the steam engine fueled
transportation using horses or a boat went on to railroads, steam
boats and automobiles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(This)[6] wasn‚Äôt the (first such event)[7] ‚Äì (the agricultural

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [6] wasn‚Äôt [7].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The agricultural revolution 12000 years earlier, allowed
humans to produce enough food for themselves. This shows up only in the
1700s with the population rise from 5.5m to 9 million in Britain. It
does not show up earlier due to diseases ad warfare apparently.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(A growing number of experts)[8] believe that (a third revolution will

(Stephen Hawking to Stuart Russell, the author of the best-selling AI
textbook, AI: A Modern Approach)[10].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [8] believe [9].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Stephen Hawking says here that ‚Äúfull development of an

<p><em>i guess this is not an example!</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [10] are part of [8].</p>

<p>AlphaGo, identified superior ways of playing GO which were previously

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [8] is [9].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Humans are capable of making tools like spheres to be

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [3] might be [4] either going into [5] or [6].</p>

<p><strong>Split</strong>:</p>

<p>For [3], we think of a world where machines are more intelligent than
human beings.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>There is a chance that we could go into extinction (for example, as a
result of autonomous warbots being compromised leading into war) and
if not it could be curing diseases/problems like Cancer or global
warming. The outcomes are on both extremes.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: AI safety is [7].</p>

organization working on curing Malaria: AMF for this year got 40m

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [8] is spent on [8a]</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: It appears that billions of dollars are going to be spent
on making virtual assistants, chatbots, recognize images, process
human speech, identify anomalies in CT scans, identify cracks in jet

global poverty since 2011, but regarding AI articles are made only
since 2017 despite encountering it in 2009.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: 80khours didn‚Äôt bother to publish an article until 2017
from 2009 to 2017 on AI safety</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Many others understood the risks by [8].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>I have seen the TED talk before in 2017 December, only now am I truly
warming up to AI safety (possibly because I made the world class
assumption that all EAO‚Äôs have exactly the same impact as GiveWell). I
never really saw the need to give money to MIRI until a week
back. Recently I started off with the ‚Äúkey ideas post‚Äù by 80khours and
started taking apart the phrases when I realized the impact (57k
people per extra person working on it). Additionally it helped to see
several scientists giving a voice for AI safety
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311011724/https://futureoflife.org/ai-open-letter">here</a>. Furthermore, it helped to make concrete the risks such as
with the autonomous weapons potential to destabilize nations.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [9] can be [10].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035381">Here</a>, UN has requested a ban on development of
autonomous weapons. If all countries come to an agreement on this, it
could potentially save us from extinction as a result of autonomous
weapons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Working on a newly recognized problem)[1] means that (you risk throwing

but (it)[] also means that you may have a (bigger impact by pioneering an
area others have yet to properly appreciate)[4], just like (many of the
highest impact people in history have done)[5].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [1] means [2].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: ‚ÄúEarlier this year, the U.S. defense think-tank Rand

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>I am not sure what they are getting at, they are
basically suggesting all possible scenarios aka, you will see AI
materialize or you wont see it materialize! Sounds useless to me.</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: You may have [4].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: There are only 100 people working in AI safety with a
calculated 57k people to be saved if one additional person works on
it, on average.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: you may have [4], just like [5].</p>

<p><strong>Split</strong>:</p>

<p>For [4], we think of working in AI safety and saving 57k people.</p>

pioneering in the are of Non-violence, which others were yet to

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Talent is inborn due to 2.</p>

<p><em>because</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: 21 is [3].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>‚ÄúGeorge Grove, the founding editor of ‚ÄúGrove‚Äôs Dictionary of Music and
Musicians‚Äù has called Mendelssohn‚Äôs ‚ÄúMidsummer Night‚Äôs Dream‚Äù
overture, Op. 21 ‚Äúthe greatest marvel of early maturity that the world
has ever seen in music.‚Äù This work was completed by Mendelssohn on
August 6, 1826 when Mendelssohn was 17 years and 6 months old.‚Äù‚Äî<a href="http://themusicalvoice.net/?p=408">Source</a></p>

training at the age of three.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [10] has high influence on Greatness/Success</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>‚ÄúA study with highly skilled chess players and non-experts in chess was
done where all were shown real chess game positions of 25 pieces for
5-10 seconds. The chess masters were able to recall the position of
every single piece, whereas the non-experts were able to recall 4 or 5
pieces. As expected. This was followed up with random placement of
chess pieces and the same 5-10 seconds to remember each piece. The
chess masters and the non-experts pretty much ended up with the same
results.‚Äù‚Äî <a href="/deliberate-practice.html">from Agent18‚Äôs blog</a></p>

individuals)[16]. Because of such a large number the (endless
sources of noise)[17] are expected to be drowned. (The bosses)[18]
gave (good indication of the IQ of the person with their

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [12] are [13].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: As a Design Engineer the contribution in terms of numbers
(<span>$</span> contributed to my company) is highly unclear. I guess
as a result we have vague criteria for determining our impact such as
‚Äúhow I did my work in a year rated from 1-3‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat I did rated
from 1-3‚Äù. One day I work on a verification procedure, another day I
work on some stage design which takes 2 years to make, whose value is
not yet known. Where as in Sales, its OK/NOK. You either sold 5 bulbs
or you didn‚Äôt.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [12] are [13] as it is clear to measure [14].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: You either sold 5 bulbs or you didn‚Äôt.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [14a] implies [14b]</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: If you sold ‚Äòn‚Äô tables for X <span>$</span>. If you sold
‚Äò2n‚Äô tables then you make 2X <span>$</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [15] was the largest of its kind</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: There are other papers with sample sizes ranging from
11 to 16k. This study had almost 46k large sample. (It was actually a
combination of several samples from different papers.)</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [15] contained [16].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: [15] contained samples from studies with sample sizes
from 11 to 16k.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: With 45k samples, [17] is expected to be drowned</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>This is a hard one, need to spend a lot of time on
understanding randomness and come up with examples! Skip for now! I
have no idea of examples for 17 in the context of the sales people,
nor do I know why it is drowned or have an example for it.</em></p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: [18] have [19].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The bosses rated their staff on their performance and it
turns out that they have 0.4 correlation with IQ. The bosses ratings

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>AlphaGo, identified superior ways of playing GO which were previously
considered rubbish by humans for thousands of years. Computers seem
like they can go beyond what humans can see with years and years of
work, within just a year. Similarly, it could be possible to cure
cancer and other diseases.</p>

<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>

<p>I am currently in India on vacation. Trying to clock 6 hrs per day.</p>

<p><strong>Day 1 to 5:</strong> 6 hrs each (only DP)</p>

<p><strong>Day 6:</strong> 6-7 hrs (DP correction and editing)</p>

<p><strong>Total time:</strong> 36 hrs 200 phrases and ~ 110 claims</p>

<p><strong>DP stats</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Key ideas (74 phrases 42 claims 15 hrs)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AI (45 phrases ~21 claims 6 hrs)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TOI (80 phrases 54 claims 9 hrs)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DP Correction</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>key ideas (0.5/min)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AI (1/min)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TOI (1.33/min)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>P.S to self</strong></p>

<p>Lot of procrastination especially on the last day. It‚Äôs 3 am and I
still ain‚Äôt done, luckily the DP correction got over smooth and
fast. Every day I sleep late and wake up later and start later. First
day I started at 9 and within day 6 (today), I stared at 2. Something
or the other came up.</p>

<p>Biggest source of distraction: Big ass tv with great movies. Movies
shoudl be used only as a treat.</p>
