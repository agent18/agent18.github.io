<p>Friends after masters earn from 85k to 130k cash as beginners I think
based on location.</p>

<p>I suspect the money aspect is pretty standard within Holland, ~40k for
beginner and 45k for bigger companies, for master graduates. Anyways, I am not interested in
getting money right now, just need to survive. If the experience is
crazy, if there are crazy learning’s, and if it is possible to achieve a
lot within the company, that would still work for me, it appears.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By country, the US has the highest median salaries ($117k), followed
by Canada ($95k), Australia/New Zealand ($90k), and UK and Ireland
($82k).-<a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/#direct-impact-potential">80k hrs profile on DS</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>McKinsey Global Institute has predicted that by 2018 the U.S. could
face a shortage of between 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep
analytical skills, and a shortage of 1.5 million managers and
analysts who know how to leverage data analysis to make effective
decisions.-<a href="https://blog.udacity.com/2014/11/data-analysts-what-youll-make.html">UDEMY</a></p>

<p>If I choose this career, I better be able to change the lives of
1000’s of people with this science, or I better be able to give
at least 50k$ within the next 5 years, that is with the understanding I
would make at least 150k $ cash!</p>

<h2 id="ways-in-which-i-can-migrate-to-the-us">Ways in which I can migrate to the US</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Do a 1.5 year masters in US</p>

    <p>The cons being:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>money for tuition and living (can’t expect scholarship having
done nothing to become better) is  a problem</li>
      <li>It will take at least 2019 august before I start</li>
      <li>If I don’t find a job, I don’t know what happens</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do DS for a few years and become very good and apply at the US
directly</p>

    <p>The cons being:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not sure of the shot to the US</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Join Google or other big companies within Europe and then move to
the US with an L1</p>

    <p>The cons being:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not sure of how much to rely on this</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-to-start">how to start</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>1.5 year master anywhere (US preferably)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 months prep at home/ join a course</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>join a traineeship in Netherlands / join as a starter</p>

    <p>I could work in ASML, in DS, there are a couple of traineeships being
 offered around the country. Airlines seem to be interested in data
 centric roles for generic engineers. A dutch friend of mine from the
 same master as me got an offer from KLM for a DS job involving some
 engineering.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><del>5. somehow use your experience until now and combine that with DS</del></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If I do a serious course in US/London, maybe I can apply directly
to the US.</p>

    <p>Investigate this about internationals in 2 bootcamps in US and London</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="mid-way">Mid-way</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Look at place like Center for Disease Control, Google, Khan Academy, Bayes Impact and DataKind</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Become a product leader and grow up the ladder and just earn-to-give</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="main-points-for-choosing-this-career">Main points for choosing this career?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I personally know a couple of people who went to this field straight
from a master within my university.</li>
  <li>I see a nice personal fit with programming (python) and problem-solving</li>
  <li>Suggested by 80k hours</li>
  <li>Friends in this Apple field earn &gt;130k as a starting option</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does--matter">What does  matter?</h2>

<p>When, I get my Citizenship within Holland, matters. I think it is much
a safe buffer I would like to have before. I am not sure what I can do
when I go back to India, my earning potential, my impact potential
etc…, leave quality of life and all that shit.</p>

<p>Also, I just have a few more years to clock here before I get
citizenship, I might as well get it and then leave or attempt other
things.</p>
