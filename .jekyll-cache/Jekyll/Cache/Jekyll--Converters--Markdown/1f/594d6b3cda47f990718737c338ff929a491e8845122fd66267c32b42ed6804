  <p>What is flow? It is what we feel when we are fully alive. When we are involved with what we do, and in harmony with the environment around us. It is something that happens most easily. When we sing, dance, do sports - but it can happen when we work, read a good book or have a good conversation</p>

<p>I am really feeling de-motivated on seeing an injury. Random places hurt. For example, sometimes when I do lunges, my toes hurt. Last week somehow I have a stiff muscle in the back and didn’t go to the gym on monday.</p>

<p>I suspect the problem is not about feeling sad because I couldn’t feel the pump. I think it is because people know that I work out. I suspect that if I don’t lift weight s the case is the same, what is maciej going to say about me. Fuck the people pandian. They insult me big time. SO WHAT?</p>

<p>If you feel pain, take a break. Dont feel the need to rush and injure yourself. Do it cause it’s its own end. Don’t treat it like a means to something. you wan’t to do it over a long time. Grow up pandian. It’s okay if you are not so strong when you go to india. You don’t care about what people think. All you care about is how to increase the membership fees in the long run.</p>

<p>Period.</p>

<p>thats great think about the times you have no pain. for example today, how I was before and after going to the gym, was it just a pain to stop me from doing what I love doing.. Is what I love doing somehow causing me stress?</p>

<h4 id="cardio">Cardio</h4>

<p>As I said last week, I am unable to reliably, know what is the right goal. I am afraid of being dissapointed. I make up goals now and then.</p>

<p>But then last saturday, I did a long bike ride for 40 mins. I will say I had quite some fun. It was a new route, there was so many nice things to watch, I was able to go fast, the weather was nice. All along I was looking at my speedo meter, and I guess I was partially looking at it for motivation.</p>

<p>My hypothesis somehow is that, maybe I need to go longer? I worry it absolutely doenst make sense. The motivation equation is simple, feedback, challenge skill balance and immediate feedback. here is the thing, I can run experimnets, but I fucking don’t know what the fuck to measure, get it? For everything I have an excuse. Don’t you know when you are in flow, like when you are playing basketball? YES. I guess then, I am not in flow. Cardio is between being a chore and feeling awesome. It’s here and there.</p>

<p>So I looked at the avg thingy, I notice that even that is rigged. In the beginning I am not able to get the averages to the right value</p>

<p>Changing route to a more flat setting!</p>

<p>right not I don’t even thing of it as chore, in the sense that to me it a normal thing to do after I work out or at the end of the day. No bigge! Just like brushing my teeth and flossing?</p>

<p>But how did you come up with the hypothesis. I think I am over challenging myself. Hmmm but shouldn’t you feel anxiety. I guess I do, sometimes not being able to push as necessary.
