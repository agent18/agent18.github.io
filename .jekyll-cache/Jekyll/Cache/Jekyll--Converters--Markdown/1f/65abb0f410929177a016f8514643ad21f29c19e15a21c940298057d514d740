<blockquote>
  <p>A woman who pays her own bills, buys her own things, and does not allow a man to affect her stability or self-confidence. She supports herself entirely on her own and is proud to be able to do so.  <br />
-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_woman">wiki</a></p>

<p>A woman who earns as much as the man or more, who doesn’t depend on a man for economic security, I feel is all the more going to be a bigger bitch. She needs you for one thing less. She has more Power. The data is not abundant on this. I guess we only have my opinion for this.</p>

<p>Looking at my parents, looking at all my female cousins and their respective male counter parts, looking at the people I know in chennai, looking at the people I know in Holland, considering the market in India on marriage websites, I am going to for now assume that these women are less in number. P(of getting married to such a women) = 30%, lets say.</p>

<h4 id="divorce">Divorce</h4>

<p>Divorce rates in India are super low. Not because marriage is blissful. My parents, god knows why they are together. My mom always complains. My dad gets angry for silly ass things and yet she stays with him. I am almost positive they have not had sex in a long long time. My moms sister is worse. Her husband is a dick. A big dick! He doesn’t provide for the family. Brought the family into heavy debt. And yet she only stops at complaining, never has thought about divorce. All the maids I know have abusive husbands. Divorce? Was is das! I would attribute it to the taboos mainly. My friends mother, who is as independent a woman can get, tells me that her husband has an affair and that he will not give divorce. And she just accepted that. They lived separated for a while but then now he is back at home. My point being divorce rates are not a good indication of happy marriages, atleast in India.</p>

<p>If you look at countries like Netherlands, US and the like, we can see that those taboos don’t exist here. Women are proper bitches, and are ready to say good bye to you when they want to. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_demography">~50% divorce rate</a> in these countries. Imagine, there is a 50% chance that you are going to loose half your money.</p>

<h4 id="kids">Kids</h4>

<p>In the thread <a href="https://dontmarry.wordpress.com/">“Dont marry”</a> I see that not many complain about kids, while they are primarily focusing on how marriage sucks because of the woman. People go to the extent of saying, that if it weren’t for the kids, they would have gotten out of the relationship long back. There are many comments and that makes the difference for me.</p>

<p>My idea of kids are that they are pain, cost us a lot of money for education and survival. You can try as much as you wan’t but they are going to be what they are going to be when they leave the house. They are probably going to smoke, burn your money, be irrational, be tramps, be complete dicks in the house, fight with their siblings etc… The only thing I would hate is when it is so painful to just simply raise them. I have seen my nieces, nephews in the younger ages, so fucking painful they were to their parents. Always needing attention and causing silly problems. Kids need a lot of attention, and sacrifice. There is only so much you can do to raise a child with sense so that he is not swayed by stupid consumerist stuff. If its a girl, I am afraid that it’s all the more hard to get your rational point across. I don’t have numbers, I don’t have data. Not one person complained about kids during his marriage in <a href="https://dontmarry.wordpress.com/">“Dont marry”</a>.</p>

<p>Why have kids?  From the thread <a href="https://dontmarry.wordpress.com/">“Dont marry”</a>, I gather that people love their kids, for some reason. Seemingly it informs me that kids might not be a bad idea, considering them just exclusively possible, say without a marriage.</p>

<h4 id="no-cheating-no-variety-no-masturbation">No cheating, no variety, no masturbation</h4>
<p>You cannot cheat, when stuck with a bored wife and have no variety. You got to stay in script while having sex? deal with it. 
From the same thread I get the idea that masturbation is viewed with contempt. Thats just great.</p>

<h1 id="open-issue">Open Issue</h1>
<p>Why does my brother and all my cousins and parents think they should marry and go on to say that I should marry? odd!</p>

<p>People who marry look so happy outside! But they look so happy outside? Probability</p>
