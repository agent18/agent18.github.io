<h4 id="availabilty">Availabilty</h4>

<p>Availbility hueristic is one way in which we <em>humans universally operate</em>. We tend to judge the probability of an event, based on which examples of the event come to mind.</p>

<p>A study by Lichtenstein et al. in 1978, that judged the â€˜frequency of lethal eventsâ€™, informed that subjects thought accidents to be more frequent than disease; and suicide to be more frequent than homicide. This judgement was quite wrong as the actual data suggested that diseases killed <strong>16 times</strong> more than accidents; And homicides two times more than suicides.</p>

<p>Our judgement in determining the frequency of future events sucks. Got it! Obvious hypotheses could be that suicides and accidents are more dramatic, that we tend to remember them well; or that they get featured in the tabloids and the media much more often, resulting in selective availability.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1979, a followup study by Combs and Slovic showed that the skewed probability judgements correlated strongly (.85 and .89) with skewed reporting frequencies in two newspapers. This doesnâ€™t disentangle whether murders are more available to memory because they are more reported-on, or whether newspapers report more on murders because murders are more vivid (hence also more remembered).  But either way, an availability bias is at work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that in order to conclude that â€˜newspapers report more on murders because murders are more vividâ€™, we need more information. However, regarding whether murders are more available to memory because they are more reported-on, seems slightly tricky as I find myself spending quite some time on it, without fruit. I currently donâ€™t see the difference between the â€˜followup study by Combs and Slovicâ€™ while comparing it to the statement made immediately after.</p>

<h4 id="investigation-into-the-not-clear">Investigation into the not-clear</h4>

<p>Probability judgements are strongly correlated to reporting frequencies. I believe Eleizer added â€˜skewedâ€™ to inform that our judgments are wrong af! but why did he add â€˜skewedâ€™ to the reporting? Probably because reporters were assumed to be selectively reporting, which is not â€˜Truthâ€™, hence skewed. Probability judgements(sentence 1) I assume are a result of availability(sentence 2), i.e. information available to memory allowing us to make guesses. Reporting frequencies(sentence 1) seem to be the same as referring to more reported-on. And Sentence 1 and 2 seem to be practically the same.</p>

<p>Here are my following hypothesis where the error might be in my understanding:</p>

<p>First hypothesis is that the assumption â€˜Probability judgements(sentence 1) I assume are a result of availability(sentence 2)â€™ is wrong. Second is based on the fact that they use the term â€˜moreâ€™; That Eleizer is questioning if more reports =&gt; more availability to the memory. Third- Correctional data might not actually mean anything, as evidenced in sentence 2.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 1 seems not so probable. More reports neednâ€™t mean more availability to the memory; for example, reports might not be proportional to availability, that is to say that it could be an exponential or an x^2 graph; But as I try to explain what the other examples could be to support hypothesis 2, I am unable to come up with anything. Thats where my doubts regarding this hypothesis still continue to stay. And the more I look at it, the more it seems to me that I might be wrong. Looking at the data (Sentence 1), doesnâ€™t it already say that more availability was based on more frequency?</p>

<p>I will investigate correlation and causality tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bis bald!</p>
