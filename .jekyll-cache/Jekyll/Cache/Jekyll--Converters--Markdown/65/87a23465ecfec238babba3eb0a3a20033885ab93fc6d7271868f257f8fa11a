<p>Until now I have been desparately trying to look at biases to get some clue on what they are actually meant for. I had a look at the wikipedia page on hueristics, and unfortunately I was not able to get any information on what the biases are actually meant for, my goal being to ascertain the true value system. Maybe the places I am looking are not the right places. I tried going through help results for “morality and hueristics” as well. Anyways I am still stuck with the question of what is my true value system.</p>
