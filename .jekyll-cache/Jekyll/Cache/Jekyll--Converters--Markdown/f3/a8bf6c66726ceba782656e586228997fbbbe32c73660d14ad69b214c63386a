<h3 id="ea-orgs-hiring">EA orgs hiring</h3>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: EA orgs don‚Äôt seem to be able to hire the number of
<em>Entrepreneurs</em> they set out to hire, at the end of a hiring round.</p>

<p><strong>Re-write claim</strong>: The number of people who were accepted at the end
of the year for Entrepreneurs, is less than the number of
incubees budgeted for at the beginning of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: The Number of people who were ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù by the end of
the year for entrepreneurs,</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: is lesser than to the number of incubees
budgeted for at the beginning of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Example-sub</strong>: <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship">17 people</a> accepted</p>

<p><strong>Example-pred</strong>: 10 people budgeted for ‚Äúinitially‚Äù.</p>

<p>Note: It is hardly possible to see from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pVLfqvE8cIQDcRKHN4L_YnFbOilLQG-dC5DtNWvLUxw/edit#gid=0">budget</a> how many
people they budgeted for. But the CEO informs via mail that it was 10
‚Äúinitially‚Äù for the year 2019.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very start, we budgeted for 10 but moved it up to 12 after
getting a better sense of applications eventually having in 13 in
the program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: False.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist</strong>: sub; Yes; pre; yes; ecm; Yes; s-1;</p>

<p><strong>Note/Rant</strong>: Budgets are hard to find (let alone read). CE‚Äôs budget
was hidden in a blog post which I got a hold of only after reaching
out to them. :(</p>

<p>Hmm. I didn‚Äôt really expect the claim to be false based on what was
said initially. In the last essay I literally said that: ‚ÄúEA orgs
<em>don‚Äôt</em> seem to be able to hire the number of <em>Entrepreneurs</em> they
want, <em>at the end of a hiring round</em>.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last year we were not management, mentoring or funding constraint
and would have let in more people if we thought more people could
found an extremely impactful charity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But looking at the re-written claim this is not true. The contrast is
baffling. I thought they meant one thing but I ended up with the
opposite. Dang it! English-1 Agent-0.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>EA orgs don‚Äôt seem to be able to hire the number of <em>Researchers</em>
they set out to, at the end of a hiring round.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: EA Orgs are not able to find the people they want while
hiring Researchers.</p>

<p><strong>re-write Claim</strong>: The number of people who were hired at EA Orgs in
Research is less than their goal for that year.</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: The number of people who were hired at EA Orgs in
Research,</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: is less than their goal for that year.</p>

<p><strong>Example-sub</strong>: In 2019 <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/">7 joined GiveWell‚Äôs research team</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Example-pred</strong>: They wanted to have <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity">3-5 signed offer letters</a> from new
research staff as per their goals explicitly stated in their blog.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: 7 !&lt; 5. Hence false claim.</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong>: Getting info from GiveWell‚Äôs budget was the hard part.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: EA Orgs don‚Äôt seem to be able to hire the number of people
they want while hiring for operations.</p>

<p><strong>re-write Claim</strong>: The number of people who were hired at EA orgs in
Operations is less than their goal for that year.</p>

<p><strong>Example-sub</strong>: In 2019 <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/">3 people joined the operations team of
GiveWell</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Example-pred</strong>: In 2019 GiveWell wanted <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity">to hire 1 operations associate</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: 3 !&lt; 1. False.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist</strong>: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes;</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: So far we checked GiveWell and Charity Entrepreneurship and
find that their goals (based on budget or explicit statements in the
blogpost) are ‚Äúmore than met‚Äù by the supply.</p>

to have left during that time and Nate Soares seems to have taken the

<p>According to MIRI, they were up by <a href="https://intelligence.org/2019/12/02/miris-2019-fundraiser/">8 research staff as of
2019</a>. It appears MIRI was looking at net population of staff, when

<h2 id="randomista-development">Randomista development</h2>

<p><strong>Based on</strong>: <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bsE5t6qhGC65fEpzN/growth-and-the-case-against-randomista-development">Highest Karma EA forum post</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We define randomista development (RD) as an approach to development
economics which investigates, evaluates and recommends only
interventions which can be tested by randomized controlled trials
(RCTs).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>RD can take low-risk or more ‚Äúhits-based‚Äù forms. Effective altruists
have especially focused on the low-risk form of RD: specifically,
directly funding interventions that have been tested by RCTs, such
as malaria bednet distributions and cash transfers. However, even
within direct funding of such programmes, there is significant
variation in the probability of success. For example, GiveWell
thinks that deworming is a high risk/high-reward bet with a
significant chance of having small effect but some chance of having
a large effect. Other GiveWell recommended programmes offer a much
more certain probability of impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: There is some fundamental confusion regarding the definition
of ‚ÄúRD‚Äù. ‚ÄúRD is defined as an approach to development economics which
investigates, evaluates and recommends only interventions which ‚Äúcan
be tested‚Äù by randomized controlled trials (RCTs)‚Äù. If you say ‚ÄúCAN be
tested‚Äù then I don‚Äôt know how to go about testing it. I don‚Äôt know
what distinguishes something as ‚Äúcan be tested by RD‚Äù and ‚Äúcannot
be‚Ä¶‚Äù. If you say ‚ÄúIs tested by RCTs‚Äù instead, then both GiveWell and
OPP don‚Äôt qualify as ‚ÄúRD‚Äù, as some of the interventions that they
offer grants to, do not have RCTs for them e.g., <a href="https://www.givewell.org/research/incubation-grants/centre-pesticide-suicide-prevention/august-2017-grant">‚ÄúCPSP‚Äù</a>. Having
said that, the author of the blog post refers to GiveWell and Open
Philanthropy Project (OPP) in the context of ‚ÄúRD‚Äù multiple times, so in
many places I just substitute ‚ÄúRD‚Äù with GiveWell or OPP.</p>

<p>So basically the claim is modified as shown: ‚ÄúDirect funding of
interventions that <del>can be</del> <em>have been tested</em> by RCTs.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Direct funding of interventions that have been tested by
RCTs can be low-risk.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: RD can take ‚Äúlow-risk forms‚Äù.</p>

<p><strong>re-write Claim</strong>: Recommending interventions which are based on RCTs,

accounting for the mismatch between RCTs and current interventions).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recently, GiveWell announced that they will expand their research
beyond RD to include difficult-to-evaluate interventions. This could
include economic growth, though their initial focus is on improving
health policy. Nonetheless, as things stand at the moment, most of the
EA money in global development focuses on directly funding
interventions that can be tested by RCTs. Almost all EAs interested in
global development we have met at events like EAG seem focused on
directly funding, or working for, organizations implementing
interventions that can be tested by RCTs.</p>

research beyond RD to include difficult-to-evaluate interventions.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: GiveWell says they are going to go ‚Äúbeyond empirical

reviewing direct interventions in sectors where impacts are more
difficult to measure, investigating opportunities to influence
government policy, as well as other areas.‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think there is
any point in going further than this ATM as this is about their future
and it‚Äôs only been 6 months. Are they talking about even smaller
‚Äúadjustment factors‚Äù (as seen in the beginning)? That would be one of
the ways how we can measure if the organizations are

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: GiveWell‚Äôs initial focus is to focus on improving public

show that research and advocacy for growth is better than randomista

  <p>This does not mean that GDP is all that matters. The metric of GDP
per capita misses some crucial contributors to human welfare,

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Public goods: Increasing income per head reliably increases
consumption of private goods. However, it might not necessarily
increase public goods, such as public health interventions, clean
air, public safety, electricity grids, sanitation, and so on.</p>

  <p>Inequality: Individuals get diminishing marginal utility from
income, so income gains to the better-off should be valued less than
income gains to the worse-off. Thus, holding income per capita and
everything else equal, societies with a more equal income
distribution must have greater welfare per person. In addition,
income and other resources might be positional goods - perceiving
others to be richer might be another mechanism by which inequality
might lead to lower overall welfare. This is a difference in welfare

  <p>Crucially, on the Jones and Klenow welfare metric, most developing
countries are substantially poorer than incomes suggest because of a
combination of shorter lives and extreme inequality. Lower life
expectancy reduces welfare by 15 to 50 percent in the developing
countries Jones and Klenow examine, which implies that global welfare
inequality is greater than global income inequality.[11] Therefore,
ensuring evenly shared growth and improved health is also important
for human welfare. We do not investigate the best way to do that here,
though we think that these goals are best advanced outside of the
constraints of directly funding RCT-backed interventions.</p>

<p>Netherlands has unemployment benefits (a form of cash transfer by the
govt.) for the unemployed (for a certain period) where it pays 70% of
the salary (avg. salary=36.5k EUR). In 2018 there was an unemployment
rate of 3.5%. Assuming 1% of the unemployed got the benefits, this
amounts to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">17mx3.5%x70%x36.5kEURx1%</code>=200m USD.</p>

<p>Regarding Kenya, GiveDirectly managed to pump only <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/financials/">32m</a> in cash
transfers. This seems to be the only monetary aid they get. There seem

to their own hard work, even if NGOs did play a role. Secondly, the
impact of some NGOs may be difficult to see, even for
beneficiaries. For example, most people may not be able to notice the
substantial effect of salt iodisation or the Green Revolution on their

this survey does suggest that direct funding of RCT-backed

<p><strong>Note</strong>: We can only comment on what is observed. What is observed is
for a given median annual consumption the head count poverty rate
doesn‚Äôt vary too much (15% max). But this variation at a given
consumption is lower (around 3% max) for poverty rates in the order of
35 to 50%, which is where Give Directly does its cash transfers
intervention. So if we look at a median consumption around 750 units
in the same graph <a href="https://d101vc9winf8ln.cloudfront.net/documents/32264/original/RCTs_and_the_big_questions_10000words_june30.pdf?1565974982">Figure 3</a>, then we see &lt;5%.</p>

  <p>Number of ‚Äúgood quality‚Äù people ‚Ä¶  Looking at the acceptance rates
it appears that EA Orgs are hard to get in just like the top
Universities. I am unsure anything related to the number of ‚Äúgood
quality‚Äù people can be derived from here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Need to further break down ‚Äúnumber of ‚Äògood quality‚Äô people‚Äù. Are we
talking about (a) the number of people in the world with a certain
level of qualification (say, PhD in Economics and 2 years of work
experience), whether or not they work in one of the EA organizations,
(b) the number of people who applied for a particular job posting, or
(c) the number of people who were hired?</p>

<p>(What is this ‚Äúquality‚Äù you speak of?)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EA Orgs seem to think that there are more candidates fit for the job
than the ones they hired in research. OPP said they got more than
100s of good resumes for the GR positions. In the end they thought
multiple people from the pool who didn‚Äôt make it, would exceed at
OPP in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>EA orgs seem to think that there are NOT many candidates fit for the
job than the ones they hired in Entrepreneurship. CE had ~20
positions and were able to fill only 17 in 2019. But in 2020 with
more than 10 times the applications as in 2019, it is probable that
they have more ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù candidates than the people they hire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What they say and think about the number of candidates fit for the job
is different from the number of people hired or the other claims we
saw above. Stick to one claim at a time. See what happens when you
don‚Äôt try to test the claim ‚Äúholistically‚Äù.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Funding: Short on cash to hire people</p>

  <p>Meta Orgs don‚Äôt seem to be affected by funding while considering
hiring researchers. OPP said, ‚Äúour current ability to immediately
assess and deploy this base of available talent is weak‚Äù. It is not
clear if hiring is affected by funding in Longtermism Orgs. There is
not info I can find regarding this on MIRI for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>short on cash‚Äù? ‚Äúaffected by funding‚Äù? ‚Äúability to immediately deploy
available talent is weak‚Äù?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my dictionary is defective and seems to have omitted
those words, so I‚Äôm having a hard time following this.</p>

<p>How are you supposed to test the claim that someone is ‚Äúshort on
cash‚Äù? He didn‚Äôt hire a million people? Even Bill Gates didn‚Äôt hire a
million people.</p>

<p>Contrast that to: this year‚Äôs hiring budget. Even if that number is
not directly available, you could look at related numbers like last
year‚Äôs expenditure on salaries and other overhead, last year‚Äôs funds
raised, and thus whatever surplus amount they have for hiring this
year (this is one way people may decide their hiring budget; they may
also look at their projected funds raised this year, etc.). Example:
MIRI budget breakdown -
https://intelligence.org/2019/12/02/miris-2019-fundraiser/.</p>

<p>So, one way to look at claims of ‚Äúfunding-constrained‚Äù is to see the
growth in budget and check if there was a surplus compared to last
year and if more of that went into hiring new employees or if it went
into higher salaries for existing employees, administrative costs
(like managers or accountants), and higher rent for a bigger office.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? If someone‚Äôs projected budget is not higher than
last year‚Äôs, then he probably doesn‚Äôt have much budget for hiring new
employees. In that case, I would predict that donating more would
probably lead to more hires and thus hopefully more impact (SST). But
if his projected budget is higher and he still doesn‚Äôt allocate much
for new hires, then I wouldn‚Äôt expect to see more donations to lead to
more hires and more I-word. Much of that money might go into higher
salaries or a bigger office (which may or may not lead to less I-word
but will probably be different from that for new hires).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PH representing RP, RC, CS says,</p>

  <p>I personally feel much more funding constrained / management
capacity constrained / team culture ‚Äúdon‚Äôt grow too quickly‚Äù
constrained than I feel ‚ÄúI need more talented applicants‚Äù
constrained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WTF.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, orgs in GH&amp;P hiring for entrepreneurship don‚Äôt seem to be
short on cash. CE (via mail) says that, they were not having any
issues with money, but suggest that this year (2020) the situation
might be different due to the 10 times more applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚Äúissues with money‚Äù vs ‚Äúbudget for new hires‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you are a new or an old org you seem to want money to get
more hires. RP is a new org (founded in 2018) and would like money
to get more hires, but so does TLYCS (founded in 2010) and the whole
RC (2013) CS franchise according to Peter which were founded many
years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is answering a different kind of question from the question for
this section. This is about ‚Äúdoes the age of the organization affect
how much they ‚Äòseem to want money‚Äô?‚Äù But the question for this section
was ‚Äúare they ‚Äòshort on cash‚Äô?‚Äù #SeparateThyClaims</p>

<p>Lovely. Keep up the great work, Mr. Agent. 3.6 hours per day calls for

<p>Mission #7: Here‚Äôs your mission, should you choose to accept it - take
up some passage that has <strong>confused</strong> you (could be about work, politics,
EA, or AI), narrow down its claims, and test them with one concrete
example each. The <strong>output dimensions</strong> for each claim would be whether
you have a concrete example for the subject and the predicate and
whether the example actually talks about the same thing as the claim
(survey vs acceptance rate).</p>

<p>The twist is that you have to rewrite the sentence till the claims
without concrete examples are gone. For example, ‚Äúwe are short on
cash‚Äù will become ‚Äúwe have zero budget for new hires this year‚Äù plus
example.</p>

<h2 id="important-takeaways">Important takeaways</h2>

<p>So we have the <strong>claim</strong>, ‚ÄúGiveWell don‚Äôt seem to be affected by
funding while hiring researchers‚Äù. Let‚Äôs say it is expected to test
this against <strong>EE</strong> and not with statements such as: ‚ÄúOPP didn‚Äôt want
to hire in that round because of ‚Ä¶‚Äù. Then, I see the problem. I
can‚Äôt test the statement. SS Hurts.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs try another,</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: GiveWell ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want‚Äù to hire more researchers <del>not
because of funding issues</del> despite ‚Äúhaving enough funding‚Äù.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Even this is not good. SS is still hurting like hell ‚Äúdon‚Äôt
want to hire more researchers‚Äù, ‚Äúdespite having enough funding‚Äù.</p>

<p><strong>re-write Claim</strong>: GiveWell do not allocate more <del>funding</del> money in
budget than previous year for hiring, despite allocating ‚Äúmore‚Äù funds
to other things like bigger office, higher salaries etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This seems to be testable by checking budget as an STM has
informed. <em>Ufff! that took time to get to.</em></p>

<p><strong>re-write Claim</strong>: GiveWell does not allocate more money in budget

<p><strong>Lessons</strong>: Make claims testable by removing the fluff (‚Äúaffected by
funding‚Äù). Agent is struggling with complicated claims (‚Äúaffected by
funding‚Äù). As soon as you change that complicated part, you can modify
the claim to make it testable (as shown above).</p>

<h2 id="notes-to-an-stm">Notes to an STM</h2>

<p>I assumed we don‚Äôt talk about anything less than 200 claims. The above

    <p>Line donates the end of a ‚Äú<strong>Claim</strong>:‚Äù, not a ‚Äú<strong>re-write Claim</strong>:‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All ‚ÄúBecause‚Äù claims are skipped as that is not the goal
here. ‚ÄúBecause‚Äù is removed and the claim is treated regularly.</p>

    <p>For e.g.,</p>

    <p><strong>Claim</strong>: Most developing countries are substantially poorer than
incomes suggest because of a combination of shorter lives and extreme
inequality.</p>

    <p><strong>re-write Claim</strong>: Most developing countries are ‚Äúsubstantially
