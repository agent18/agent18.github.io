<p><strong>Requirements for Citizenship</strong></p>

<p>There are two options; One is called ‚ÄúOption‚Äù and the other is called
‚ÄúNaturalization‚Äù. ‚ÄúOption‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work for us, but ‚ÄúNaturalization
might just.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item">
    <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />You must be an adult (18 years and over).</p>
  </li>
  <li class="task-list-item">
    <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />You have either: <strong>lived in the Netherlands for an uninterrupted
    period of five years with a valid residence permit;</strong> been
    married to a Dutch national or lived with a Dutch national for
    three continuous years (including abroad); or you have resided
    in the Netherlands with a valid residence permit for a period
    of 10 years, with at least the last two years continuously.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not yet! I am down with 3.5/2.5/1.5 years. This number depends on a
few things. (TBD). What does uninterupted mean?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />You are <strong>sufficiently integrated</strong> in Dutch society and are able
    to read, write, speak and understand Dutch. You must prove
    this by taking a civic integration examination, and must pass
    the A2-level. If you have attained another diploma or degree
    (in Dutch) you can be eligible for an exemption.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the time I am up for this ‚Äúinterview‚Äù I should be sufficiently
integrated. Also they only need me to speak to A2 level, which I would
already be doing in a few more months.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />In the last four years you have not been subject to a
    custodial sentence, training order, community service order or
    large financial penalty (more than EUR 810).</li>
</ul>

<p>Should not be too hard!</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />You are prepared to renounce your current nationality. If you
    do not do this your Dutch citizenship may be withdrawn
    (although some exceptions exist for dual nationality).</li>
</ul>

<p>Last I checked, I know people who are in India, working, doing
everything like they are normal; people from US, people from
India. Why do I need an Indian Passport again. Even if I need to work
back in India! Get it? (TBd)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By renouncing your nationality you would lose certain rights, which
would cause you serious financial losses. This could include
consequences in terms of inheritance law. You must be able to
demonstrate this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(TBD before applying)</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />You have a valid permanent residence permit or a valid
    residence permit for a non-temporary purpose, for example,
    family reunification.</li>
</ul>

<p>I should have a valid residence permit. I already have until the year
of 2023 an RP. Of course, if I change job, I got to do it again.</p>

<p><strong>5 years to 7 years</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proposed changes to Dutch naturalisation laws Since 2013 the Dutch
government has been considering changing the Dutch Citizenship
Act. The amendments would extend the required residency period from
five to seven years before being able to apply for citizenship by
naturalisation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of December 2016, this amendment has not yet been approved and is
currently being debated in the Senate. Unconfirmed reports suggest it
may be introduced in April 2017.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>An interim law would apply to migrants already legally living in the
Netherlands for three years (uninterrupted) when the new law is
introduced. These people would still fall under the old requirement
term of five years to be eligible for naturalisation.</p>
