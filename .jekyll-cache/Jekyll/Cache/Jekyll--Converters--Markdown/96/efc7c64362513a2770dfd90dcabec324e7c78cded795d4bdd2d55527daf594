<p>In [yesterdays post] we saw the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>20% of a population of students have Diseasitis.
90% of those who have Diseasitis, turn a tongue depressor test black.
30% of those who do not have Diseasitis, turn the same tongue depressor test black.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turning black according to the test means that one has Diseasitis. The test is 90% of the time right for those that have Diseasitis. The test is 70% of the time right for those that do not have Diseasitis. This stems from the fact that 30% of the time the test wrongly predicts that people who do not have Diseasitis, have Diseasitis.</p>

<p>The question to really answer is that if the tongue-depressor-test is usually trust worthy. In other words, is the tongue-depressor-test, going to give me the right results &gt;50% of the time I use it.</p>

<p>Great. We would think it right to say that atleast 70% of the time the tongue-depressor-test gets things right as seen with the 90% and 70%.</p>

<p>But yesterday, we saw that out of the people who take the tongue-depressor-test and got it black, only 43% would actually have Diseasitis. That is to say that we were initially wrong when we said atleast 70% of the time the tongue-depressor gets things right.</p>

<p>Initially before the test, a nurse assumes that there is a 20% chance that a general population of students have Diseasitis. With the tongue-depressor-test showing black, the probability of someone being sick is 43%, i.e, higher. The test is useful in the fact that it is better than no test, but itâ€™s still not good enough, rather itâ€™s not conclusive enough.</p>

<h4 id="follow-up-question">Follow-up question</h4>

<p>Our ultimate interest is in Diseasitis, and people having them. So we explore some more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whatâ€™s the probability that a student who does not turn the tongue depressor black - a student with a negative test result - has Diseasitis?</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ N_D = 20
$ N_dnD = 80
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among patients who have Diseasitis, 10% do not turn the tongue depressor black - negative test result.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ N_D_dnB = 10% of N_D = 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>It also gives negative results (does not turn black) 70% of the time for healthy students.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ N_dnD_dnB = 70% of N_dnD = 0.7*80 = 56
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The probability that a student who does not turn the tongue depressor black and has Diseasitis:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ N_D_dnB / (N_D_dnB + N_dnD_dnB) = 2/58 = 3.5%
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It appears to me that these are the two numbers we need to see, when someone claims a test can predict:</p>

<p>1) The probability that a student who does not turn the tongue depressor black and has Diseasitis: 3.5 %</p>

<p>2) The probability that a student who turns the tongue depressor black and has Diseasitis: 43%</p>

<p>Awesome. Next!</p>
