<p>Mr. Agent,</p>

<p>Good job on continuously doing the exercise for 5+ hours every day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are (many issues)[1] we havenâ€™t been able to look into yet, so
we expect there are other (high-impact areas we havenâ€™t listed)[3].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What made them expect that there are other areas left? If I donâ€™t like
plain Parle G biscuits even after trying many times, I wonâ€™t say that
â€œI expect there are other tasty, plain Parle G biscuits that we
havenâ€™t listedâ€.</p>

<p>Perhaps theyâ€™ve seen an average of 3 out of 10 areas to be promising,
so based on that they expect that maybe 3 out of the remaining 10
would also be good. Or maybe not 3, but at least 1 or 2.</p>

<p>If they had tried a hundred areas and found zero promising ones, they
would not expect too many promising areas in the future.</p>

<p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>Reply</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong>***</p>

<p>Great! Didnâ€™t think of it like this! I tried to look for evidence
related to the hypothetical example you gave, but didnâ€™t find info on
how many issues they looked into. Could I have done better?</p>

<p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**End</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><em>**</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(These areas)[6a] can be (particularly worth pursuing)[7] if youâ€™re
(especially motivated by one of them)[8].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For [6a] we think of, working in promoting EA as in the above
example.</p>

  <p>For [8], we think of a personal fit of more than 50%</p>

  <p>For [7], we think of an impact of 5300*50%=2650 lives which is
better than working a DS job resulting in 530 net people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that doesnâ€™t use [8] at all. Why is it <strong>particularly</strong> worth
pursuing if you are â€œespecially motivatedâ€? The â€œimpactâ€ [7] you
pointed out would seem to be the same if you had [8] or if you didnâ€™t.</p>

<p>I would expect an example where someone who had this magical [8] went
on to have particularly great â€œimpactâ€. And I suspect that they do not
have that example.</p>

<p>Consider this: You can bowl a particularly high bouncer if youâ€™re 6
feet tall. Showing Bhuvaneshwar Kumar bowling a bouncer is not an
example. You have to show Courtney Walsh bowling a bouncer that is one
foot higher than usual bouncers.</p>

<p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>Reply</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong>***</p>

<p>OK! So it seems that I have missed the comparison of [8] vs not
[8]. i.e., what happens when AI safety is not motivating or less
motivating.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The (most effective careers)[1] are those that address the (most
pressing bottlenecks to progress)[2] on (the most pressing global
problems)[3].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word â€œmostâ€ should trigger your spider sense. If you recall our
past discussions, you can say â€œmostâ€ only when youâ€™ve actually
compared against everybody else in the set and found it to have the
highest value.</p>

<p>This sentence uses â€œmostâ€ thrice. They may be right about what theyâ€™re
saying, but can you verify it? For [3], have you compared global
problems to see which one is most â€œpressingâ€ (A)? For [2], have you
compared the bottlenecks to progress in that field and found the one
that is most â€œpressingâ€ (B)? Finally, for [1], have you compared the
â€œeffectivenessâ€ of different careers, however they define it, and
found the most effective one (C)?</p>

<p>For the claim to be true, when you look at career C, you must
independently see that what it is addressing is B and the global
problem it is working on is A. Otherwise, that claim is false.</p>

<p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>Reply</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong>***</p>

<p>When we have â€œmostâ€, the work needed to give one example for that
claim becomes n-times (where n is the number of items in the set). For
example, if we talk about â€œmost careersâ€ we need to evaluate the
â€œeffectivenessâ€ of all of these n careers.</p>

<p>For [1], I canâ€™t compare all careers practically, so what should I do?
how big should the set practically be? what do you expect? Is it good
enough to show say 5 careers that are â€œtopâ€ according to 80k and go
from there?</p>

<p>For [2], I can look at say 3 of the bottlenecks to progress of [3].</p>

<p>For [3], I can probably compare the top 5 80khours set of careers that
they think is pressing</p>

<p>Is that ok? or?</p>

<p>SST has been re-activated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After your (PhD)[1], itâ€™s hard to (re-enter academia if you
leave)[2]</p>

  <p>Claim: After [1], its hard to [2]</p>

  <p>Was not able to find an example online for someone who came back to
academia and how â€œhardâ€ it was for him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way is to look at the rejection rate, if available, for
professorship or post-doctoral fellowship for those who went to the
industry after PhD. This data may not be publicly available, but
professors who are on the hiring committee would know and would be
able to tell people like 80k. They could tell you if they expected
higher results from those who left academia.</p>

<p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>Reply</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong>***
So when I come across such claims, what do you expect from me? I think
I searched for atleast an hour regarding this. Should I skip these? or
should I make a comment like you have done above (â€œrejection rate â€¦â€)?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can also (support the work of other researchers)[1] in a
(complementary role, such as a project manager, executive assistant,
fundraiser or operations)[2]. Weâ€™ve argued (these roles)[3] are
often neglected, and therefore especially high-impact. Itâ€™s often
useful to have (graduate training in the relevant area)[4] before
taking these roles.</p>

  <p>Claim: It is good to [1] in [2].</p>

  <p>I think it is important to contrast it with something otherwise it
is hard for someone to understand if it is good or bad. Agree: to
always contrast?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They arenâ€™t claiming that it is â€œgoodâ€. They are claiming that it is
â€œespecially high-impactâ€. They should have a rough cutoff for how many
lives or dollars or whatever constitute â€œlow-impactâ€, â€œhigh-impactâ€,
or â€œespecially high-impactâ€. Then, you wonâ€™t need to contrast against
anything else.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I have covered the â€œespecially high impactâ€ in the next claim
â€œ[3] is high-impactâ€. I see your point, the first 2 sentences could
have been combined to 1, and I would have only one claim to answer. I
usually look at sentences in isolation when I write claims, unless
they are connected by words like â€œthese rolesâ€. I will try and be
aware of this thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But 80khours believes in WORDS like â€œhigh-impactâ€, what do you expect
from me when I send you these things for feedback? Is the example I
have good enough for now? or?</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example</strong>: As discussed earlier, AI safety is really quite
neglected with 100 people working on it with 10m
<span>$</span>. Neil Bowerman from 80khours is trying to add
people required to fill the â€œtalent gapsâ€. If Neil is able to
add 10 more people and even claim 1% of their total impact that
would be 570 lives saved just for his work in a few
years. Contrast that to a DS job which saves 400 people over a
life time.</p>

  <p>There is no doubting the (force of the arguments)[1] the problem is
a (research challenge worthy of the next generationâ€™s best
mathematical talent)[2]. (Human civilization)[3] is at stake.</p>

  <p>Claim: There is no doubting [1].</p>

  <p>Question: Why is there no doubting [1]?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Empirically false. Plenty of people doubted it before AI safety went
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/495759307346952192?lang=en">mainstream</a> in late 2014. Many still doubt it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another digital macher who agrees is Marc Andreessen, a creator of
the original Netscape browser and now a Silicon Valley VC. In one of
his recent tweet-storms he addressed the subject: â€œI donâ€™t see any
reason to believe there will suddenly be some jump where all of a
sudden they are like super-human intelligence,â€ he tweeted, and,
â€œThe singularity AI stuff is all just a massive handwave, â€˜At some
point magic happens.â€™ Nobody has any theory for what this is.â€</p>

<p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>Reply</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong>***</p>

<p>This seems to be another â€œmost effective careersâ€ moment, where the
word â€œmostâ€â€”and in this case â€œNOâ€â€”is critical. Either I provide,
every example of people not doubting [1]. Or I provide 1 example for
doubting and I am done. Correct me if I am wrong!</p>

  <p>Claim: [3] is at stake (because of AI).</p>

  <p>Example:</p>

  <p>The fate of Gorillas currently depends on the actions of
humans. They are currently endangered. Similarly the fate of
humanity may come to depend on the actions of machines than our own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, we have no concrete example. If they said that
diseases put human civilization at stake, we can point to the Black
Plague, which killed nearly half the people of Western Europe. Or
nukes (Japan). Or asteroids (dinosaurs).</p>

<p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>Reply</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong>***</p>

<p>Because they are predicting something of the future, you are saying
there is no example!</p>

<p>But we can imagine one concrete way atleast (Russia using an
autonomous weapon system resulting in war) where [3] is at stake due
to AI. Isnâ€™t that the point though, that we do â€œconcrete thinkingâ€
aka, remove the words and think of examples (hypothetical as they may
be)? Why do you seem to be against hypothetical examples?</p>

transportation using horses or a boat went on to railroads, steam
boats and automobiles.</p>

<p>â€œmostâ€.</p>

<p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>Reply</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong>***</p>

<p>But how will the example look then?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: So I would need to compare the industrial revolution to
the only other â€œpopularâ€ revolutionâ€”agricultural revolutionâ€”and
compare it to show which one was â€œprofoundâ€. Correct?</p>

<p>If there are 10 other revolutions, do you expect me within the scope
of this document to compare all 10 and identify which one was the
â€œmost profoundâ€?</p>

machines with intelligence which far surpasses our own)[9]. These
range from (Stephen Hawking to Stuart Russell, the author of the
best-selling AI textbook, AI: A Modern Approach)[10].</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not. There are <a href="https://intelligence.org/files/PredictingAI.pdf" title="page 15">polls</a> of AI experts asking when they think

<blockquote>
  <p>how to do I give an example for â€œcould lead toâ€? I donâ€™t think I
have given one above!â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We donâ€™t have concrete examples for â€œcould happenâ€</strong>, because it would
then be â€œdid happenâ€. Should ask them why they are so confident if
they havenâ€™t seen any concrete examples.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have no idea how to answer this claim, how do I give an example
that will inform if A then B.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, itâ€™s great if there is a concrete example, such as â€œif you boil
water on the stove, it will evaporateâ€ - I saw it myself. But if not,
you have to <strong>mark the claim as â€œno concrete exampleâ€</strong>.</p>

<p>Another sentence: â€œGiven that we want batsmen who are short and have
curly hair, here are the batsmen we found: Sachin Tendulkar, â€¦â€</p>

<p>Giving an example of Jacques Kallis would be wrong because he isnâ€™t
short and doesnâ€™t have curly hair. Ricky Ponting would be wrong

<p>â€œGenerating ideas for new career pathsâ€. Maybe AI is tough for someone
because he has no CS skills, but he could switch from political
science to a PhD in economics. The list gives concrete examples of
careers they could consider. Imagine if they didnâ€™t. You might never
even â€œgenerate the ideaâ€ of a PhD in economics. Or you might go for
something like becoming a dentist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Mozart)[8] scored a (130 percent on the precocity index)[9] whereas
(his current contemporaries)[10] scored (thirty to five-hundred
percent)[10a].</p>

  <p>Claim: [8] scored [9].</p>

  <p>Example: All this probably requires is a citation? agree?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is already a concrete example, not a claim</strong>. A claim would be
something like â€œMozart isnâ€™t a lot more precocious than modern child
pianistsâ€, for which you would give the above example.</p>

<p>Mission #9: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
concretely analyze the key claims in the book Superintelligence by
Nick Bostrom (the book mentioned in the Elon Musk tweet above). Heâ€™s a
PhD at Oxford whoâ€™s been writing about AI safety along with guys like
Eliezer for nearly two decades. The book has detailed arguments and
examples about all the topics like possible paths to
â€œsuperintelligenceâ€ (whatever that means), types of
â€œsuperintelligenceâ€, the control problem, etc.</p>

<p>No need to write â€œQuestion: â€œ - doesnâ€™t seem to have changed your
answers.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t have to go sentence by sentence; look at one key claim for each
section, usually the one in the first few paragraphs, or one for each
paragraph if you feel itâ€™s an important section. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHAPTER 2 Paths to superintelligence</p>

  <p>Machines are currently far inferior to humans in general
intelligence. Yet one day (we have suggested) they will be
superintelligent. How do we get from here to there? This chapter
explores several conceivable technological paths. We look at
artificial intelligence, whole brain emulation, biological
cognition, and human-machine interfaces, as well as networks and
organizations. We evaluate their different degrees of plausibility
as pathways to superintelligence. The existence of multiple paths
increases the probability that the destination can be reached via at
least one of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key claim is â€œHow do we get from here to there? Answer: Artificial
intelligence, whole brain emulation, â€¦â€</p>

<p>Feedback checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Could it be that this claim has no/any example at all? For example,
â€œcivilization is at stakeâ€ or â€œ5, could lead to extremely positive
developmentsâ€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could this claim be false? Remember the â€œthere is no doubtingâ€
example. (Could there be other examples that can disprove this?
Have you thought about it?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this claim say anything about â€œbestâ€ (need to compare against
the entire set) or â€œmostâ€ (need to show itâ€™s the majority in the
set) or â€œnoâ€ (need to show that nothing in the set matches)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did you stick to examples that are in the chapter itself? That way
you donâ€™t have to search online for too long.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did you use a running example for a technical phrase? There will be
lots of new phrases in the book, like â€œconvergent instrumental
valueâ€ and â€œorthogonality thesisâ€. Whenever you see them, you
should recall whatever running example youâ€™ve used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is an â€œif-thenâ€ claim, did you either get a concrete
example or mark it as having no example?</p>

    <p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>addition</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>*
or is there an If (â€œif you are especially motivated by one of themâ€
example) or Given (Given Short black hair, Jacques kallis will not
fit there in that claim) in the statement? Have you used them
appropriately in the example?

  </li>
</ol>

<p>Short names: none; false; best; chapter; running; if-then.</p>

<p>Please refer to the checklist after every claim analysis to ensure
youâ€™re not making old mistakes. If you want to add to the checklist
based on mistakes found in past feedback, thatâ€™s great.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Could it have examples? â€œcivilization is at stake due to AIâ€
(consider the possibility it has not exaples)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True or false? Yes â€œThere is no doubting the
force of the argumentâ€ (consider a falsifying example)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>best most no comparison?  (consider if you need to compare)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From chapter?  (consider examples from chapter)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running? (is it a running example like talking about the same thing)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
