I"Q¹<p><strong>Status</strong>: This is an essay where I horribly failed to think
â€œconcretelyâ€.</p>

<p><em>I am deeply grateful to Aaron Gertler who reviewed this article for
over 3hrs atleast (I donâ€™t know the upper bound). His comments were
very thorough (he didnâ€™t leave any hyperlink unclicked). He managed to
question several of my claims. I have updated parts of this post based
on his comments. I also want to thank STM, Carrick Flynn, Peter Hurford,
<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/ea-applicant">EA Applicant</a>, Jon Behar, Ben West, 80,000 hours for helping me
directly or indirectly. They provided valuable info in their
posts/comments/email which I have used in this article. That said,
again, they should not be viewed as endorsing anything in this. All
mistakes are mine. All views are mine.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I have been using <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> (80k) since 2017 and have read
almost all their posts, spent weeks after weeks reading them to figure
out what I should be doing in life. They seem to have done a ton of
research and put out many many posts, for us readers to benefit from.</p>

<p>In the process they have made a lot of claims which are hard and
time-consuming to verify as we donâ€™t have the insights, contacts or
the data that 80k is exposed to. For example <a href="https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/#global-priorities">they estimate</a> â€œan
additional person working on the most effective issues will have over
100 times as much impact as an additional person working on a typical
issueâ€. To verify this with one example, I would need estimates from
say Open Phil on the impact of an employee. I tried, but they are
unable to put effort into it at the moment.</p>

<p>Maybe 80k can be asked for clarification directly? Unfortunately, 80k
doesnâ€™t seem approachable other than through coaching<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (which is
only for the stellar). <a href="http://disq.us/p/1tkqy0u">Comments sections seem to be deserted to ask
for help</a>, and at the time, I didnâ€™t know of any other sources
doing this sort of research and coaching for people<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Based on
reading 80k for years I formed the impression as shared by fellow <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really">EA
applicant</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey you! You know, all these ideas that you had about making the
world a better place, like working for Doctors without Borders?
They probably arenâ€™t that great. The long-term future is what
matters. And that is not funding constrained, so earning to give is
kind of off the table as well. But the good news is, we really,
really need people working on these things. We are so talent
constrainedâ€¦â€” <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really">EA applicant in the EA Forum</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And looking at the <em>277 karma</em> this post got (<em>the highest of any post
on the Forum</em>), it might appear that a â€œlot of peopleâ€ share(d)
this sentiment that EA orgs could potentially be seriously Talent
Constrained (TC).</p>

<p>A few weeks back I stumbled upon some articles in the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/">EA forum</a>
and to my surprise it appeared that some EA orgs were suggesting that
they were not TC. Until this point I donâ€™t think it occurred to me
that 80kâ€™ claims (â€œEA is TCâ€) could be wrong or lost in
translation or that I should test it. Nevertheless, having seen orgs
say otherwise, it felt like a good idea to dig into it at least now.</p>

<p>The following article is my naive investigation on if EA is TC. Before
we start going deep into whether EA is TC or not, we must first state
the definition clearly.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>We are going to primarily deal with the term â€œTalent
Constrainedâ€ (TC). 80k defines TC in â€œ<a href="https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/#what-are-talent-gaps">Why you should work on
Talent gaps</a>â€ (Nov 2015) as,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some causes, additional money can buy substantial progress. In
others, the key bottleneck is finding people with a specific skill
set. This second set of causes are more â€œtalent constrainedâ€ than
â€œfunding constrainedâ€; we say they have a â€œtalent gapâ€.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, a cause is TC if finding people with a specific skill set, proves
to be difficult. The difficulty I assume is in the lack of those
skilled people, and not some process/management constraint<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. â€œ<a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/talent-constraints-vs-funding-constraints/">EA
Concepts</a>â€, clears this confusion up with a better worded
â€œexampleâ€:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Organization A: Has annual funding of $5m, so can fund more staff,
and has been actively hiring for a year, but has been unable to find
anyone suitableâ€¦ Organization A is more talent constrained than
funding constrainedâ€¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this post, discussions are focused on <em>Orgs that are TC</em> and not
<em>Causes that are TC</em>. When I read that <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RCvetzfDnBNFX7pLH/personal-thoughts-on-careers-in-ai-policy-and-strategy">AI strategy is TC with the
lack of â€œDisentanglement Researchâ€ (DR)</a>, I donâ€™t know what to do about
it. But if I know FHI and many other orgs are TC in DR, then I could
potentially upskill in DR, and close the talent gap. So looking at
causes for me, is less helpful, less concrete and is not what I have
set out to understand.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-think-ea-is-tc">Why I think EA is TC</h2>

<p>EA has been and is talent constrained, according to surveys based on
input from several EA orgs<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>: <a href="https://80000hours.org/2017/11/talent-gaps-survey-2017/">2017 survey</a>, <a href="https://80000hours.org/2018/10/2018-talent-gaps-survey/#appendix-2-answers-to-open-comment-questions">2018 survey</a>,
<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TpoeJ9A2G5Sipxfit/ea-leaders-forum-survey-on-ea-priorities-data-and-analysis">2019 survey</a>. These surveys were conducted by 80k and CEA.
In all the surveys EAs on average claim to be more Talent Constrained
than Funding Constrained. For example, in 2019 EA orgs reported feeling
more Talent Constrained (3 out of 5 rating) and less Funding
Constrained (1 out of 5 rating)<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>80k doesnâ€™t seem to have changed itâ€™s position on this matter
since a while. In 2015, 80k suggested that we should focus on
providing talent to the community rather than ETG, in <a href="https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/">â€œWhy you should
focus on talent gaps and not funding gapsâ€</a>. One of the examples
they give is about AI Safety where there are people who are ready to
donate even more funds, but think there isnâ€™t enough â€œtalent
poolâ€. More posts such as <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/">â€œWorking at EA orgs</a> (June 2017), <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-desperately-needs-ai-strategists-heres-how-to-become-one/">â€œThe
world desperately needs AI strategists</a> (June 2017), â€œ<a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/">Why
operations management is the biggest bottleneck in EA</a>â€ (March
2018), and <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/high-impact-careers/">High-Impact-Careers</a> (Aug 2018), continue to make the
case for EA orgs being TC. Even in their recent post, <a href="https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/#priority-paths">â€œKey
Ideasâ€</a> (October 2019)â€“which is mostly recycled from the 2018 article
on <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/high-impact-careers/">High-Impact-Careers</a>â€“they continue to say that the bottleneck
to GPR for example, is researchers and operations people<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In Nov 2018, they wrote a post to clarify any misconceptions regarding
the understanding of the term TC: <a href="https://80000hours.org/2018/11/clarifying-talent-gaps/">â€œThink twice before talking about
Talent gapsâ€</a>. 80k informs us that EA orgs are not TC in general
but are TC by specific skills. Some examples (according to them)
being, people capable of Disentanglement Research in Strategy and
Policy (FHI, OpenAI, Deepmind), dedicated people in influential
government positions etcâ€¦ This is great, the claim is becoming
narrower: <em>EA is TC in specifically X</em>. So what is this X?</p>

<h2 id="where-is-the-ea-specifically-tc">Where is the EA specifically TC</h2>

<p>There seem to be a list of posts from 80k from which we can
gather where EA is specifically TC. They are:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>The surveys</strong> from 2017 to 2019 that informed us that the EA Orgs
are TC, provide information on â€œwhat sort of talent the EA orgs and EA
as a whole would need more of, in the next 5 years?â€. This question
sounds like a proxy to â€œWhere is EA specifically TC?â€. 80k seems
to agree with this proxy-approximation of the question as evidenced
<a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/high-impact-careers/#our-list-of-priority-paths">here</a><sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> and <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#what-skills-are-the-organisations-most-short-of">here</a><sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.

<p>* High level overview of EA<br />
*** Government and Policy</p>

<p>For the talents that are unclear<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, I am unable to do anything with
them at the moment. For the ones that I have clear examples for, I
proceed further.</p>

<p>Another way to arrive at or to supplement this list, is to look at the
<strong><a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/high-impact-careers/#our-list-of-priority-paths">top problem profiles</a></strong> and check what the bottlenecks are. For
example, in the <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/#what-can-you-do-to-help">profile on shaping AI</a> (March 2017), we see that
80k calls for people to help in AI Technical research, AI
Strategy and Policy, Complimentary roles and, Advocacy and Capacity
building. So basically EVERYTHING IN AI except ETG, is TC (it
appears). In the problem profile on <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/#what-is-most-needed-to-solve-this-problem">GPR</a> (July 2018), 80k
suggests that they mainly need researchers trained in math, econ, phil
etcâ€¦ Also needed are academic managers and operations staff. A very
similar story for <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#what-skills-are-the-organisations-most-short-of">working at EA orgs</a> as well.</p>

<p>Is it just me or is EA TC in â€œgeneralâ€? Like when researchers,
operations people and managers are in shortage at GPR orgs, AI orgs
and other EA orgs, then who else is left?</p>

<p>In the post on <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/high-impact-careers/#why-did-we-choose-these-categories">High Impact Careers</a> (August 2018), 80k
suggests the following <strong>priority career paths</strong> and what they are
constrained by:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In brief, we think our list of top problems (AI safety, biorisk, EA,
GPR, nuclear security, institutional decision-making) are mainly
constrained by research insights, either those that directly solve
the issue or insights about policy solutions. â€” <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/high-impact-careers/">High Impact
Careers</a></p>
</blockquote>

<!--- AI strategy and Policy research
- AI safety technical research
- Grant maker focused on top areas
- Work in effective Altruism orgs
- Global priorities researcher
- Bio-risk strategy and policy
- China Specialists
- Earning to give in quant trading
- Decision making psychology research and roles-->

<p>In <strong>focused bottleneck posts</strong> for Operations and AI Strategy just
the title already informs how TC the situation is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-desperately-needs-ai-strategists-heres-how-to-become-one/">The world desperately needs AI strategists</a> (June 2017)</p>

    <p>Here, other than the title, I didnâ€™t really understand the
  â€œdesperate need for AI strategistsâ€. Miles expects that â€œmanyâ€
  jobs would open up in the â€œfutureâ€.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/#which-traits-do-you-need">Why operations management is one of the biggest bottlenecks in
effective altruism</a> (March 2018)</p>

    <p>80k updated this post one year later saying that the post is
â€œsomewhat out of dateâ€, and that the job market has changed over the
last year. That sounds plausible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, the surveys say GRs, ML/AI people, GPR people and
movement building are TC (2019). The problem profiles seem to suggest
that GPR and AI are completely TC except for ETG (2017,2018). Whereas
the High-impact-careers post says that research insights (good
researchers) and policy solutions (good policy people) are the most
constrained (2018). It appears that there is some discrepancy between
different articlesâ€“every article doesnâ€™t seem to say the same
thingâ€“but we move on with the key message that all these things
listed could be potentially TC. But are they really TC though?</p>

<h2 id="the-evidence">The Evidence</h2>

<p><strong>GR in GPR</strong></p>

<p>Researchers in GPR are claimed to be constrained. GRâ€™s also stand on
top of the survey lists shown before, for 2019. Yet, <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting">Open Phil seems
to paint a very different picture</a>. For the recent hiring round by
Open Phil (started in Feb 2018 and ended in December 2018) they wanted
to hire 5 GRs. They report that more than a 100 strong resumes with
missions aligned to that of Open Phil were received. 59 of them were selected
after remote work tests and went into an interview. Of this, 17 of
them were offered a 3 month trial and 5 selected in the end. â€œMultiple
peopleâ€ they met in this round are claimed to have potential to excel
in roles at Open Phil in the future. Open Phil does not seem to feel
that there is a lack of skilled people. It appears that they had
plenty to choose from and that they have found suitable candidates.</p>

<p>A similar case is observed with EAF. In <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/d3cupMrngEArCygNk/takeaways-from-eaf-s-hiring-round">EAFâ€™s November 2018 hiring
round</a> they wanted to hire 1 GR (<a href="https://ea-foundation.org/open-position-research-analyst/">for grant evaluation</a>) and 1
operations person. <em>Within just 2 weeks, 66 people applied to this
EA org which was in a <a href="./career-2020-where-to-work-2.html">non-hub</a></em><sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>. These 66 trickled down to 10
interviews after work tests, 4 were offered trials and 2 were selected
in the end. No TC in GR here either.</p>

<p>Would Open Phil like to hire more GRs? For sure, but they donâ€™t have
the capability to deploy such a pool of available talent, they
say. They seem to be constrained by something else, something not
â€œtalentâ€.</p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>AI Strategy and Policy</strong></p>

<p>Researchers in AI Strategy and Policy are also claimed to be
constrained. The surveys echo the same as well. But <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RCvetzfDnBNFX7pLH/personal-thoughts-on-careers-in-ai-policy-and-strategy">Carrick from
FHI</a> (Sep 2017) suggests that AI Policy implementation and research
work is essentially on hold until Disentanglement Research
progresses. And that even <em>â€œextremely talented peopleâ€ will not be
able to contribute directly</em> until then. Similar to Open Phil,
institutional capacity to absorb and utilize more researchers in
Strategy is constrained, according to Carrick. It must be noted that
this is just one persons view on the matter and that a stronger
version of evidence for this would be if several AI orgs agreed with
Carrickâ€™s view.</p>

<p><em>Except for the TC in Disentanglement research (DR)</em>â€”where there
seems to be large demand and if you meet the bar, you will get a
jobâ€”there seems to be no sign of TC in Strategy and Policy, at the
moment.</p>

<p>Once DR progresses, there would be a need for â€œa lot of AI
researchersâ€, Carrick expects. Itâ€™s been 2.5 years since the post by
Carrick, and as late as Nov 2018, <a href="https://80000hours.org/2018/11/clarifying-talent-gaps/">80k continues to cite Carrickâ€™s
article</a>. This seems to suggest that not much might have changed. I
<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RCvetzfDnBNFX7pLH/personal-thoughts-on-careers-in-ai-policy-and-strategy?commentId=a2o5mTK2YuZswqic6">have tried requesting Carrick</a> to write a reboot of his initial
post and hopefully he can further clarify the TC or lack there of.</p>

<!--**Note**: *This article by Carrick was written in September 2017
and I am not sure what is the update in Feb 2020. Most articles on [AI
strategy and Policy are written in
2017](https://80000hours.org/topic/priority-paths/ai-policy/). As late
as November 2018, this article by Carrick is still being [cited by
80k](https://80000hours.org/2018/11/clarifying-talent-gaps/). This
suggests that they might not have changed "much". But they claim in
the future they would need "a lot of AI researchers" working on
this.*-->

<p><strong>Researchers and Management staff in other EA orgs</strong></p>

<p>The co-founder and board member of Rethink Charity seems to suggest
that both senior and junior staff for Rethink Charity and Charity
Science were not hard to find, aka not TC.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™ve certainly had no problem finding junior staff for Rethink
Priorities, Rethink Charity, or Charity Science (Note: Rethink
Priorities is part of Rethink Charity but both are entirely separate
from Charity Science)â€¦ and so far weâ€™ve been lucky enough to have
enough strong senior staff applications that weâ€™re still finding
ourselves turning down really strong applicants we would otherwise
really love to hire.â€”<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC">Peter Hurford says in the 2019 survey</a></p>

<p>The Life You Can Saveâ€™s Jon Behar, <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=tojT8rKhwCz9rfJbB">agrees with Peter</a>. He adds
that itâ€™s not the lack of talent but the lack of money to add new
staff which is the bottleneck for TLYCS.</p>

<p>Charity Entrepreneurshipâ€™s incubation program has grown from <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship">140
applications</a> to ~2000 applications for 15-20 positions since last
year. Itâ€™s plausibly not TC this year atleast.</p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>An org is TC in Talent X, if it is not able to find â€œskilledâ€ people
despite â€œhiring activelyâ€. So far we have seen that Open Phil, EAF,
Rethink Charity, Charity Science, TLYCS and FHI, are able to find the
skilled people they needâ€“except for one concrete example of
Disentanglement Research in FHI (and possibly similar institutes).
Contrary to the claims from 80k, it appears that several orgs are
not TC.</p>

<p>I am really upset with 80k. First it was focusing too much on career
capital (CC) and positions like management consulting, and now
TC. Getting into the TC debate only opened a Pandoraâ€™s box of more
issues. Recently, I discovered that their discussion on
<a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#but-wont-i-be-replaceable">replaceability</a> is plausibly <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=sCXPW4BWKWdkdyK2q">wrong</a>. They have <a href="https://80000hours.org/search/?cx=007036038893981741514%3Ad-war0ad7jy&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;q=replaceability">gone back and

They <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#how-to-assess-your-personal-fit">severely
downplayed how competitive it is to get jobs in EA orgs</a><sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>. And
there are <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really">so many cases</a><sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> of people who feel the same way, not
without reason. I traveled with 80k on the CC hype and spent months on
identifying positions of â€œmaximum CCâ€<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote">14</a></sup>. Then I did a 1 year course
of Data Science at Coursera. After that I jumped onto the
<em>work-at-an-EA-org-because-TC</em> hype and was just about to upskill in
statistics and apply for GR positions because <em>they need me</em>.</p>

<p>So many crucial mistakes that cost people like me and others<sup id="fnref:12:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> a
lot of time, and the world a â€œlot ofâ€ dollars. And when someone
requests one of the members of 80k to not just serve the elite
and that perhaps maybe invest in a small conversation with the
non-elite EAs to save them years of wasting time, <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really?commentId=no7FouoZDjPZuxCwr">there is no
reply</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, I find it very hard to trust the claims listed in 80k. And there
are so <a href="https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/">many of those</a> claims in every post and itâ€™s just
impractical to verify each one of them. Rather than relying on the
interpretation of English<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote">15</a></sup> and generalization of advice for
everyone, I find EA forums a much easier place to get information
from, challenge claims and get responses for (quickly). I found most
of the evidence against TC including the Pandoraâ€™s box of issues,
there. A lot of the successful people from the EA world seem
approachable there with chats, comments and AMAs. Recently I was able
to chat with Ben West, Aaron Gertler, Peter Hurford, Jon Behar, Jeff
Kaufman and Stefan Torges. A bigger celebrity list of people can be
seen commenting in posts, such as Carrick Flynn and 80kâ€™s very own Rob
Wiblin.</p>

<!-- Why "so many" organizations reported that they were TC in the surveys -->
<!-- is hard to determine. Maybe it was a generalization problem or the -->
<!-- times changed too quickly or things got lost in translation or the -->
<!-- definition changed over time or something else. I can only speculate. -->

<h2 id="final-message">Final message</h2>

<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Just because an org is not TC, it doesnâ€™t mean that you
should reject that org.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this debate so important?</strong></p>

<p>Whether an org is TC or not, has implications on the impact made. The
true impact you make when a job is TC at an EA org is (much) higher,
than when the job is not TC. A junior GR at GiveWell is expected to
move 2.4m<span>$</span> if the job was TC. The same GR is expected to
move only <a href="https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/">244k</a> in the case that the hired GR is better than the
next-best-candidate by 10% (Not TC). Such is the distinction between
being TC and not.</p>

<p>The above example assumes no <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#but-wont-i-be-replaceable">spillover effects</a>. But is that
correct? Why is there no spillover? Should I work in EA or not? How
much value do people really get out of working at an EA org? What is
best path for my aspiring EA career?</p>

<p>Stay tunedâ€¦</p>

<!--Consider A and B applying for a job at an EA org that is not TC. This
means it is A can contribute 500k<span>$</span> value and B can
contribute 400k<span>$</span> value for the same job. For simplicity,
let's assume they produce little or no value if A or B does not take
take up that job.

Total value created for the world if A sits idle at home: 400k  
Total value created if A takes the job: 500k.  
Total value if A does ETG (for 100k) and B takes the job: 500k -->

  <p>BTW: http://agent18.github.io/is-ea-bottlenecked-2.html (Uyir a

feedback on writing, any potential claim evidence fuckups etcâ€¦)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would pause immediately at the term â€œtalent-constrainedâ€. I donâ€™t
understand it. The first step is to describe the claim â€œX is
talent-constrainedâ€ in terms of <strong>familiar claims</strong> so that you can
actually test the claim against evidence. Do you mean that there is a
low rejection rate for PhD applicants?</p>

<p>A related issue is that, for the same claim, youâ€™re <strong>switching between
evidence in the form of surveys and evidence in the form of rejection
rates</strong>. If the claim is about rejection rates, then you either have the
numbers or you donâ€™t. If you donâ€™t, you canâ€™t test that claim against
a concrete example. If the claim is about surveys, then youâ€™ll have to
use the survey. Right now, youâ€™re taking the same claim and mixing
multiple kinds of evidence, such as surveys and 80k opinion posts and
rejection rates, which left me at the end with no clear answer.</p>

<p>So, split the different kinds of claims: â€œEA has high rejection ratesâ€
and â€œEA surveys have high percentages saying the words â€˜we are
talent-constrainedâ€™â€. You can even make the claims more precise:
â€œOperations manager roles have high rejection rates for candidates
with 2 years of similar experienceâ€ - notice how you can immediately
test that claim given concrete examples.</p>

<p>Contrast that to â€œIn brief, we think our list of top problems â€¦ are
mainly constrained by research insightsâ€. How do you test that given
some data? Imagine if theyâ€™d said â€œSalaries went up by 20% last year
but number of open questions solved in published papers went down by
40%â€. We can debate whether â€œnumber of open questions solvedâ€ has been
a useful metric but thereâ€™s no question that we can test that claim
against evidence.</p>

<hr />

<p>On a different note, a key point that is missing from the analysis,
here and elsewhere, is that we talk about a shortage <strong><em>for a given
price</em></strong>. We donâ€™t say that there is no supply of onions. We say there
is no supply of onions at Rs 10/kg. When the price has eventually
risen due to lack of supply, people have even transported onions from
other countries to supply them for a profit.</p>

<p>Saying that there is a lack of â€œtalentâ€ or researchers for a given
role doesnâ€™t make much sense unless you talk about the current
salary. But people are talking as though, no matter the salary, there
is not enough talent in the world to do this research. People have in
the past moved from country to country and from job to job for higher
pay (and other desired characteristics like climate and family
members). There are a lot of well-published PhDs and postdocs working
on all kinds of other research areas for much less than six-figures
and a lot of professors and researchers working for not too much
more. Is the claim that they wonâ€™t switch for a 2x salary or that they
canâ€™t study and catch up on the slightly different field in a few
years? If the EA organizations were â€œdesperateâ€ for a particular kind
of researcher, did they raise the salary a lot? If they didnâ€™t have
enough funds to raise salaries, then arenâ€™t
theyâ€¦ â€œfunding-constrainedâ€? Are the two â€œconstraintsâ€ actually
distinct?</p>

<hr />

<p>Mission #6: For now, I recommend <strong>rewriting the post after splitting
the claims till you have narrow claims</strong> that are either tested with
examples or donâ€™t have any available examples. <strong>Check if</strong> you see
any lingering confusion or <strong>ambiguity</strong> at the end. One week should
be enough time.</p>

from EA forum puts it well:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I could be mistaken, but it would seem odd to say youâ€™re â€œfunding
constrainedâ€ but canâ€™t use more funding at the moment. Whereas we
are saying orgs are â€œtalent constrainedâ€ but canâ€™t make use of
available talentâ€¦ I feel a â€œtalent bottleneckâ€ implies an
insufficient supply of talent/applicants, which doesnâ€™t seem to be
the case. I guess itâ€™s more that thereâ€™s insufficient talent
actually working on the problems, but itâ€™s not a matter of supply,
so itâ€™s more of a â€œhiring bottleneckâ€ or an â€œorganizational capacity
bottleneckâ€.â€”<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pzEJmc5gRskHjGTak/many-ea-orgs-say-they-place-a-lot-of-financial-value-on?commentId=r3vv6HWvZ8riBfLEM#r3vv6HWvZ8riBfLEM">Joel EA Forum</a></p>

      <p>There are several talents listed in the surveys which I donâ€™t
understand. I donâ€™t have any examples for what they could mean. For
example, â€œCommunications other than marketing and movement buildingâ€,
â€œhigh level knowledge and enthusiasm about effective altruismâ€ and
â€œbroad general knowledge about many relevant topicsâ€.  Some of the
other â€œtalentsâ€ mentioned seem too generalized.  When I think of
â€œone-on-one social skillsâ€, it could be referring to anything like
policy people talking to politicians, or Career Counselors convincing
people to change their career path, or even people in the frontline of
fundraising. If the surveyors wanted to inform the community that
frontline fundraisers are required with â€œgood social skillsâ€ (whatever
that means), then exactly that in the survey seems much more
beneficial than what they have currently done. Contrast this to
talents such as GR or Operations. It is clear what these mean. For GR
I can think of researchers at Open Phil or GiveWell. For operations I
think of Tara from FHI.Â <a href="#fnref:20" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>I am not a big fan of these broad terminologies as they donâ€™t allow ME
to act on them. For example, â€œBest ways to gain Career Capital (CC)
are: Work at a growing organisation that has a reputation for high
performance; Getting a graduate degree; Working in Tech sector; Taking
a data science job; Working in think tanks; Making â€œgood connectionsâ€,
Having runway etcâ€¦ â€œ Literally everything under the sun.</p>

      <p>I am unable to act on it. I could in theory pursue everything. I donâ€™t
know how to compare which has higher CC and lower CC. The definition
says: â€œCC puts you in a better position to make a difference in the
future, including skills, connections, credentials and runway.â€ When I
work in Data Science in a FAANG job do I have higher CC compared to
when I work on a computer science degree? I donâ€™t know.</p>

      <p>Economists routinely measure the impact of high-school dropout vs
high-school diploma vs some years of college but dropout vs undergrad
degree vs grad degree, in different fields, using the variable â€œmedian
weekly earningsâ€ or â€œlifetime earningsâ€. So when someone says, â€œyou
need a degree to get ahead in lifeâ€, I can imagine what they mean $470
weekly wage increase. Whereas when someone says, â€œComputer Science PhD
is good CCâ€, I am lost. Contrast that to saying â€œBest ways to gain CC
is by looking at earningsâ€. Then I could look at median earnings for
Data Science Faang job vs Phd in computer science in say top 20
university (based on my capability) and get ahead in life.Â <a href="#fnref:19" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
