I"ñò<h2 id="goal">Goal<a id="sec-0-1" name="sec-0-1"></a></h2>

<p>I want to create maximum impact over my entire career. It could be either
by earning-to-give or by gaining sufficient career captial and using
that to create the max impact, by founding companies or using my
research knowledge. When I say Career capital, I refer to skills,
runway, connections that I could gain while in a job that could help
me further my goals.</p>

<p>I am 26 right now (soon to be 27) and I would like to make the rest of the 80000 hrs
of my career count.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-look-into-the-what-has-been-done-in-the-past">A brief look into the what has been done in the past<a id="sec-0-2" name="sec-0-2"></a></h2>

<p>The career series of posts were written with the idea of helping me
understand what I needed to do w.r.t my career and how to get there.The
primary goal that is expected to drive all change and actions in my life
is based of this <a href="file:///Answers-finale.html">Answers</a> post.</p>

<p>So in <a href="file:///career.html">first career post</a> we saw some basics about careers and the
roughly took some data and saw where we could see ourselves in the
future. In the following post <a href="file:///career(2).html">on Dream Jobs</a>, we discussed what should
be there in a dream job, such as flow, moderate amount of stress
etc‚Ä¶  This post has a synopsis of the research on stress and my
final understanding, which is that stress is not really a very bad
thing to health. The post also contains some of my understanding, some evidence
regarding long hours, stress and vacation.</p>

<p><a href="file:///career(3).html">The next post (3)</a> was written for the sake of completeness i guess. It
talks about how one person can make a difference, pretty much echoing
the centiments shared by <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/">80k hours</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There‚Äôs no reason to be embarrassed by this fact, but it does
emphasize how important it is to consider how you can use your good
fortune to help others. In a more equal and intuitive world, we could
just focus on helping those around us, and making our own lives go
well. But it turns out we have an enormous opportunity to help other
people with little cost to ourselves ‚Äì and it would be a terrible
shame to squander it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="file:///career(4).html">the forth post</a> we see the existing problems in the world that need
attentiona and try to focus on a few of the problems and see where it
takes us, while briefly looking into what we need to do to maximize
our impact. With this post it is quite clear that there are several
opportunities, and a proper analysis needs to be made so that we can
start in this direction this year.</p>

<p>In <a href="file:///career(5).html">the fifth post</a> (5) we discuss about how the suggestion of <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/">80k hrs</a>
is to start with direct work if possible rather than earning to
give. As it is not a shortage of funds that is the major problem but
the using of the funds in an effective way or channelling funds to the
right medium to create large/right impact. This is quite an eye
opener, as earning to give seemed like the way to go a few months back.</p>

<p>All these posts are written not with a proper beginning or end. I
apologise. Most of the work was done on the last day with a deadline,
even with this post ( :( ). I think what would be best now would be to
summarize briefly the findings from 80k hours until now and use it to
see what directions are the best for me. Starting with say profiling
different fields, putting up my key uncertainities and maybe
estimating the impact of each direction that could be chosen.</p>

<p>Before that I also quickly make a synopsis of the 80k hours links‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="the-80k-guide">The 80K Guide<a id="sec-0-3" name="sec-0-3"></a></h2>

<h3 id="direct-work-vs-indirect-work-earning-to-give">Direct work vs indirect work (earning to give)<a id="sec-0-3-1" name="sec-0-3-1"></a></h3>

<p><a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/">
 80k hours high impact jobs</a> suggest the following as the different
ways to contribute:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Earning to give</li>
  <li>Advocacy</li>
  <li>Research</li>
  <li>Direct work</li>
</ul>

<p>According to <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/">80k hours website</a>, we see that we should first invest in
Direct working over long term, unless otherwise not possible. I can‚Äôt
imagine what my contribution does when it is a meager 4k euros. Yes
there are websites that allow you to calculate that. Roughly speaking
I can save one full life (according to GiveWell). I certainly think I
can do more, and as a human we want to maximize our potential.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should earn
to give long term.
we think that most people should be doing things like politics,
policy, high-value research, for-profit and non-profit
entrepreneurship, and direct work for highly socially valuable
organizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not fully sure when I will know direct work is not for me. Say I
was running a successful business, I guess I would focus on just that,
and pump hopefully in low 100k‚Äôs (25 lives) to effective
organizations.</p>

<p>And so, for now I would also like to look at how I can get to
directwork positions.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-an-area-to-focus">Choosing an area to focus<a id="sec-0-3-2" name="sec-0-3-2"></a></h3>

<p>Basically, work on neglected, solvable, personal-fit-making-sense,
expertise-making-sense type of problems .</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know now what problem I want to work on ( I should be working
on). There are so many unknowns and as expressed in <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-planning/">the career
planning part of the 80k hours website</a>, it is quite hard to determine
the next 25 years of your life. It is better to be broadly focussed
with transferrable skill to move to the place of most need. Hopefully
with time there is more clarity, skills shape up. But there is one
thing I need to do in every job or education, I need to excel. I need
to know my shit and be good at it.</p>

<p>What types of jobs do the worlds most important problems need? <a href="file:///career(5).html">This

career paths, pertain to a particular area of focus. This is what is
required for some of the areas in focus such as eradicating poverty,
improving health, artificial intelligence:</p>

<p>Either we,</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>become mathematicians, staticians or economicians

<p>80k hrs is very clear in their advice <strong>that we should look for opportunities of direct
impact rather</strong> than earning to give, to begin with.</p>

<p>People peak usually after 10 to 20 years of experience. Being successful takes
time. Invest in your now for a better impact tomorrow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, <strong>learning marketing or management</strong> is flexible because
almost all organisations need these skills; whereas becoming an expert
on Kenyan microfinance is not. - <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/">80k hours website on career capital</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read the story about Tara and constantly think that I am not that high
acheiver, what ever Tara touches turns to gold. But thats ok, things
take time, and I am going to be that acheiver. Let‚Äôs already start
learning something.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you‚Äôre really uncertain, then you could make flexible career
capital your main focus. As you learn more, you can make your plan
more and more targeted. (We‚Äôll cover how to do this in a later
article.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bear in mind, the advice ‚Äúbuild flexible career capital‚Äù is not the
same as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt close any doors‚Äù. Some people try to avoid committing
to a specific path because they‚Äôre unsure what to do. *Rather, the
advice is to commit to a path in which you‚Äôll gain career capital
that‚Äôs useful in many other paths. Just pick an area, perform highly,
learn valuable skills, and meet influential people.* You‚Äôll end up in
a better position than if you try to do a bit of everything and don‚Äôt
achieve anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the important pieces of advice without which I would
just continue to mentally masturbate. It is hard to predict already
what you can do in the future. It suggests to generically go for
something that I am a personal fit in and kill at it! As long as I am
in one of the fields they have talked about, I should be good? I
guess. They have done the research.</p>

<p><strong>Dont do a bit of everything!</strong> Mainly focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Working in any organisation which has, or with any people who have,
a reputation for high performance e.g. top consultancy or technology
firms, or any work with a great mentor or team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undertaking certain graduate studies, especially applied
quantitative subjects like economics, computer science and applied
mathematics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anything that gives you a valuable transferable skill e.g. programming, data</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>science, marketing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taking opportunities which allow you to achieve</li>
</ul>

<p>impressive and socially valuable things e.g. founding an organisation,
doing anything at which you might excel.**** Work at a growing
organisation that has a reputation for high performance</p>

<p>(The skill consulting/management seems to give you!)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consulting works because the companies make you work hard, train you
up, and put you around other productive people, building your skills
and connections. These jobs are also widely recognised as competitive
positions, which gives you a credential.*But there are many other
positions that can provide similar benefits.*</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>comparing two options interms of Career Capital</p>

    <p><strong>Skills</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>what will you learn in this job, and how fast will you learn?
You can break skills down into transferable skills, knowledge and
personality traits. Some especially useful transferable skills
include: personal productivity, analysis and problem-solving, the
ability to learn quickly, decision-making, social skills, and
management. We cover why and how to learn them in a later article. If
you want to do good, you also need to learn all about the world‚Äôs most
pressing problems and how to solve them. A job will be best for
learning when you are pushed to improve and get lots of feedback from
mentors.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The very best career capital comes from impressive achievements.</p>

      <p>Doing great work builds your reputation, and that allows you to make
connections with other high achievers.</p>

      <p>If you want to make a big difference in the world, you need something
valuable to contribute. Level up before you take on the big boss.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Connections</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>who will you work with and meet in this job? Your connections are how
you‚Äôll find opportunities, spread ideas and start new projects. The
people you spend time with also shape your character. For both
reasons, it‚Äôs important to make connections who are influential and
who care about social impact.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Credentials</strong></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>will this job act as a good signal to future collaborators or employers?</p>

    <p><strong>Runway</strong></p>

      <p>how much money will you save in this job?</p>

    <p><strong>Gaining flexible and future-proof career capital</strong></p>

    <p>Future proof:AI proof, that allows the ability to do other things based on interest and what is
needed at the particular hour!</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In general, the more uncertain you are about the future and your
career, the more important it is to gain career capital that‚Äôs
flexible.</p>

<p>What should we do over the next 10 or 20 years? What is the right

<p>I have no idea what to do in the medium term even. I am just looking
to either make huge money and gain career capital or just work
directly. But right now I have no idea how to evaluate what I could be
doing and if I could be doing that in 10 to 20 years. I think the
easier and much more soothing-to-the-ear option, due to my
uncertainity is to start off with buildng flexible career capital and
figure it out on the way what is best for me.</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-planning/">80k hours website</a> says the idea of figuring out what career will work
in the end for you is just like what the top people have to figure out
while makeing a startup. We need 3 plans:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Plan A, one where we see a top option, a personal fit which we feel
reasonably ok, in the medium term (5-10 years?). If we are uncertain
or very uncertain we shall look at building flexible career capital</p>

  <p>Plan B, promising nearby alternative</p>

  <p>Plan Z, the fall back option in case not even one start aligns itself
to work out for you!</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Summary</p>

    <p>So much english until now.</p>

    <p>In essence, we will not be able to predict what we can do . I think
what we can do is prepare. Prepare as in, know what type of engineers
the world needs, and then become one of them based on personal fit and
career capital, and excel at it.</p>

    <p>For example, we could found companies that help people ( direct
work). Definitely something to prep for. We could become top
management officials/ management consultants who earn like hell and
give it away ( earning to give). The thing I don‚Äôt know reliably is if
things would work out the way I want. Hell I can‚Äôt even predict which
of those will create the most impact mainly due to the million
uncertainities inbetween. But I know I can start somewhere, in a
‚Äúfuture proof‚Äù career trajectory, such that with some effort based on
my later  ‚Äúbetter‚Äù understanding of my capabilites and the worlds
necessities, I could just move to the place that needs me the most,
where I can contribute the most. Note that such a career should be
flexible, like a marketting job for example ( i.e., every company needs
this).</p>

    <p>Flexible- useful in many different types of jobs, and likely to remain
useful in the future. Such would be the type of job that we want to be in!</p>

    <p>First I wanted to summarize things, and now we proceed further with
evaluating options by looking at career paths of certain people!</p>

<p>David Goldberg started the ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs forum for good‚Äù.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance (from a philosophy degree) in the US, started
and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
in California. - David Goldberg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without a clear idea of what I want to do or what I could be doing, I
see myself in the blind. I am really uncertain about what I could be
doing, I don‚Äôt know if I should just choose something, or how to go
about it.</p>

<p>In other words, when I want to compare things, I don‚Äôt understand what
exactly to look for. What is good skill, what is good connection and
for what is something a good connection etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p>So I want to roughly say, I want flexible career capital. By that I
mean I should be able to jump to something bigger and better when the
time arises. I see roughly a couple of ways this is going down.</p>

<p>3 Concrete ways I think I might actually contribute to society in the
long run (estimated personal fit):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Earn to give in data science / Management consulting / programming</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working as a researcher at GiveWell, looking at data and
determining which place needs funding and how effective they are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having the ability to found companies that can cause much bigger
impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manage a business or start something that can make millions or is
useful to a large number of people</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="looking-into-possible-options-from-a-high-level">Looking into possible options from a high level<a id="sec-1-2" name="sec-1-2"></a></h2>

<p>Goal is to come up with better understanding comparing different
options across parameters with solid arguments and some clear conclusion.</p>

<p>So the parameters are:</p>

<h3 id="todo-uncertinity-in-knowing-how-my-current-job-fares-in-terms-of-learning-and-gaining-career-capital">TODO Uncertinity in knowing how my current job fares in terms of learning and gaining career capital<a id="sec-1-2-1" name="sec-1-2-1"></a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Flexible-career-capital</p>

    <p>Something that is future proof and something that allows me to
change to different types of jobs is the definition of career
capital. For example, you don‚Äôt want to do something real specific,
like know exactly how to train a komodo dragon of age 3. You need
to be flexbile in the sense, have a wide scope to be useful in
various scenarios and move as we have more information ( be able to
train all dragons for example). We need to be able to build on our
previous knowledge and not start afresh every single time. It‚Äôs
time and skill we spent there. For example, Tara went on to be a
pharmacist in the red cross. Despite realizing that she can do
better elsewhere, she does not have the skills to move. This is
what you want to avoid.</p>

    <p>With <strong>Design engineering in NL</strong>, I am not sure how transferable the
skills learnt here are. Yes I work on problem solving in the
precision industry. But I don‚Äôt know how I will fare in the
automotive industry for example. Going to an engineering
consultancy might help gain flexible career capital. As consultants
typically work 1 year to 6 months in a field and move to another
project.</p>

    <p>It might help me climb the stages say as a design leader and go
into management or team leading, but I am not sure what the scene
is. Specifically, I am not sure if it will make enough money as you
get promotions. What I do is creative, and I suspect my job cannot
be AI‚Äôd. If mine can be AIed, then data science should also be, but
I don‚Äôt see any alarms caused there within the website.</p>

    <p>In summary, Engineering as I do seems AI unreplacable for now, I am
not sure how to quantify or qualify the career capital obtained
through this. Although I can say that with my current job, it feels
like very little is going on somedays. Either change jobs to much more
learning and better peers! Need to write a little about it, before
I conclude. I am not here to complain.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Science, Management, finance, marketting and programming</strong> is
considered as flexible career capital as every company needs them
and is and will be in great demand. hat will be relevant in many
different jobs in the future as technology changes. This prevents
you from getting stuck in a dead end, especially early in your
career.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skills that you gain:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programming, statistics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personal productivity, problem-solving</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decision making, social skills and management</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Statistics and forms of data science and being good with numbers and
problem solving seem to be part of finance, management consulting,
programming and data science.</p>

<p>As things are slow at my job as a design engineer, although from time
to time I do problem solving, I dont think I will end up with any proper
acheivements or skills, so Moving is impoeritive.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connections that you will make</li>
</ol>

<p>I don‚Äôt really know much about this. Anyways, I have heard stories of
management consultants knowing big people, also data scientists. My
job, well, not much as I have here first hand.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Runway</p>

    <p>Hypothesis: Doing engineering will not get me crazy runway</p>

    <p>Evidence: This is the money that I will be able to save in case I
get laid off or need to try something else. Also money I can give
falls in this category. For the sake of convinience, we will just
talk about money earned and money saved as our key indicators.</p>

    <p>My data science friend working in apple earns about 150k $ just by
himself after 2 years of work + a killer masters, with madass
bonusses. My brother an antenna design engineer in Nvidia, probably
does something similar after 5 years of experience. My friend in
somewhat a similar field as I (mechanical engineering;
troubleshooting etc‚Ä¶) earns about 95k. All the above are in the
same region.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Hypothesis: Working in Holland probably never gets any better</p>

<p>Evidence:As a hollander working for the last year, I suspect the
way of work throughout is about 8 hrs/day and nothing more. Their
whole lifestyle is relaxed. For example, I have 40 motherfucking
days of paid vacation. The only case I have heard of life being
fast paced, long-hours, crazy money ( like the US), is with
investment banking. This makes sense, the job demands that. The
normal folk people get paid not as much as US, get many holidays
and get work 8 hrs and done. My colleague who is a very good
electrical engineer gets paid a meer 52k Euros with 20 years of
experience. My special ‚Äúperformance bonus‚Äù was 700 Euros. I can‚Äôt
imagine someone with mech engineering in my company with similar
years of experience, gets much more. The increase in salaries are
at max 5% (translates to &lt;500 Euros a years, i.e., 50 euros a
month) Kill me! Although I am in a startup, this one is modestly
funded. Maybe the situation is much better when I join say ASML a
leading lithographer.</p>

<p>Talking about saving, my current saving with participating in
limited sort of activities could be 14k euros. My saving could increase
to ~22k euros conservatively saying. My peer in US can save about say
35k $ (28k Euros), 6k is nothing short of awesome. And I suspect
his pay increases are more than that we have here, along with
growth.</p>

<p>To me it looks like working in holland based on runway never gets
better. But it is rather easy to get a citizenship. This would me
for a great plan Z. I could try everything I want and fail and pick
up myself in Holland.</p>

<p>Hypothesis: CS engineers, Data scientists, create more value for
the company and hence get more money. These people also do a lot of
problem solving.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Personal fit</p>

    <p>To me the easiest thing to move to would be DS, as it involves
little programming and some problem solving. Traineeships are
around the corner. I could prep for free online, or if I am cray, I
could take a bootcamp in UK. Wow! Moving certainly would start from
netherlands and slowly move to the US say after joining Google
here.</p>

    <p>Management consultancy is right off the charts something that I am
currently not cut out for. There was a Shell traineeship, which I
felt I might not be suited for (read as ‚ÄúHard‚Äù) right from the
beginning ( well my worry is mainly about quantitative reasoning in
break neck speeds.). I am young and thriving and I suspect I can
pull my shit up and prep for it if thats what it takes, and go into
some form of management after which I can migrate to a consultancy?
Cause right now I am just an engineer. Mckinsey doesn‚Äôt want to
hire this Nigga! I want to work my ass off in my prime and kill
it. Learn a lot, be pushed beyond things. I suspect I can always
pick up from where I left and get back to engineering if I suck.</p>

    <p>Investment banking could be the hardest, from a skillset point of
view. Right now to get into it, I don‚Äôt know anyway, other than
doing a proper degree. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll fare. I am ready to
put in the hours and be good at it. It‚Äôs ok to fail. The money is
crazy, I want a part of that. Maybe somehow get into finance of
sorts and from there, move to other avenues. If not now when!</p>

    <p>Design engineering is pretty much what I can get into, I fit in
pretty well. With some years of experience I should be quite
good. Although with my current job, I am more like doing problem
solving for the precision industry. Thinking of ways to come up
with solutions is mostly what I do nowadays. I think I am slow,
that things take a long while to get done, but I don‚Äôt hear that
feedback from my leader yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Impact</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>will be based on career capital, Runway. Right now I am not looking at
what will be the exact impact. I will take rough rules of thumb as
prescribed by 80k hrs. The <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/">website</a> already informed me that Management
consultancy would be my best option to create impact.</p>

<p>This is what I want to be like, I would like to move to interesting
and hard problems solve them. I want to be as good as possible with my
job. Be an acheiver, just like the other souls interviewed by
80k-hours-website.</p>

<p>My career could look something like this‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance (from a philosophy degree) in the US, started
and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
in California.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The profiles of people on the website are nothing short of
exceptional. That‚Äôs what I want to be, and hopefully that creates a
lot of impact. Maximize success, be really good at what I do. Donate
as much as possible and jump to opportunities to lead,
With more time and more knowledge I should be able to choose and move
up like the guy above.</p>

<ol>
  <li>how to get there? ability to get there, some career paths?</li>
</ol>

<p>For <strong>Design Engineering</strong>, maybe there is a scope in the future to
startup once I am very good with what I do, maybe become CTO material
and then make good money, just like doing a business. But the
probabilities of that happening are low, I feel if I stick to this
job. I will become a Design leader but then there are several people
in line I have to beat to get to that position within a company. I
just want a role where I provide direction and allow people to work it
out. I just want to push for change in the way I see fit. Even more
rare is the company you startup actually going to be directly
impactful. So my point is yeah, I am already there. To get to US, I
could try to apply to US first and see, or move to some other bigger
company like ASML, and move within the company after good performance
over some years.</p>

<p>For <strong>Management Consulting</strong> I think I can get in, in 2 ways. Popular
opinion on <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/">80k-hours-website</a> is that one has to be part of the
Mckinsey, BCG and BAin. So assuming that I have to be there only, I
could do</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>MBA</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>part-time MBA</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Management traineeship at shell followed by attempting to apply to
Mckinsey with a killer profile.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For <strong>investment banking</strong> I could possibly do</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an economics masters in NL</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>or do some basic courses and try to get an internship and see where
that takes you, within a company.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For <strong>data science</strong> I see the following</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>start a traineeship ( apply and get selected of course)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>join a company in a starting position in Netherlands.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn enough DS online for 6 months and then look to appllying in
the US</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apply for a masters</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For <strong>Programming</strong> I guess I would, start picking up programming skills
and try to hit google nl in 2 years and from there try to move to the
US. I am not really keen on doing programming but Data science is more
something I am in for. DS has both problem solving and little data
science. Something I can migrate to almost now.</p>

<p>For <strong>business</strong> I will see how my friend is faring with his startup in
Holland and then maybe look for some options here. He told me has
contacts, but nothing materialized. Anyways it still seems farfetched,
that I would start running a huge company. I could run companies for
people and become big like that, but what we are talking about seems
far-fetched. I had several freinds saying in air that I could work
with them, but in reality they themselves were struggling. I don‚Äôt see
an opportunity that would allow me to gain experience and go on from
there. I wouldn‚Äôt know what a career like that looks like. I don‚Äôt see
options, and I don‚Äôt see any value in giving up my current job and
trying something like this. A store manager I am not sure what it
would constitute to in a resume to what all I want to become in the
future. I want to make money, and shit loads of it. Get it, not be a
store manger!</p>

<p>Going to Dubai for the money, could be a good plan A, but without
planZ it is useless. I see all sorts of options opening up with an
MBA.</p>

<p>Next week I will write more about specific ways I can do things, with
the costs etc.. that it would take to actually do things like that.
And the week after I think I should just go for decision making.</p>

<p>Meanwhile tomorrow I want to make sure I have written enough and
produce some TODO‚Äôs. It‚Äôs going to be painful! right o right o</p>

<p>This would mean somehow build my profile in DS before applying or?
just apply?</p>

<h2 id="making-a-big-list-of-options">Making a big list of options.<a id="sec-1-4" name="sec-1-4"></a></h2>

<p>Right now the problems I work would just allow me the ability to
earn-to-give and allow me career capital with which I should be able
to be bigger things.</p>

<p>Bigger things would look like this:</p>

<p>He started the ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs forum for good‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance (from a philosophy degree) in the US, started
and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
in California.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Management, finance, marketting and sales seems to surely have its benifits</p>

<h3 id="design-engineering-mechanical-engineering-in-netherlands">Design engineering/ Mechanical engineering in Netherlands<a id="sec-1-4-1" name="sec-1-4-1"></a></h3>

<p>I suspect engineering does not have much scope for me either with
earning-to-give or building-career-capital that is transferable and
felxible (useful in many different jobs and future proof).</p>

<p>The first thing that the interviewer at ASML told me is that if I am
looking at this job, then I am already aware that money is not going
to be big. I suspect he was talking about the career growth etc‚Ä¶ A
job in Shell (Management traineeship) could go all the way to 100 k
euros in 5 years within the same company. As an engineer, with the
bonus that we usually get withing 5 years, I cannot expect that growth.</p>

<p>It appears that there are other careers in other regions that should
allow me to earn much more than what I do now. I am young and
thriving, ready for some crazy hard ass challenges, ready to work long
hours if there is enough career capital on the plate.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Flexible-career-capital</li>
</ol>

<p>I work in the precision industry as a design/mechanical engineer. Job
is prmarily about problem solving and learning different
things. Involves a lot of shit, like having to deal with low-level
work. Lots of things bogging you down like shit, like having to deal
with HDF5 files and looking at them manually, copying time stamps to
determine where I need to be.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lots of low-level work needs to be done, way of work sucks to get to the cream of</li>
</ul>

<p>problem solving.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Way of work sucks, slow, and unmotivating for a decent part.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although can‚Äôt rememeber feeling like I want to kill myself or feeling
that I have to go to work. It seems natural. Challenges are in plenty.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Still can be challenging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skills that you gain,</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Decent problem solving skills, but need to move through quite some
low-level work. I am right now going into a clean room and doing
clamps and taking pictures. Not sure if it gets better say in data
science, where data always needs to be cleaned up.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connections that you will make</li>
</ol>

<p>Well nothing great except the CEO of the company. Colleagues are laid
back, clock 7.5 hours on an 8 hr work day. Not good for morale. DL is
really good, asks the right questions. This job might lead to a better
job but well,</p>

<p>Probably not the best people to surround with as they are laid back, I
guess because I am in R&amp;D. These people are not going to help me
spread ideas or are niether influential to help me out.</p>

<p>Some brainy people are here with whom I could collborate and work
with.</p>

<p>Thats it for now. I</p>
