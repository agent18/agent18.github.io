<p><strong>Dutch PR</strong></p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item">
    <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />You have been living in the Netherlands for 5 years or more with a valid residence permit.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="task-list-item">
    <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />You have had an uninterrupted 5-year stay in the Netherlands
    before submitting the application. This means that in those 5
    years you have not stayed outside the Netherlands for 6 or
    more consecutive months, or 3 years in a row for 4 or more
    consecutive months.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I have not stayed outside the netherlands for 6 or more consecutive
months. I am quite confident I pass this requirement as I went to
Germany for 7months, but came in between twice for 2 weeks or so.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Pass civic integration</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Registered in the Gemente</li>
</ul>

<p>I should be fine for the other small things.</p>

<p>Again I am not sure if this 5 year period is inclusive of my 2 year
masters.(TBC)</p>
