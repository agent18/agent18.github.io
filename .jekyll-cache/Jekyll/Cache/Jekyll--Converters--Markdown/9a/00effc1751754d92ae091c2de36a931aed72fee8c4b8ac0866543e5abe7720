I"œ<p>Hi Thej,</p>

<p>Overall it looks good. I just have following points to add as
suggestions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the profile section, I would either remove the line saying ‚Äúwith
experience contributing python code to TU Munich Software‚Äù, or
would <strong>add more details to it as it is bit vague and too
broad</strong>. <strong>What kind of software are you talking about? what
contributions you had</strong>?, etc.</p>

    <p>python source code contributed, adding functionality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the project section, I would add more detail on the type of
projects <strong>(academic, commercial, competition, etc)</strong>, your role
(project lead, contributor, etc), and number of people involved if
any. (skip) (<strong>team work time management‚Ä¶</strong>) overcome challenge
in current field.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In NLP project, you optimized the <strong>loading computations speed of what</strong>? How
did you do it? ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù is a subjective term and could vary
depending upon the hardware you are using. It is better to add more
details, perhaps it is more useful to provide details on <strong>how you
achieve those improvements</strong>, via change in model architecture? or
<strong>via better software engineering methods</strong>?</p>

    <p>have some baseline‚Ä¶
computational overload computational runtime over</p>

    <p>over the baseline‚Ä¶. try‚Ä¶</p>

    <p>Implementation for image classifi</p>

    <p>designed the NLP algorithm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do you mean by ‚ÄúBuild an image classifier/ NLP model‚Äù? Did you
design a network architecture, or <strong>did you implement an existing
architecture?</strong> It is better to be more specific.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accuracy number (<strong>90%</strong>, 24%) don‚Äôt mean much on their own. Though it
is fine if you want to include them. It would perhaps be better if
you can <strong>compare</strong> your accuracy numbers to existing numbers by
state-of-the-art methods, if available. Or <strong>provide details on what
do these number represents</strong>? for example, your company has a model
in production with baseline accuracy of 20% and you achieved x%
improvement by developing model with 24% accuracy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would use more professional term like an expert rather than
‚ÄúGo-to-guy for ‚Ä¶‚Äù. sub-pixel registration‚Ä¶</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least to me this line is not self explanatory: ‚ÄúUsed statistics
to identify uncertainties with minimum measurements.‚Äù Perhaps add
more details to ‚Äúminimum measures‚Äù.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Äúlots of linear algebra ‚Äú How do you define ‚Äúlots‚Äù. It is very
subjective, be more precise.</p>

    <p>more heavy linear algebra which included‚Ä¶.<br />
(model order reduction, basis, reduced basis projections etc)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúWrote code to optimize the topology of a 2D structure in MATLAB. ‚Äú
Your contribution in terms of ‚Äúwriting code‚Äù is not very
clear. Perhaps use some more precise, like designed/improved an
algorithm, etc‚Ä¶ implemented an algorthm .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúSaved 300 man hours and ‚Ç¨20K in place of an already chosen
concept at Mapper Lithography. ‚ÄúHow? Perhaps list your
contributions.</p>

    <p>reduce budget‚Ä¶ saved significant amount‚Ä¶</p>

    <p>(such as going beyond and asking for clarification on the
requirements, and looking for other simpler solutions than the one
that I was supposed to investigate)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would include the contact information of the recommends.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>add email if necessary linkedin‚Ä¶.</p>

<p>(If they want, I think they need to check with me‚Ä¶)</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions regarding these points. Also
attaching my CV.</p>
