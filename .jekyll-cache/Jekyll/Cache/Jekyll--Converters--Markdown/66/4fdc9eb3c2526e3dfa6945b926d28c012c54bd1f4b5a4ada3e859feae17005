  <p>What about everything

What about animals?
(What about it?)
Turned kingdoms to dust
(What about us?)
What about elephants?
(What about us?)
Have we lost their trust?
(What about us?)
What about crying whales
(What about us?)
Ravaging the seas?
(What about us?)
What about forest trails?
(Ooh)

What about the common man?
(What about us?)
Canâ€™t we set him free?
(What about us?)
What about children dying?
(What about us?)
Canâ€™t you hear them cry?
(What about us?)
Where did we go wrong?
(Ooh)
Someone tell me why
(What about us?)
What about baby boy?
(What about it?)
What about the days?
(What about us?)
What about all their joy?
(What about us?)
What about the man?
(What about us?)
What about the crying man?
(What about us?)
What about Abraham?
(What about us?)
What about death again?
(Ooh)
Do we give a damn?
