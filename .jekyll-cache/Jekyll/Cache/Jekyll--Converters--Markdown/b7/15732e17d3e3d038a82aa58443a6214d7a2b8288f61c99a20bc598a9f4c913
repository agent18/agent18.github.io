<h3 id="solving-it">Solving it</h3>

<p>I think I have a few more hours to decide if something will work or
not. There seem to be options for hybernation, but ultimately I would
like something that I can suspend and move from one place to
another. I think the current sleep capability is definitely a few
hours(3-6 hrs).</p>

<p>Inability to sleep more than 5 hrs lets say.</p>

<p>So I always work at home, sometimes I have to take my laptop
somewhere, very rarely, say when I am going to india, when I am going
to a tax consultant, thats when I would need the laptop alive with the
necessary docs opened. In the worst case I can check how hibernation
works.</p>

<p>Also a quick look at hibernation, shows problems associated with
it. Of course everything has problems with ubuntu, but also solutions!</p>

<p>Getting stuck due to opening of a couple of tabs on the
machine. Although it is chrome that I opened today morning, it was
clear that there were these memory hogging sites and they really took
away my ram to the point of getting things stuck. Going for a higher
ram seems slightly future proof as well.</p>

<h4 id="worries">Worries</h4>

<p>2 questions wihtout marked answers on stack for ubuntu 16.</p>

<p>For when I need it to be reliable for more than 1 day?</p>

<p>how often does that happen?</p>

<p>Fucking up the battery by keeping it on for ever?</p>

<p>Hybernation slow? not the same as suspend?</p>

<p>Ideally I would liek something that I can close and open at will, and
not have to worry about reducing the battery life (estimated at 50
Euros/piece). The life of this Laptop @ max is expected to be 2 years,
but it runs amazingly now. Software centre opens in no fucking time
at all. Shocking.</p>

<p>The life of a battery is about 500 recharges after which it reduces in
capability, (~2 years). I remember for my HP laptop I did buy a new
battery 3 years after living. I used the fuck out of the battery,
always kept it in charge etc.. I canâ€™t remember when I actually lost
control of the battery. But I use that laptop for everything.</p>

<p>Worst case:</p>

<p>Assuming a laptop lasts for 6 years, 100 bucks for life after 6 years,
adn 50 bucks every 2 years, these are the numbers I see.</p>

<p>With the Dell Latitude E5430, I would have costs of 850 over 8 years
and with 1000 with a new laptop over 8 years. The dell laptop with its
basic flaws such as inability to sleep in case I ever need it.</p>

<p>I can return the laptop within the next 2 days, it sure appears that
the inability to sleep might be a very small inconvinience</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>It appears that if I invest 700 for a new laptop it might still make
sense in the long run.</p>
