I"è<p>Earlier in the essay series on career <a href="/career.html">here</a>, we discussed about financial contingency, physical health and other things we might be interested in considering, for a long life of giving what we can. In the <a href="/career(2).html">next post</a> we go into details of what a good job should have. Essentially we would like a job that gives us flow (we work on something that we are good at), good money or impact, and moderate stress levels on short-term. It was attempted to also debunk the myths or the fear behind having any stress at all. Moving on through the blessing of <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-much-difference-can-one-person-make/">80k-hrs</a>, we continue through their series.</p>
