I"Ô<p>In the year of 2014 my friend x-co-conspirator STM, wrote [this article] on his blog. I remember thinking then that it was an amazing article. Till date I find myself quoting things from this post to my friends. I have often found myself unable to decide what my action should be for a particular situation. Although I expected this article to help me, I found myself not sure sometimes of what action I should take. But sometimes I hope I did what was needed.</p>
