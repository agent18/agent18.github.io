<p>In <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/break-cryonics-down.html">this post</a> blog post, Robin Hanson explains something interesting about probabilities. I try to explain his points as they seem to make sense to me. I will not at the beginning of each sentence say, â€œRobin said in his post thatâ€, instead Iâ€™ll make it my narrative. But for all practical reasons, please assume if they are good that it was Robins point.</p>
