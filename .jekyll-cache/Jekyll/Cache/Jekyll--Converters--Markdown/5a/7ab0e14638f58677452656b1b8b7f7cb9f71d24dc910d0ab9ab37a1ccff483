<p>Opportunities to learn seem boundless, be it free or paid. Estimated
learning time before starting in a company is about 3 months
(full-time conservative?). Money is lot better than what I am doing
now. Allows some scope for direct working. It looks like this could be
an option if earning-to-give is not really the primary option,
although I suspect I should be able to do 50k$/ year within the next
10 years if I am at the top tech firms. Personal fit wise, this
appears to be the closest to what I can migrate to work wise.</p>

<h1 id="diving-into-the-details">Diving into the details</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Skills obtainable: Problem-solving, programming, large
data-analysis, statistics all of which are transferable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Connections: No idea. But my friend in DS who worked in MuSigma
India, now in Apple seems to have worked with big-shots. If direct
work is my goal, I should network with the right people, say within
80k hours team.  But to reach them I need to be a high achiever. In
other words, connections are good, nothing out of the normal.</p>

    <p>I suspect it would be possible to meet the best people at the best
places, like Google, Facebook, or in start-ups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Credentials: The impression I get based on what <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/#what-is-this-career-path">80k hours DS
profile</a> says, is that the success is tangible, although
not as crystal clear as in marketing/sales. So basically, it should
be possible to explain to future employers based on my progress and
level of problems solved and achievements and $ saved/made for an
organization.</p>

    <p>At my current job as a design engineer, I canâ€™t really boast of
crazy achievements for a future employer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Runway: Actually I am not sure what I am expected to do with this. I
will always have enough runway for 12-18 months. Salary wise it is
expected for a graduate in the US to be paid ~ 100k $. In Holland if
it is a large company I will be paid 46k Euros at start and ~40k
Euros if it is smaller company as I will be a fresher. Growth from
there on is not sure, but I would like to migrate to the big
companies and slowly find myself in the US in the real valley.</p>

    <p>This is decent paying job. I should have enough runway and more to
give, than what I am doing now, but say after 2 years. I suspect I
need to clock a few years before I can ask for the big buck. Also
experience would count then.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="best-ways-to-gain-career-capital-for-ds">Best ways to gain career capital for DS</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Working in reputed organizations: Should be possible. Everyone is
interested in DS nowadays. Even flight companies. Maybe in the start
it is possible to work already with the big ones. But to go to
Google and others I suspect it takes a few years ( at least 2 years
to gain some solid experience)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quantitative graduate studies: Masters in the US/Holland/Germany in
DS is an option, this way I can get to go to US. Either do studies
in stats or pure DS as my friend in apple would suggest.</p>

    <p>Only problem is I am not sure I can fund my own education and be at
the risk of not getting paid for 2 years followed by not getting a
job. Would be ideal way to go to US but the shot is not for sure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Valuable transferable skill: Yes I will know more about programming,
and will get better at problem solving, statistics. These
appear to be transferable to other jobs. It is predicted that
the market grows in size by 18% from 2010 to 2020. Not sure what
that means, but the fact that 80k hours says it, informs me that it
is worth investing in it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking opportunities which allow you to achieve impressive and
socially valuable things:</p>

    <p>Possibly within the top tech firms or with NGOâ€™s such as Center for
Disease Control, Google, Khan Academy, Bayes Impact and DataKind</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General: Reasonable working conditions (40-50 hrs in US),
Intellectually satisfying.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item">
    <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Speak to people who are in DS in Netherlands and how they got

    <p><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Write part 2</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>P.S</p>

<p>Spent 1.5 hrs writing and reading and re-editing max with more than
1.5 hrs of break in between. Horrible. Rushed to finish the essay due
to mass procrastination.</p>
