I"~<p>From September 5th until December 1st I had been training almost 5
times a week, including cardio of 20 mins and lifting weights. I fell
sick for a week and then left to India for about 5 weeks. I was sick
here on and off (acidity, food poisoning, lot of drinking, fried food,
sleepless nights etcâ€¦). I still did manage to workout ~2 times a
week amidst all the struggles.</p>
