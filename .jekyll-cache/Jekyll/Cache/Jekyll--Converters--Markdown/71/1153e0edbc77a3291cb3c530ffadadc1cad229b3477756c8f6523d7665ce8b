<p>This is a predicate based on his beliefs about what is right and
wrong, not on empirical examples. “Crime does not pay” is a predicate
about the world and it would be false if the average crime led to a
lot of money without imprisonment. “Crime should not pay” can be
skipped for now. (“The Holy B says that crime should not pay” is
testable, though.)</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Checks out.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist</strong>: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
<em>a-is-important</em>; <em>unsure</em>; (I am not unsure anymore, this is how far I
can go with checking definitions like “important”)</p>

<p><strong>plan</strong>: check with an STM (no need to practice)</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: What ever is needed for [15], I am [16]</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: The things needed for my career</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: I am ready to do.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Plotting my path to the US is needed for my career.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: I have not really spoken to anyone within ASML about
opportunities to go to the US. I have heard stories about it. Looks
like example doesn’t match the definition.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist</strong>: yes; false; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
<em>matching-definition</em>; <em>unsure</em>; <em>time</em>  (You need to understand that
these are vague predicates I guess)</p>

<p><strong>Pattern</strong>: “What is needed for X I am ready to do”</p>

<p>I wont take this seriously. This statement is but an exercise and that
is it. I wrote it in the past and whether it is true or not doesn’t
make a difference to me.</p>

<p><strong>plan</strong>: Skip it.</p>

  <p>Part of the way (mass incarceration persists in this country)[1] is by

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [1] is by [2].</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: What we do.</p>

that he can pay for things related to his case such as a private

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [1] cannot be [2].</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: Discussion amongst Democrats</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: cannot be intellectual</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Very vague labels and hard to give examples for this</em></p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: I have [11].</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: need focus.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: I have spent roughly 500 hrs over one year on Concrete
thinking and still struggle with ten phrases an hour.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: It appears that ten phrases per hour is really slow
and that I need to spend more effort on it to improve.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist</strong>: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;

  <p>Claims: Getting married is [12].</p>

  <p>Subject: Being Married</p>

  <p>Predicate: is [12].</p>

  <p>Example: The great Eliezer Yudkowsky, Paul Graham, Bill Gates,
Vishwanath Anand are all married.</p>

  <p>Here I should have compared for example what Eliezer is and would have
been if he was not married or sumpin in that context. But I didn’t</p>

<p>What it actually should have been:</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: What marriage will do to your goals</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: bring it down</p>

<p>Then I would give an example to the subject and not just say
“Eliezer or Vishvanath Anand”.</p>

<p><strong>how-to</strong>: Getting A is B;</p>
