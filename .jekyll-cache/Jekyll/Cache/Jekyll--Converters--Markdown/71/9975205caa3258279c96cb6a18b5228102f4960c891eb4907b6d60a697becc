<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A <a href="/deliberate-practice.html">summary of the book</a> “Talent is Overrated” was written in
September 2019. The crux of the book is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is path that exists, that runs between your current abilities
to that of the greats. It is hard, extremely long and demanding. Not
many will follow it all the way till the end. But if you do…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote
yourself to an ideal, and if they (1st world) can’t stop you, then
you become something else entirely… Which is … Legend Mr Wayne!</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Laszlo Polgar, a Hungarian Educational Psycologist, married a woman
with the understanding that he would have children with her and on
whom he would conduct an experiment. The experiment being, to test his
claim that “He could nurture Talent into his kids”. He had 3 children,
he chose chess as the space where he was going to train his children
as it had a lot of material on it, and it was “relatively easy to
measure” progress (said some people).</p>

<p>All 3 of his daughters were home-schooled. They practiced “hours and
hours” of it everyday. At the age of 17, Susan was the first woman to
qualify for what was called the Men’s World Championship. All three at
ages 19,14 and 12 respectively, competed in a Women’s Olympiad and
scored Hungary’s first-ever victory against the Soviets, becoming
national heroes.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of an STM I later went on to use the <a href="/Deliberate-Practice-case-study.html">Benjamin
Franklin Method</a> and did a couple of practice sessions. With this
post we discuss, What DP looks like, how to do DP, and also
investigate the past DP attempts.</p>

<h2 id="characteristics-of-dp">Characteristics of DP</h2>

<p>There are 5 characteristics of DP, the kind that leads to Greatness
given by the acronym <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DRFMF</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Designed</strong> specifically to improve performance</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Tiger Woods has been seen to drop golf balls into a sand trap
and step on them, then practice shots from that near-impossible
lie.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Here Tiger, is trying to improve his performance, for the 2-3
  shots that happen in the season, where the ball is in sand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be <strong>repeated</strong> a lot.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Ted Williams, baseball’s greatest hitter, would practice hit-
ting until his hands bled.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Feedback</strong> on results is continuously available</p>

    <p>When practicing shooting the ball from the free-throw line, we can
  measure how many balls went in, how many balls went in without
  touching the ring, how many balls hit the right side of the ring,
  etc… So constantly, we are able to look at performance, for
  example, percentage of shots made without touching the ring etc…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is highly demanding <strong>mentally</strong></p>

    <p>A Berlin Study of the best violinists reported practice of 3.5
  hours in 2-3 sessions, roughly 1.5 hrs at a time. And other top
  musicians report 4-5 hours as an upper limit of DP that can be
  done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It isn’t much <strong>fun</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A few moments with a calculator tell us that by an extremely
conservative estimate, Arakawa’s road to the gold medal
involved at least twenty thousand derriere impacts on an
unforgiving surface.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There’s nothing enjoyable about running to the point of
exhaustion or lifting weights to the point of muscle
failure. But these were centrally important activities.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>On the days when I do Biceps, I need to do 9 supersets of 3
  exercises each. Somehow each superset has something related to the
  Bicep (either a dumbell or barbell curl). I am trying to lift the
  max possible weights with each set. By the end of the first
  superset, when I am at the 5th rep of curling a 10kg dumbbell, I
  want to tap out, and having to go 8 more supersets is just so
  painful mentally. I keep looking at how far the end is constantly
  to motivate myself to just finish it at max intensity.</p>

    <p>It’s not fun!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="measuring-and-improving-performance">Measuring and improving performance</h2>

<p>Say there is a quiz with 10 different types of questions such as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2x2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2x79</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">25x79</code> etc… the number of digits increasing with
each question. Let’s say I got right, the first 3 questions out
of 10. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2x2</code> aka single digit multiplication is very easy and I can do
at the back of my head without paper. For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2x79</code> it will take some
more time but I should still be able to manage single digit multiplied
by 2 digits. But further than that, it seems like it will take more
time and I might make mistakes as well.</p>

<p>Working on single digit multiplication doesn’t seem to improve my
score, at best, it will keep my score where it is. Where as working on
double digits and triple digit multiplication seems to give the
possibility to improve score.</p>

<p>So the next time I do the test again, say I score 6/10. In that case
it appears that I have improved my performance and that there is still
scope to improve in the places where I failed, aka, higher digits
multiplication. I should continue to do two things, maintain the score
for multiplication questions 1-6 and then focus on improving 7-10.</p>

  <p>A study of figure skaters found that sub-elite skaters spent lots of
time working on the jumps they could already do, while skaters at
the highest levels spent more time on the jumps they couldn’t do,
the kind that ultimately win Olympic medals and that involve lots of
falling down before they’re mastered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tiger Woods, one the greatest golfers of all time, is known to work on
his failures. Golfers typically face a ball buried in sand only 2 or 3
times a season. Yet, Tiger Woods is known to step on the ball in the
sand and practice these shots (which are a near impossible lie).</p>

<h2 id="what-i-am-doing-currently">What I am doing currently</h2>

<p>Recently, I have been working on DP of this thing called “concrete
thinking”. For this the goal is to identify claims and come up with
one example for those claims. For example:</p>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> People in Venezuela are desperate for food</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYxL-n5xSRI">This video</a> shows examples of how people are rummaging through
garbage for food.</p>

<p>Am I improving? Frankly, I don’t know if I am improving. Up until
yesterday, I don’t think I knew how to measure my performance.</p>

<p><strong>Not sure if Designed to improve performance</strong></p>

<p>It appears that it is <strong>designed</strong> to improve the ability to check a
claim against atleast one example. I don’t know if it improved
performance.</p>

<p><strong>It is repeated a lot</strong>:</p>

<p>I have done 5-8 exercises amounting to about 200 hrs and 400 claims
(roughly).</p>

<p><strong>Feedback seems to be continuously available</strong></p>

<p>Initially I used the BF method where I look at a piece of text, make a
summary and later rewrite the text based on the notes. Then the work
is compared across dimensions such as “examples given, claims
identified” etc… We understand across how many dimensions we have
failed and that is our feedback. I would get feedback from an STM in
addition to this, within a week. My earlier practice is shown
<a href="/DP-CT-examples.html">here</a>. It shall be noted that NO ACTION was forcefully taken to
apply the feedback the next time I write.</p>

<p>In the last 5 exercises, the BF method was not used, instead the
claims were identified and it was attempted to give examples for these
claims. The feedback I got, appears to be primarily from my own
“feelings” or the “lack of confusion being clarified” of
something. For example, there was <a href="/DP-8-questions.html">this document</a> from my work,
which I didn’t “understand”, which I took apart using the above
process. This allowed me to have a conversation “on my boss’s level”
about the document. Furthermore, I looked at how many phrases I give
example for and keep track of that with every hour.</p>

<p>In addition to the “feedback” during the excercise, an STM gave his
feedback within a week. He pointed out many mistakes over each
session. I would read the feedback and start writing another 100
claims. I didn’t take effort to make sure I didn’t commit those
mistakes again. I remembered one or two suggestions he made such as
“when you give an example, a lay person must be able to say if I have
answered the claim”, and “tried to implement them”.</p>

<p>Over the feedback from the most recent article an STM pointed out that
I had been repeating the same errors and that I should keep a note of
it. <strong>To sum up, I get feedback, but I seem to be doing very little with
it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Works seems to be mentally challenging</strong></p>

<p>The work seems to be mentally challenging. Working on 6 hrs of DP per
day, took me &gt;9 hrs. It was quite a challenge to sustain concentration
for 1.5 hrs at a time.</p>

<p>To keep the challenge level high I look at “claims/phrases per hour”
written and force myself to meet something like “10 phrases per
hour”. But it has been very hard to meet it, as there are large
variances in the difficulty of text from one paragraph to the other,
from one article to another. For example, if I worked on
80khours article I usually gave examples for 5 phrases within an
hour. With articles I had written in my blog, it was easy to meet 10
claims per hr. And even within the 80khours article, there was
variances with me completing 2 to 7 claims every hr.</p>

<p><strong>It was not much fun.</strong></p>

<p>There are 1000 other things I’d rather be doing like sleeping watching
TV, going to the gym or hanging out with friends.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-plan-now">What is the plan now</h2>

<p>So far, we have seen that there are certain characteristics of DP
which I have been failing on meet. E.g., getting continuous feedback,
and designing to improve performance. We have also seen that we
measure claims per hour and leave out something as critical as
measuring the “true performance”. Furthermore, the greats seemed to have
focused on their mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we fall?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do we fall sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves
up. —Alfred J Pennyworth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Working on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2x2</code> doesn’t seem to help anything other than keep the
performance level the same. Whereas working on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">34x79</code>, seems to be
allowing to tackle new scenarios which will improve the above defined
performance.</p>

<p>So in my case, I should be identifying different scenarios where I
fail. For example (as was pointed in the last feedback round), I suck
when I am looking at claims in 80k articles, and trying to come up
with examples (<a href="/DP-feedback-key-ideas.html">as exposed here</a>) where I didn’t identify that the
claim (“There is no doubting the force of the arguments…”) was
empirically false.</p>

<p>Over the next 100 claims I work on, I should—with every
claim—identify what type it is. If it is something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2x2</code>, I
skip it. If it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">45x709</code> I will work on it. If it is something like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">infinity x infinity</code>, I will add it to the scenarios and work on
it. Overall in the end measure statistics of how many I got right in
each scenario that has been classified as “I will work on it”.</p>

<p>Another important aspect about this is where these claims originate
from. For example, this could be from my own life, 80khours article or
other discussions or presentations I make. They seem to be quite
different in its handling. Yesterday an STM said “Concrete Thinking
allows for understanding by seeing not the labels but an actual
example with it” and immediately I agreed with him. But I didn’t have
an example to go with that claim. The origin of the claims also seems
to be important and I should also take claims from different places,
not just 80khours.</p>

<p>Regarding “getting feedback continuously”, from the next time, I shall
be checking each claim and example, against a list of previously seen
mistakes and make sure I don’t make the same mistakes again. In
addition an STM will also overlook the work and give feedback.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In summary, there seems to be a new way of working aka doing DP, one
that seems to be measuring progress and one where we focus on our
failures.</p>

<p>We seem to only want to pick ourselves up when we fall.</p>
