<ol>
  <li><a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/highest-paying-jobs/">better pay</a>: Apparently 30% higher</li>
</ol>

<p>On average the people I know in the US are capable of saving ~30k$
despite doing things like traveling and spending money on gas and
other luxuries. I can save 15k on a good year and by working at the
multi-national companies. I suspect their bonuses and increase in
salaries are much higher than I have here in NL.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Cryonics: More scope for it in the US. Even in a developed country
like Netherlands, there is no cryonics facility. The closest there is
is I think in Russia. A lot of bad reviews about being flown to Russia
in time. Although it can be expected that it will soon pick up in
Europe, I am not sure it is guaranteed as it appears not much has
happened in the last few years.</p>

    <p>Better Opportunities:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>80k hours suggests to do a graduate degree in the US as
opposed to say UK, possibly for above reasons. This is the only
reliable information I have. Others are word of mouth, which I am not
sure can be taken seriously or can be used to make decisions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>English speaking, very important country in the world.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="where-us-sucks">Where US sucks?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Pension? retirement</li>
  <li>general hours of working?~ lack of work life balance</li>
  <li>Very few vacation days</li>
  <li>hire and fire policy</li>

## How to get to the  US


How many years does it take

## VISA's

Green card is the permanant residence card for people in the
US. Except voting you pretty much are able to do a lot of things.

**Green card through job**

**Green card after working with H1B for 15 years?**

Whats the deal
go to quora

My brother will be a citizen in 20 years from now (I will be 46 by then) tops,
in the US. It appears that this route is far-fetched but still an
option. From that time he can apply for my green card it will take
12-16 years before we get an interview (I will be 58 by then). I can
know more later. I doubt this changes things.
