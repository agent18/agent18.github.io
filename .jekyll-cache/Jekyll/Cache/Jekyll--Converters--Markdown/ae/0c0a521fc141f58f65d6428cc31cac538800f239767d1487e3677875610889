<p><strong>Definition</strong>: This claim is a little tricky I think. It makes it
sound as though Biden didn’t want busing which actually “desegregated
public schools”. I think Biden was against busing that CLAIMED to
desegregate public schools. So I think the claim is false as it
doesn’t match the definition of [6].</p>

<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>

<p>Can you please comment on the following as well.</p>

<h3 id="not-sure-if-something-is-a-running-example-atleast-8133-claims">Not sure if something is a running example (atleast 8/133 claims)</h3>

<p>Not sure if something is running or not? What is the definition. I
remember the DP example of talking about tiger woods and that’s it. In
the Kamala Harris Debate article what would be the running example?
When is it running and when is it not? I have below 2 examples.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Sen. Kamala Harris)[1] directly challenged (former Vice President Joe Biden)[2]
on (his recent comments on civil rights and segregationist lawmakers)[2a],
delivering (an impassioned critique)[3] that became (the signature exchange
of the second night of the first Democratic debate)[4].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [1] delivered [3].</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: What [1], said.</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: delivered [3].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: “I agree with you when you commit yourself to the
importance of finding common ground … [But] it was hurtful to hear
you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this
country.”</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: This seems to be impassioned critique, something
filled with great emotion and is also an “assessment”.</p>

<!-- Impassioned filled with great emotion -->

<!-- An Analysis or assesment of something -->

<p><strong>Checklist</strong>: yes; false; none; chapter; running; none</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>(The California senator)[1] began to press (Biden on his comments)[2]
about (working with conservative lawmakers)[3] who supported
(segregation based on race)[4], as well as (his past stance)[5] against
(busing to desegregate public schools)[6].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: Biden’s past stance was against [6].</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: Biden’s past stance.</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: Was against [6].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Biden said, “I have argued that the least effective way (to
desegregate public schools) is the busing remedy”—<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/30/politics/kfile-joe-biden-cnn-interview-busing-desegregate-schools/index.html">Source</a></p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: This claim is a little tricky I think. It makes it
sound as though Biden didn’t want busing which actually “desegregated
public schools”. I think Biden was against busing that CLAIMED to
desegregate public schools. So I think the claim is false as it
doesn’t match the definition of [6].</p>

<p><strong>Checklist</strong>: yes; false; none; not-chapter; not-sure-running; none</p>

<h3 id="when-do-things-have-or-dont-have-examples-12133-claims">When do things have or don’t have examples? (12/133 claims)</h3>

<p>Throughout the essay at many places in the essay I am unsure whether a
statement has examples or not. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is (no doubting)[0] the force of the arguments)[1] … (the problem)[2] is
(a research challenge worthy of the next generation’s best
mathematical talent)[3]. (Human civilisation)[4] is (at stake)[5].”  – Clive
Cookson, Science Editor at the Financial Times</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: [2] is [3].</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: [2].</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: is [3].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Solving the AI control problem</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: I don’t know what the predicate label is trying to say.</p>

<h3 id="hard-to-give-example-more-time-more-research-needed-39133-claims">Hard to give example, more time more research needed? (39/133 claims)</h3>

<p>What should I do in cases where it would take a lot of time to
research an example. It seems to be of less value to me to work on the
finding an example for the John Oliver video. Where as if this was
statistics, I should probably spend more time on it.</p>

<p><strong>Claims</strong>: The two US senators, (Eastland and Talmagde) built [2].</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: What Eastland and Talmagde did.</p>

<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: [2].</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: “I have no prejudice in my heart, but the white race is
the superior race and the Negro race an inferior race and the races
must be kept separate by law.” —<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Eastland">wiki</a></p>

check against [2].</p>

<p>We had already agreed to not go into “because” statements for now. The
following is an example with “means” (or implies). How are we to give
examples for this? or do we skip these as well?</p>

<blockquote>
