I"q<p>Right now I have a couple of things to do!</p>

<p>Find a house,</p>

<p>finishing the blog post,</p>

<p>do the course in Data science</p>

<p>writing resume in emacs latex setup and sending out applications.</p>

<h2 id="full-time-job">Full time job</h2>

<p>Finding a house is a full time thingy. I always need to keep thinking
about it. I need to infuse it with everything I do. I need to
everything I can and stop at anytime to get a house. The way of work
of sending out msgs at fixed hours might not work. I need to do
everything in my power to get this done. Dont stop at nothing. Ask
helena even.</p>

<p>finishing the blog post, I wanna get done with it. I should wrap it
up, identify the main points and then go ahead and publish it. And
suggest followups on it.</p>

<p>Course on Data Science should follow immediately. With every month you
are paying 40 Euros.</p>

<p>So I give myself 5 more days to finish the whole post. Start with
planning and then</p>

<p>In summary, blog post withing 5 days. including today ( weekends are
gonna be tight) . I have 25 hrs to work on it. before 11th!</p>

<p>Start by planning!</p>
