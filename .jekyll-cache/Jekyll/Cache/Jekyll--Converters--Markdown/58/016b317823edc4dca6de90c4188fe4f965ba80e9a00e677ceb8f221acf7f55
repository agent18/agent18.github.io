<p>Last week I didn’t really make any hard plan to write X words. Also, last week I didn’t really do any work regarding what career I should be choosing and my steps towards it. I majorly procrastinated away using Youtube, Facebook, work from office, and working out. I was either tired, or didn’t sleep well the previous day for useless reasons, or I had to do some homework for a course I was taking. Even if there is an excuse that sounds even remotely acceptable, the reader better note that not an ounce of work was done. Not one. My “work week” - including writing and my actual job- is from monday to friday. In the weekends I just do other things that I can’t do on the weekdays, like washing clothes, cooking batches, learning more about body building, researching products on Aliexpress, logging data of the week and of course procrastinating by wits out. As a log of my phone, I give how much time I spend on my phone yesterday (saturday). It was about 6.5 hrs, despite having the presssure to churn out 2.5k word article by today at 17 hrs. God help me!</p>
