  <p>+1 for fast.ai +1 for getting experience doing Kaggle competitions
But IMO don‚Äôt rush into deep learning and neglect the basic elements
of statistical learning

data scientist for five years and was entirely self-taught</p>

<p>I am considering doing some courses from Poverty Action Lab such as Data Science for Social Scientists, Microeconomics, and the challenges to Global Poverty. Is it a good place to start?‚Äù</p>

<p>Sounds good to me!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before you dive into ML! I‚Äôd say basic statistics and its relation
to daily life is very important.  Probability - know a few basic
distributions and real-life examples. Learn to intuitively classify
examples to the appropriate distribution.  Numeracy - Learn to focus
on the right quantities/outcomes for a problem.  Statistics - the
basics. False positives, false negatives, setting a threshold,
tradeoffs. Estimation, noise, fooled by randomness.  I also think
some data visualization skills are important. Specific packages
(matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh etc.) you can learn online - but for the
theory I highly recommend Tufte‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe visual display of
quantitative information‚Äù.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intro to ML: https://course18.fast.ai/ml<br />
Deep Learning for Coders: https://course.fast.ai/index.html<br />
For ML, nothing else compares, imo. Completely free with a big
community on the forums! You can learn pandas/numpy while doing
those courses as well (Start taking the course and look up stuff
about Pandas as it comes up). The 2020 version of Deep Learning for
Coders is coming online soon, so look out for that. I know that I‚Äôll
be taking it (again).</p>

<p>Example did coursera machine learning course after his phd in
computational stuff to get to a job in DS. Seems knowledgeable in
statistics after which Philips hired him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI employed advanced Statistical Mechanics concepts and modern Monte
Carlo techniques to simulate micro- and nano-meter size anisotropic
particles and elucidate their phase behavior as a function of various
macroscopic controllable parameters.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI lead the development of performance applications for our

learning to detect defects or optimize corrections.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAt the same time, those machines are operating in completely sealed

the chips, the way the customers operate our machines, is completely

<p>As Picnic is relatively small, and because we‚Äôre growing so fast ‚Äì
you‚Äôre given responsibility straight away. Two weeks after I started,
I was doing the order forecasts. That‚Äôs a lot of responsibility. Many
of our processes rely on the forecasting; the products we buy, the
shoppers and runners we plan for, the development of the fleet. In
order to write the forecasts, I used the existing models based on
historical data. By incorporating the number of orders already placed,
we saw real improvement in the model. The process is ongoing, and each
day we use new tools to develop more involved and accurate models.</p>

<p>Next to this, I‚Äôm also coordinating the Sunday delivery roll-out.</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>Other analysis I did (sent via email)</strong></p>

<p>Hi Tomai,</p>

<p>You had asked me earlier how I would do sanity checks to see whether a
code does what I expect it to. I don‚Äôt know why I panicked, but I
always do some sanity checks. For example, when I perform any
operation on my dataset I do the following basic checks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>test the operation on a very simple minimal dataset that I can
verify manually. This way I know the code works.</li>
  <li>Once I implement an operation on the actual large dataset, I test
it with 2 examples to make sure I see what I expect.</li>
  <li>I also check if the overall value make sense (Is the number in the
right order of magnitude? etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Hi Tomai and Jeroen,</p>

<p>You had asked if I have done something in between 1. basic statistics
and the 2. fraud detection assignment I have shown. Here is an example
troubleshooting assignment that I did at Mapper. Hope it is clear and
shows a bit about how I think.</p>

<p><strong>Situation</strong>:</p>

<p>Our ‚ÄúWafer Clamping module‚Äù (which consists of 10+ sub-modules) gets an
error message that we don‚Äôt have enough water to make the clamp. So
the clamp fails.</p>

<p>To give an idea of complexity of each module: Each module takes a day
to assemble and verify by one person.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been only 2 months since I started and I don‚Äôt know anything
about the module as I just started. I was expected to solve this,
nevertheless.</p>

<p><strong>Task</strong>: Identify the issue and convince the team lead of the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Action</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Basic sanity checks</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Is the water reservoir empty? <em>No</em></li>
      <li>Is the connection to the water reservoir shutoff by accident?
<em>No</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Is it a software implementation failure?</strong> Check the ‚Äúexpected
Clamp process‚Äù (e.g., which valve should open/close and when) and
the trace from the ‚ÄúWafer Clamping Station‚Äù to see if they are in
sync:</p>

    <p><em>Everything checks out.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Is there evidence that the clamp process even works on another
BUILD?</strong> Check if this Clamp process has been tested before on
another ‚ÄúWafer clamping module‚Äù:</p>

    <p><em>Yes it has.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What is the difference between the two traces?</strong> Check certain
‚Äúcritical features‚Äù (such as volume of water, volume of pressurized
nitrogen), which would impact water performance between the
‚ÄúWorking Wafer Clamp Module‚Äù and the ‚Äúnon-working Wafer clamp
module‚Äù.</p>

    <p><em>Start pressures are the same but the final pressures are quite
different.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do the two systems have the exact same HARDWARE?</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>I explain my findings to people who have experience with this
 system, and there I got a clue that perhaps I had a smaller
 ORIFICE in the ‚Äúnon-working Wafer Clamp Station‚Äù.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I start looking in the build sheets but I see no evidence of
 changes of the nozzle.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Did someone forget to update the buildsheet?</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>I wanted to test the ‚Äúdifferent Orifice‚Äù hypothesis,
non-invasively if possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Using ideal gas law and the traces of Pressures and Volumes from
both the ‚ÄúWafer Clamp Stations‚Äù, I was able to PREDICT THE EXACT
FINAL WATER LEVEL in the module in both cases accurately
provided I assumed the bigger orifice for one system and smaller
orifice for the ‚Äúnon-working wafer clamp station‚Äù.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Result</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This helped identify what type of orifice I had in the Non-working
Clamping Module</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once this was changed everything started working as expected.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Engineer D&amp;E for Overlay Wafer Fab Applications</p>

<p>Alignment group brings a lot of dater to you and you gain insights and
perform root cause analysis on it and communicate the results.</p>

<p>You are probably the most senior member in the team.</p>

<p>Mainly you will gain 
	- extract insights from dater
	- Not physiscs, more of respossibility thing
	- breakdown and understanding of different variations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Execute budget breakdown and root cause analysis</p>
  </li>

<p>NTP feasibility classic product development (samsung)</p>

<p>Jens: 45 people, 15 people in functional cluster architect, owns roadmap for
the Next 5 years, 2 years before cs apps, app, 10 years in ASML‚Ä¶
application overlay OPO, Canon and asml system, MTBI</p>

<p>David: FC architect, 2007, always OPO, Smash alignment, bsaseliner,
NTP and product development Belgium</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Why do you want to be part of this group? answer: started with
physics/data work and now moved to soft skills/data work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regression vs  correlation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ML why future</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why trust my</p>

    <p>How many volvo cars are there‚Ä¶ volvvo and teslas‚Ä¶ volvos, no one
 trusts ML.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>What sort of data do you work with?  Overlay data‚Ä¶ not eager to share
data are companies, but you ask logs, FAP info etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Escalations not many in NTP‚Ä¶ New node‚Ä¶ improvements‚Ä¶ , showing why you
don‚Äôt meet said claimed performance, showing the benefit of options,
how existing products can show benefit, New options can we come up
with it,</p>

<p>DSP projects do that‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Mapper, OPO‚Ä¶ David, why mapper , limited to actuators to change finger print
No reticle option, infinite
Correction capabilities
12 par + correct per field scnaner wasn‚Äôt fast enough‚Ä¶
Actuations 3rd order effects, lens‚Ä¶
Slightly manipulate lens system‚Ä¶ to get final result but for all fields.</p>

<p>What do you do in FC? Product development?  New estimaation models?
Finger print on wafer, 200 points of wafer, 38 par distortation 3800
parameters to define‚Ä¶ 300 points‚Ä¶ few points leading to projection on
an already existing space. And statistics‚Ä¶ often NTP‚Ä¶ customers don‚Äôt
want to share data, 5-6, Draw results from that‚Ä¶ estimation, EPE. He
said that the team sometimes needs people to draw CI with enough
points even though they have only 5-6 wafers info. Sometimes they have
to draw uncertainties of the 300 points over the 5-6 wafers and ‚Äúadd
the uncertainties‚Äù together.</p>

<p>Estimation models, developing new models. Dense data, 300,
mathematical descriptions Models whats there in it? All wafers must
work‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Physics, linear algebra, programming? Algorithm team focusses on
mathematics, Learning, shapes, data analysis, NTP projects‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Collect data for not able to  300 sampling‚Ä¶ 800 and 1000 points</p>

<p>What is life cycle? 1.5 years</p>

<p>Study sometimes are done as well.</p>

<p>Diff between NTP and prod development (data is where you start , investigation approach)</p>

<p>Get idea of solutions‚Ä¶ Litho insight, prototypes, Java, matlab for
prototyping‚Ä¶</p>

<p>What is the difference between you and CS? missed this Q‚Ä¶.</p>

<p>How is CS overlay different from you guys?</p>

<p>what data are you looking at? machine data and overlay data?</p>

<p>What will I learn? What will I develop in?</p>

<p>How much time do you spend on analysing data, extracting info, vs
communication vs presentation?</p>

<p><strong>What does the job entail my version</strong></p>

<p>Help customer with software tools necessary to improve his OPO.</p>

<p>Understand what the customer wants and why he has overlay issues. You
do that by looking at the data from the FAP‚Ä¶</p>

<p>breakdowns,</p>

<p>feasibility and help them achive where they want to go?</p>

<p>extract insights from data</p>

<p>make experiments with customer‚Ä¶</p>
