#### Story so far
In this [blog post][marr_thej_4] we talked about sex and the associated probabilities of having sex(50 to 80 times a year) seems to be around 50%, after marriage. 

In this [blog post][marr_thej_5], we discussed briefly that the chances of one marrying an independent women are ~30%. Also, we recognize in the same post that the divorce rates as being ~50%

<h4 id="cost-of-marriage">Cost of marriage</h4>

<p>The cost of a marriage comes in various forms:
1) Cost of marriage: 10 to 15 k Euros
2) Cost of Divorce: half of your savings <a href="/marriage(5).html">when not an independent woman</a> + loss of custody of kids
3) Cost for sex: in form of gifts or doing other things to get there
4) Cost of kids for 16 years: 400 Euros a month for two kids (400<em>12</em>16=76.8k Euros)
5) Cost of education for kids: 5k euros
6) Cost of kids marriage: ~10k euros
7) Cost of vacations: atleast 2k euros a year 
8) Cost of lack of sex: in the form of affairs, prostitutes, mental health
9) Cost of existence of a nagging wife: mental health
10) Cost of buying useless things such as a new car, new house, painting the house, refurnishing the house etc., : 1k a year on average</p>

<p>All this is money that can be used somewhere else, for someone else in need, or hopelessly just for you in your adventures.</p>

<h4 id="pay-for-sex">Pay for sex</h4>
<p>How about considering paying for sex. Sex with a prostitute comes at a cost of 57 euros for 15-20 minutes. That would mean just using the cost of marriage you could get fucked ~200 times. With my current savings per month, I can fuck about 20 times a month. Although i have never been there, I do have access and can go there. Granted that it wont be as personal as getting it from a girl friend, but that could definitely be an option. Of course, if fucking is the goal, then all the above numbers is for you.</p>

<h4 id="pick-up">Pick up</h4>
<p>Wait a minute. But how about just working on [‚ÄúPick up artistry‚Äù][pickup_wiki] instead? Much cheaper and it is a skillset that will cover you for a long time. It takes time and practice like every other skill, but should nevertheless be worth your while. There is no dearth of women in this beautiful country. Learn the art of picking up girls. If you really want a nice girlfriend, who also doubles up as a fuck buddy, put your money and time in here rather than in prostitution centers for a lousy lay.</p>

<h4 id="advice-for-those-in-marriage">Advice for those in marriage</h4>
<p>The common advice on [‚ÄúDont marry‚Äù][dont_marry] is to stay in control. To never back down unless you are in the wrong. Don‚Äôt take shit. People say things like this, but how exactly do you fucking take control. No idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWhat a bunch of whiny pussy whipped shitheads. I‚Äôve been married for over 25 years and I have full control of everything. How did I do it? Easy, just adopt an attitude of, ‚Äúhey, if you don‚Äôt like it, there‚Äôs the fucking door‚Äù. This attitude has served my marriage well. My wife thinks I‚Äôm one step away from walking out, and she treats me like a king. Of course I treat her with respect and don‚Äôt rub it in her face, but she knows that in the end, I run the show. We get along just fine. Get a grip you fucking pussies. stay in control‚Äù  <br />
-someone in the thread [‚ÄúDont marry‚Äù][dont_marry]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I don‚Äôt get from this is how exactly does one stay in control. He says he tells her where the door is, but doesn‚Äôt she already have the hand from the marriage in the first place? She can leave and she gets HALF.</p>

<p>Of course any advice I give is useless, as I have no experience. Period.</p>

<h1 id="open-issue">Open Issue</h1>
<p>Why does my brother and all my cousins and parents think they should marry and go on to say that I should marry? odd!</p>

<p>People who marry look so happy outside! But they look so happy outside? Probability</p>

<p>taxes</p>

<p>Quantify the idea of companionship and take another look at old age!</p>
