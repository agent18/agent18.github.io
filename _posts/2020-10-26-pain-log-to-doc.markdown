## What I have been doing

- slowly increasing if it doesn't cause pain while I am doing it

	- all exercises except the ones like shoulder press
			
1. chest bicep legs 1.5 times a week (depends on pain if I reduce)

2. Climbing once a week (recent)

3. Running 3 times depending on pain (only on treadmill)

4. Core 3-4 times a week (45 or 30s depends )

5. Sitting on ball half an hour to 1 hr a day.

(next day....)

### right knee giving way

- **No progress** with the least weights (been doing extensions and increasing
  weight in it)
  
  ---- do more leg press? 

### right ass tightening

1. Sep 1-14th had two episodes I think (popped ibuprofin)

2. Previous week oct 6th didnt' run, oct 7th ran and oct 8th  and then stopped. I
   still push but beyond a point just stop
   
3. oct 14th back was just sitting entire day at an angle

	Ass gets tight on the next day and you have a bad nights sleep.

4. Last 1.5 weeks its been ok

----- core longer 50s, with weight short (no reaction next day)

---- cycling (more workout more heavier)

---- rowing (alternate)

---- running 

### Right side Leg still hurting from time to time

Even now, when I try to sit, I know  I have pain there. After I sit on
ball for few mins.

### Right side v-joints hurting after climbing and running 

- recent after climbing and next day and running (It didn't exacerbate
  though)
  
### Right shoulder impinging

- bicep curl (always) 4kg/hand recently moved to 2kg/hand
- and sometimes the scapula

---- pull down & peck deck (shoulder down & back always)

### Right muscle between bicep and  shoulder

- after a climbing session (still hurts 3 days later)
- I have had this before when I play basketball
- during maxing out on chest press

---- don't be too worried

## Improvements in weights

1. I still try to maxout on chest press (no chest press)

2. Improvement in right hand excercises went from X to X + 7kg on the
   pully system. That actually seems ok.
   
3. Maxing out on inner and outer thigs (but had pain in the pelvis
   joints)
   
4. Core once a week i do 5kg + in some excercises

   
use peck deck and chest...


## jan 4 2021

I have a grim image about my health. 

I used to climb once a week 2 times chest and legs and one time run
and walk most days...

Stopped climbing... as it resulted in pain 3 days later even and since
then I have irritation and pain in my right shoulder.

Started going to gym 3-4 times and running and rowing... rowing gave me
pain on left shoulder randomly... and one time hard, one time many reps.


## complaint

Still when I sit on the bike, that part hurts. Last week I had a
really bad pain (past 3 days I didn't do much as somehting was huring
in my leg) and then this. 5th day I start excercising the legs (squats
body weight) and then now I am having this pain where I am limping
moving in my bed is hard (a bit to the side.)


Shoulder is not really great... sometimes doing side planks or planks
is also a problem.

Knee not giving way so to say, but it feels week as hell. It starts
hurting is and around hte knee.
