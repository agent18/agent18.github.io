## GOAL:

Summary, wague

Rationalist taboo


Clear goals, immediate feedback, challenging 


### Clear Goals

Based on [this](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/) 

<!-- Making a list of options -->
What do you want to do in life? Exact examples of profiles that you
would like to be like?


What are the different career paths you think are available to you?
Give one way how you would achieve it?

<!-- Rankingish your options  -->
Compare them based on Skills, Connections, Credentials, Runway,
&
Personal fit, job satisfaction, Impact

<!-- Write out key uncertainities -->
What is the info that can change your ranking?

### What do you hate?
rewriting, correcting spelling, rewriting large large chunks of shit!

<!-- Get wholistic view using S-TAB -->
Lets try to work on sections that are well defined as shown in the
Clear Goals section. We will continue to have the overview of what we
are doing, instead of just writing using the power of cycling `S-TAB`.

<!-- Re-write and refactor, do not repeat -->
We will write like we speak and edit per section or subsection. We
will refactor, rewrite and correct spelling then and there or as
required. We will just not keep blabbing shit for one hr as that makes
it difficult for editing.

<!-- Remove -->
We will remove everything as is required.


No wifi writing for 45 mins

## Making a list of options
### What do you want to be?

Either I earn-to-give or we do direct work, which leads to saving
lives. Earning to give needs no explanation.An example of direct work
would be to lead an NGO that stages interventions.



Over the course of sifting through [80k hours](80000hrs.org) website, I have seen
many profiles and would aspire to be like those people. Below is a
small summary of such profiles.

#### Earning-to-give 
- **An investment banker** who will earn in millions and give away >50% of
his salary.

- **Management Consulting** and earn > 250k$  in 5-10 years and give
  as much as possible
  
- **Data scientist/Project Management** and earn in 200k$ in 5-10
  years and give as much as possible
  
- **Programming** and earn in 200k$ in 5-10 years and give as much as
  possible

- **Entrepreneurship**
  
  * [ ] Earning potential in each of these professions please


[Ben West](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/ben-west/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentwest/)) an entrepreneur was in connection with
80k hours, able to set aside his uncertainty and now based on his
evaluation, he is expected to donate millions to charity. He is going
to keep a minimum fucking wage.

Amazing, he can even say things like this!

#### Direct working

>80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should
>earn to give long term. we think that most people should be doing
>things like politics, policy, high-value research, for-profit and
>non-profit entrepreneurship, and direct work for highly socially
>valuable organizations.

- Found & Lead Effective Altruism organizations as necessary or most
  impactful
  
[Tara Macaulay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)), (then) head of operation (now CEO)
in the Centre for Effective Altruism. Tara has always been outstanding
at her work, be it with saving money for her company or rising the
ranks very fast. She has apparently left a lasting impact in Bhutan
where she worked on direct impact project

*She interned without pay at CEA* leading the fuck out of it and then
rose the ranks to become the current CEO. 

TBW, She has no MBA degrees. She has a pharma degree.

[Rob Mather](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-mather-b0331235/)), CEO of Against Malaria foundation,
critically acclaimed as one of the most effective organizations.

TBW, He has had top education, and possibly an all the time high
achiever who went to Harvard Business School and University of
Cambridge.

[David Goldberg](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/david-goldberg/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjonathangoldberg/)), co-founder of Founders Pledge,
that makes Tech entrepreneurs donate by pledging in case their
startups succeed.

TBW, He is definitely another high achiever, who went to Cambridge,
but has a degree in philosophy. He has done everything other than
continuing with philosophy. He has founded 2 organizations/companies,

>Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance in the US, started
>and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
>in California. All in, a pretty bizarre career trajectory if Iâ€™m
>honest, which was largely the result of having no clear idea of what
>I wanted to do with my life until recently.

  * [ ] Seems to be a scope to intern at these places (seems to be
        working based on availability)
		
	
[Niel Bowerman ](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/niel-bowerman/)(Linkedin), previously the Assistant Director of
Future of Humanity Institute, (Oxford University), is another
outstanding talent featured in the 80k hours website.

TBW he does not have an MBA, he is a physics major, currently handling
fundraising, operations management etc... and now he is the head of AI
policy. 

**Lessons learnt:**

Not everyone has an MBA. Everyone has shown definite signs of
greatness from the beginning and looking at their profile, they are
headed for more greatness. 

Strong intterpersonal skills maybe?

- Being an Analyst, researcher at GiveWell

In organizations like GiveWell and 80000 hrs, they need people to do
the research to identify using data & researching what is better and
how we can do best. In other words solving problems with limited data,
knowing what type of data is interesting and finding it.

Here the main criteria are strong critical thinking skills, and
statistics/Math knowledge. 

- Policy and others

I think this is too far-fetched for me. I skip it

#### Building career capital

[Dillon Bowen](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/dillon-bowen/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dillon-bowen-409791a1/)) another high achiever is working
towards his Economics PhD based on the counseling he got from
80k. Economics PhD is highly recommended graduate program by 80k
hours, due to the high impact in direct working.

But I don't really think I have the age or the talent for an Economics
PhD.



TBW, He has no MBA, as a result.

[Peter Huford](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/peter-hurford/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhurford8/)), another outstanding talent, taught
himself how to program from political science background that now, he
is improving his skills in business, programming and finance and also
having extra time to work on other charity projects.


  * [ ] Appears that I should follow something like this, and talk to
        Herman maybe, as the spending time on an MBA to do some IB is
        not really seeming to be required. A better understanding or
        working or creation of new things can increase the outcome 10
        fold in no time. I think I should just focus on things like
        this and get better and become really skillful.


#### summary

In summary I would like the skills to be like these people or earn
like this. I would like to leave such a legacy behind like that of
TARA. It is important for me to dream big and currently these people
are already like a hard goal, a challenging goal for me I guess.

The importance of direct work has been stressed a lot by 80k hours. In
the long run that is what I guess I should be doing. But for the next
few years, no harm in making money as well as building career
capital. But again, money is not the objective now. Gaining skills to
make crazy impact is.

So, Ability to work in leading roles or operational roles in NGO's or
found my own NGO, is one of the things I see myself doing. or even
doing the research that they deem the most necessary.

### Making the list

Making a list according to 80k hours sounds far-too-specific like
"economics researcher focusing on global health", "marketing for meat
substitutes" etc...

I am afraid I am right now only trying to figure out what could be the
direction I would be expected to go in, i.e., **the next few years &
early career choices** in an attempt of collecting career capital in
the direction of where I want to be. I assume I cannot be certain in
determining exactly what I am going to be doing @ 45. But as pointed
out earlier, you can see what I would like to grow towards.

Furthermore if I miss something, I would like to put the onus on my
reviewers, aka the 80k community, an STM and the decision tool to help
me out.

#### My rough list!

Roughly I imagine the list to be:

1) Continuing in the same job or being a design engineer and rising
the ranks as so.

- Far too specific information learning at the moment (suspect it is useless)

As echoed previously to myself and in my archive, it appears that I am
learning something too specific, like how to make drawings and how to
design in tight tolerances, these are far too specific

- I do a bit of trouble shooting and critical thinking, I would like
  to do more.

- I do not want to work on puzzling out more about volumes and
interferences manually, say using (god-forbid) powerpoint. for
example, things I could do with a better tool. Of course I could have
a better way of work. Well let there be better problems to solve.

2) An MBA to management consulting or IB or trading(very high job
satisfaction according to 80k hours) for now, hoping to get some
experience and a lot of money, to propel career ahead.

Right now it appears that the an MBA can open avenues into consulting,
IB and Trading. These seem to allow to get good experience and a lot
of money. Job satisfaction and long hours might suffer for a few.

Other than doing an MBA there dont seem many options. And I have
echoed my sentiment to a couple of MBA graduates who seem to agree
([IB at JP Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ram-narayan-86b7b199/)),([Marketeer from Newyork who has scholarships in
MBA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rawanalhaffar/)), Another friend who is an Analyst in California going into
product management.

But right now I do not need to make the choice of what I will be
taking. I can leave that decision for sometime in the future.

3) Data science (research, critical thinking?), moving on to
programming or not

I sort of club DS and programming together. As I see DS my first
direction to go into even if programming is what I might do in the
end. DS already involves some programming and I can get a job I think
quickly (3 months) in Netherlands and from there get better at it and
programming and see where it takes me. Although, DS would be much more
oriented towards critical thinking I guess.

4) Starting up

No idea where to start, no ideas of what to start, lack of skill and
confidence. A tech start-up sounds interesting, maybe I could find
some work there. I could go over to some meeting in rotterdam and see
what the scene is like. 

I think we should expect a long lead time with tech startups,
especially ones that involve making a phisical product of any
nature. 

Although I am currently working in a startup I see that I don't have
any "startup benifits"

5) Joining an NGO, starting as an Intern

6) Data-science/Programming in Finance (best of two worlds)
	
#### Career Quiz: recommended list of careers

The career quiz with the selected options result in the following
career choices: 

1) Could you become good at math, science or logic?
Yes (outperform 80% of graduates)

2) Could you become good at writing and speaking? 
Yes (Outperforming 80% of graduates in a humanities subject)

3) Are you happy betting on a small chance of a big impact?
No

4) Are you happy trying to work in the most demanding fields?
Yes

Challenging and long hours should not be a problem I suppose. I have
seen evidences of this in my past, with my master thesis(10-14 hrs a
day, programming, reading), with my work in IIT Madras (easily clocked
10 hrs or more a day for 1 year atleast), Courses in my masters
etc... and for a while I would work 8 hrs a day and come back home and
spend 2 hrs a day writing and researching etc... 

5) How far through your career are you?

Early (27) finished masters and working for ~2 years

6) How do you want to contribute? 

All possible ways: Direct, indirect, earning to give, research etc...

And the out put is:

- Policy oriented Civil servces
- Economics PhD
- Data Science (skill building and earning to give)
- Working at effective non-profites
- Machine learning PhD
- Software engineering (skill building and earning to give)
- Trading in quantitative hedge funds

When we are ready to bet on small chances then:

- Congressional staffer
- Policy oriented Civil services
- Machine learning PhD
- Working at effective Altruist organizations
- Founding effective non-profits
- Data science
- Party politics


#### Comparing

The plan is to write about these:

Compare them based on Career Capital:  Skills, Connections, Credentials, Runway,
&
Personal fit, job satisfaction, Supportive conditions, Impact

And to all the career options I have until now.

Following this, I would like to also use the decision making chart and
the decision tool of the 80k hours website to do the same. 



**Career Capital**

Skills:

>Skills â€“ what will you learn in this job, and how fast will you
>learn? You can break skills down into transferable skills, knowledge
>and personality traits. Some especially useful transferable skills
>include: personal productivity, analysis and problem-solving, the
>ability to learn quickly, decision-making, social skills, and
>management. We cover why and how to learn them in a later article. If
>you want to do good, you also need to learn all about the worldâ€™s
>most pressing problems and how to solve them. A job will be best for
>learning when you are pushed to improve and get lots of feedback from
>mentors.

Connections:

>Connections â€“ who will you work with and meet in this job? Your
>connections are how youâ€™ll find opportunities, spread ideas and start
>new projects. The people you spend time with also shape your
>character. For both reasons, itâ€™s important to make connections who
>are influential and who care about social impact.


Credentials:

> will this job act as a good signal to future collaborators or
> employers? Note that we donâ€™t just mean formal credentials like
> having a law degree, but also your achievements and reputation. If
> youâ€™re a writer, itâ€™s the quality of your blog. If youâ€™re a coder,
> itâ€™s your GitHub.

Runway:

>how much money will you save in this job? Your runway is how long you
>could comfortably live with no income. It depends on both your
>savings and how much you could reduce your expenses by. We recommend
>aiming for at least six months of runway to maintain your financial
>security. 12-18 months of runway is even more useful because it gives
>you the flexibility to make a major career change. Itâ€™s usually worth
>paying down high-interest debt before donating more than 1% per year
>or taking a big pay cut for greater impact.

**Supportive conditions**

> Impact and personal life
> Engaging work - Will you get freedom to decide how to work, clear tasks, clear feedback and variety in what you do?
> Colleagues- Will you like them and will they support you?
> basic needs- Will you earn enough money, will the hours be manageable, and will the commute be reasonable?
> Fit with rest of your life -â€“ Will you be able to improve your
> personal relationships, and uphold any other important personal
> priorities?

[Source: how to compare different careers ](https://80000hours.org/articles/framework/#questions-for-assessing-each-factor) 

**Personal Fit**

What are your chances of excelling in that area?

##### Design engineering (Machine Design) in 'Europe'

So the assumptions here is that I will try to grow in the precision
industry as a precision engineer, and slowly climb the ladder of
becoming a team lead (DL).

**Skills**: as compared to say management consulting is a '5/10'

Right now I am learning a very specific amount of skills. Skills like
making proper drawings, Skills on how to design for the precision
industry, how to keep things simple etc... Great for the precision
engineering market but I dont think it preps me for the Leadership
type of jobs that I plan in the future.

Even if I become a design leader (as they call it here), it would take
say 8 years atleast (35), where I go into a CTO kind of role, where I am
managing a technical team, knowing on a high level what my team is
doing. Maybe there are other possibilities, but 8 years of engineering
seems quite unnecessary. 

A part of my work is also critical thinking but it is definitely a
small part (20-30%), but it is a small part. 

A last word is that as an engineer I have to do a lot of unnecessary
things, kind a like doing experiments manually. In other words wasting
time (Not doing anything creative or useful in the long run). Time is
really precious and you would want every single minute to count. I see
myself 'wasting' a lot of time here. 

Last is I work for <40 hrs a week and I am barely at any pressure or
pushed to achieve great things,

**Connections**:

I am not sure how these connections 

**Credentials**:

I see myself growing up the ladder very very slowly (4-5 years per
promotion)

**Runway**:

**Personal Fit**:

**Impact**:

**Job satisfaction**:

#### 

**Skills**

**Connections**

**Credentials**

**Runway**

**Personal fit**

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

**Impact**

### Why not an MBA?

I suspect I am seeing signs and strong signs pointing me to do
otherwise. I think I need to clearly write it all out. It is an exit
strategy and thats all it is. Maybe you can do other things? Get in
touch with them people!

Amidst the above, examples of profiles without an MBA,
http://www.mercyforanimals.org/jobs doesn't require an MBA! But they
do need relavant experience, sometimes lilke, social sciences etc...

The places I am targetting appears that all I need is crazy as
motherfucking skill, thats it. interpersonal or whatever.

## Plan

This post is going to serve as a summary, before I apply to 80k
hours. I see an stm talk about 21k words etc... on his wall.

For me the problem with so many words is having to rewrite the whole thing(not
motivating), 

But I see time and again that he is trying to write a lot. Somehow, for some
reason he belives that writing is everything, or writing helps in solving what
he wants!

### P.S

Working at the library from 8:11 with a small pee break. Set up
markdown mode coloring, figured out how to add comments in markdown mode.
	





## Reflection

Work at a growing organization

Pursue certain graduate studies

Develop valuable transferable skill

Do what contributes to build career capital


Blockchain
## Ideas

Please look at reaching out to the 80k community with this post
regarding the line of thought.

## Log
20 May: established the frame work spent quite a few hours in the library
21 May: Wanked
	22 May: 1.5 hrs continuous, no break, of course on a mind level 1k words
