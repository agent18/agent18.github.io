## GOAL:

Summary, wague

Rationalist taboo


Clear goals, immediate feedback, challenging 


### Clear Goals

Based on [this](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/) 

<!-- Making a list of options -->
What do you want to do in life? Exact examples of profiles that you
would like to be like?


What are the different career paths you think are available to you?
Give one way how you would achieve it?

<!-- Rankingish your options  -->
Compare them based on Skills, Connections, Credentials, Runway,
&
Personal fit, job satisfaction, Impact

<!-- Write out key uncertainities -->
What is the info that can change your ranking?

### What do you hate?
rewriting, correcting spelling, rewriting large large chunks of shit!

<!-- Get wholistic view using S-TAB -->
Lets try to work on sections that are well defined as shown in the
Clear Goals section. We will continue to have the overview of what we
are doing, instead of just writing using the power of cycling `S-TAB`.

<!-- Re-write and refactor, do not repeat -->
We will write like we speak and edit per section or subsection. We
will refactor, rewrite and correct spelling then and there or as
required. We will just not keep blabbing shit for one hr as that makes
it difficult for editing.

<!-- Remove -->
We will remove everything as is required.


No wifi writing for 45 mins

## Making a list of options
### What do you want to be?

Either I earn-to-give or we do direct work, which leads to saving
lives. Earning to give needs no explanation.An example of direct work
would be to lead an NGO that stages interventions.



Over the course of sifting through [80k hours](80000hrs.org) website, I have seen
many profiles and would aspire to be like those people. Below is a
small summary of such profiles.

#### Earning-to-give 
- **An investment banker** who will earn in millions and give away >50% of
his salary.

- **Management Consulting** and earn > 250k$  in 5-10 years and give
  as much as possible
  
- **Data scientist/Project Management** and earn in 200k$ in 5-10
  years and give as much as possible
  
- **Programming** and earn in 200k$ in 5-10 years and give as much as
  possible

- **Entrepreneurship**
  
  * [ ] Earning potential in each of these professions please


[Ben West](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/ben-west/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentwest/)) an entrepreneur was in connection with
80k hours, able to set aside his uncertainty and now based on his
evaluation, he is expected to donate millions to charity. He is going
to keep a minimum fucking wage.

Amazing, he can even say things like this!

#### Direct working

>80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should
>earn to give long term. we think that most people should be doing
>things like politics, policy, high-value research, for-profit and
>non-profit entrepreneurship, and direct work for highly socially
>valuable organizations.

- Found & Lead Effective Altruism organizations as necessary or most
  impactful
  
[Tara Macaulay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)), (then) head of operation (now CEO)
in the Centre for Effective Altruism. Tara has always been outstanding
at her work, be it with saving money for her company or rising the
ranks very fast. She has apparently left a lasting impact in Bhutan
where she worked on direct impact project

*She interned without pay at CEA* leading the fuck out of it and then
rose the ranks to become the current CEO. 

TBW, She has no MBA degrees. She has a pharma degree.

[Rob Mather](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-mather-b0331235/)), CEO of Against Malaria foundation,
critically acclaimed as one of the most effective organizations.

TBW, He has had top education, and possibly an all the time high
achiever who went to Harvard Business School and University of
Cambridge.

[David Goldberg](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/david-goldberg/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjonathangoldberg/)), co-founder of Founders Pledge,
that makes Tech entrepreneurs donate by pledging in case their
startups succeed.

TBW, He is definitely another high achiever, who went to Cambridge,
but has a degree in philosophy. He has done everything other than
continuing with philosophy. He has founded 2 organizations/companies,

>Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance in the US, started
>and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
>in California. All in, a pretty bizarre career trajectory if I’m
>honest, which was largely the result of having no clear idea of what
>I wanted to do with my life until recently.

  * [ ] Seems to be a scope to intern at these places (seems to be
        working based on availability)
		
	
[Niel Bowerman ](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/niel-bowerman/)(Linkedin), previously the Assistant Director of
Future of Humanity Institute, (Oxford University), is another
outstanding talent featured in the 80k hours website.

TBW he does not have an MBA, he is a physics major, currently handling
fundraising, operations management etc... and now he is the head of AI
policy. 

**Lessons learnt:**

Not everyone has an MBA. Everyone has shown definite signs of
greatness from the beginning and looking at their profile, they are
headed for more greatness. 

Strong intterpersonal skills maybe?

- Being an Analyst, researcher at GiveWell

In organizations like GiveWell and 80000 hrs, they need people to do
the research to identify using data & researching what is better and
how we can do best. In other words solving problems with limited data,
knowing what type of data is interesting and finding it.

Here the main criteria are strong critical thinking skills, and
statistics/Math knowledge. 

- Policy and others

I think this is too far-fetched for me. I skip it

#### Building career capital

[Dillon Bowen](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/dillon-bowen/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dillon-bowen-409791a1/)) another high achiever is working
towards his Economics PhD based on the counseling he got from
80k. Economics PhD is highly recommended graduate program by 80k
hours, due to the high impact in direct working.

But I don't really think I have the age or the talent for an Economics
PhD.



TBW, He has no MBA, as a result.

[Peter Huford](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/peter-hurford/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhurford8/)), another outstanding talent, taught
himself how to program from political science background that now, he
is improving his skills in business, programming and finance and also
having extra time to work on other charity projects.


  * [ ] Appears that I should follow something like this, and talk to
        Herman maybe, as the spending time on an MBA to do some IB is
        not really seeming to be required. A better understanding or
        working or creation of new things can increase the outcome 10
        fold in no time. I think I should just focus on things like
        this and get better and become really skillful.


#### summary

In summary I would like the skills to be like these people or at least
earn a lot to give. I would like to leave such a legacy behind like
that of TARA. It is important for me to dream big and currently these
people are already like a hard goal, a challenging goal for me I
guess.

The importance of direct work has been stressed a lot by 80k hours. In
the long run that is what I guess I should be doing. But for the next
few years, no harm in making money as well as building career
capital. But money is not the objective, getting yourself in shape to
do good is. Gaining skills to make crazy impact is.

So, Ability to work in leading roles or operational roles in NGO's or
found my own NGO, is one of the things I see myself doing. or even
doing the research that they deem the most necessary, or earning
crazily to give.

### Making the list

Making a list according to 80k hours sounds far-too-specific like
"economics researcher focusing on global health", "marketing for meat
substitutes" etc...

I am afraid I am right now only trying to figure out what could be the
direction I would be expected to go in, i.e., **the next few years &
early career choices** in an attempt of collecting career capital in
the direction of where I want to be. I assume I cannot be certain in
determining exactly what I am going to be doing @ 45. But as pointed
out earlier, you can see what I would like to grow towards.

Furthermore if I miss something, I would like to put the onus on my
reviewers, aka the 80k community, an STM and the decision tool to help
me out.

#### My rough list!

Roughly I imagine the list to be:

1) Continuing in the same job or being a design engineer and rising
the ranks as so.

- Far too specific information learning at the moment (suspect it is useless)

As echoed previously to myself and in my archive, it appears that I am
learning something too specific, like how to make drawings and how to
design in tight tolerances, these are far too specific

- I do a bit of trouble shooting and critical thinking, I would like
  to do more.

- I do not want to work on puzzling out more about volumes and
interferences manually, say using (god-forbid) powerpoint. for
example, things I could do with a better tool. Of course I could have
a better way of work. Well let there be better problems to solve.

2) An MBA to management consulting or IB or trading(very high job
satisfaction according to 80k hours) for now, hoping to get some
experience and a lot of money, to propel career ahead.

Right now it appears that the an MBA can open avenues into consulting,
IB and Trading. These seem to allow to get good experience and a lot
of money. Job satisfaction and long hours might suffer for a few.

Other than doing an MBA there dont seem many options. And I have
echoed my sentiment to a couple of MBA graduates who seem to agree
([IB at JP Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ram-narayan-86b7b199/)),([Marketeer from Newyork who has scholarships in
MBA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rawanalhaffar/)), Another friend who is an Analyst in California going into
product management.

But right now I do not need to make the choice of what I will be
taking. I can leave that decision for sometime in the future.

3) Data science (research, critical thinking?), moving on to
programming or not

I sort of club DS and programming together. As I see DS my first
direction to go into even if programming is what I might do in the
end. DS already involves some programming and I can get a job I think
quickly (3 months) in Netherlands and from there get better at it and
programming and see where it takes me. Although, DS would be much more
oriented towards critical thinking I guess.

4) Starting up

No idea where to start, no ideas of what to start, lack of skill and
confidence. A tech start-up sounds interesting, maybe I could find
some work there. I could go over to some meeting in rotterdam and see
what the scene is like. 

I think we should expect a long lead time with tech startups,
especially ones that involve making a phisical product of any
nature. 

Although I am currently working in a startup I see that I don't have
any "startup benifits"

5) Joining an NGO, starting as an Intern

6) Data-science/Programming in Finance (best of two worlds)
	
#### Career Quiz: recommended list of careers

The career quiz with the selected options result in the following
career choices: 

1) Could you become good at math, science or logic?
Yes (outperform 80% of graduates)

2) Could you become good at writing and speaking? 
Yes (Outperforming 80% of graduates in a humanities subject)

3) Are you happy betting on a small chance of a big impact?
No

4) Are you happy trying to work in the most demanding fields?
Yes

Challenging and long hours should not be a problem I suppose. I have
seen evidences of this in my past, with my master thesis(10-14 hrs a
day, programming, reading), with my work in IIT Madras (easily clocked
10 hrs or more a day for 1 year atleast), Courses in my masters
etc... and for a while I would work 8 hrs a day and come back home and
spend 2 hrs a day writing and researching etc... 

5) How far through your career are you?

Early (27) finished masters and working for ~2 years

6) How do you want to contribute? 

All possible ways: Direct, indirect, earning to give, research etc...

And the out put is:

- Policy oriented Civil servces
- Economics PhD
- Data Science (skill building and earning to give)
- Working at effective non-profites
- Machine learning PhD
- Software engineering (skill building and earning to give)
- Trading in quantitative hedge funds

When we are ready to bet on small chances then:

- Congressional staffer
- Policy oriented Civil services
- Machine learning PhD
- Working at effective Altruist organizations
- Founding effective non-profits
- Data science
- Party politics


#### My next steps

The focus for this article should be that I deveop through this post
what I should do next, like in the next 6 months. Where should I begin
and what should I do.

I am broadly looking at few things based on the rough list I have and
the Career Quiz

1. Sticking to design engineering

	- Working in the US?
	- Staying in DE
	- Attempting to startup
	- Going into the NGO management after a few years in this field.
	
2. Moving to DataScience
   
   - DS
   - Programming
   - Machine learning PhD
   - Working at GiveWell type of NGO's
   
3. Doing an MBA

	- IB
	- NGO as analyst or management
	- Management Consulting
	- Marketting Sales
	- trading in quantitative hedge funds
	
	
4. Civil services

	Dont know where or how to start, other than in India, but I am not
    sure of the evaluating the kind of impact I can have in India
	
5. Think Tanks

6. Working at Effective Altruism organizations

#### Comparing

The plan is to write about these:

Compare them based on Career Capital:  Skills, Connections, Credentials, Runway,
&
Personal fit, job satisfaction, Supportive conditions, Impact

And to all the career options I have until now.

Following this, I would like to also use the decision making chart and
the decision tool of the 80k hours website to do the same. 



**Career Capital**

Skills:

>Skills – what will you learn in this job, and how fast will you
>learn? You can break skills down into transferable skills, knowledge
>and personality traits. Some especially useful transferable skills
>include: personal productivity, analysis and problem-solving, the
>ability to learn quickly, decision-making, social skills, and
>management. We cover why and how to learn them in a later article. If
>you want to do good, you also need to learn all about the world’s
>most pressing problems and how to solve them. A job will be best for
>learning when you are pushed to improve and get lots of feedback from
>mentors.

- Transferable skills
  - personal productivity
  - Critical thinking, analysis and problem solving
  - ability to learn quickly
  - decision-making
  - social skills
  - management
- Knowledge

- Personality traits
  - Confidence



Connections:

>Connections – who will you work with and meet in this job? Your
>connections are how you’ll find opportunities, spread ideas and start
>new projects. The people you spend time with also shape your
>character. For both reasons, it’s important to make connections who
>are influential and who care about social impact.

Are my connections going to get me jobs in different industries or
other industries?

Are my connections going to inspire me to do good?

Are my connections influential?

Credentials:

> will this job act as a good signal to future collaborators or
> employers? Note that we don’t just mean formal credentials like
> having a law degree, but also your achievements and reputation. If
> you’re a writer, it’s the quality of your blog. If you’re a coder,
> it’s your GitHub.

Runway:

>how much money will you save in this job? Your runway is how long you
>could comfortably live with no income. It depends on both your
>savings and how much you could reduce your expenses by. We recommend
>aiming for at least six months of runway to maintain your financial
>security. 12-18 months of runway is even more useful because it gives
>you the flexibility to make a major career change. It’s usually worth
>paying down high-interest debt before donating more than 1% per year
>or taking a big pay cut for greater impact.

Ability to quickly save enough money for 18 months is what seems to be
defining runway. How much I can donate is a question answerd by the
impact section.

Runway seems to be always important.

**Supportive conditions**

> Impact and personal life
> Engaging work - Will you get freedom to decide how to work, clear tasks, clear feedback and variety in what you do?
> Colleagues- Will you like them and will they support you?
> basic needs- Will you earn enough money, will the hours be manageable, and will the commute be reasonable?
> Fit with rest of your life -– Will you be able to improve your
> personal relationships, and uphold any other important personal
> priorities?

[Source: how to compare different careers ](https://80000hours.org/articles/framework/#questions-for-assessing-each-factor) 

**Personal Fit**

What are your chances of excelling in that area?

**In summary,**

 $ (f1xCareer Capital +f2xImpact +f3xSupportive conditions) *
 Personalfit
 
>If you are still early in your career, then it’s best to place
>greater importance on career capital than on role impact

>The more uncertain you are about the long-run, the more you should
>prioritise flexible career capital over

>The more altruistically-minded you are, the less weight you’ll need
>to place on job satisfaction relative to the other factors.

There by I see f1 = 1, f2 = 0.7, and f3 = 0.5.

80k suggests role-impact and not impact. This would mean that I
somehow have an idea of what problem I have chosen to focus
on. On a high level, it is all about saving lives, adding good years
to lives around the world now and later. 

To simplify the solving of the above problem, I suggest we just stick
to impact as being saving lives. I will try to make estimations of
saving lives with this.


#### Design engineering (Machine Design) in 'Europe'

So the assumptions here is that I will try to grow in the precision
industry as a precision engineer, and slowly climb the ladder of
becoming a team lead (DL) in a span of 8 years in
Netherlands/USA. Then start gaining skills in leadership and boast
decent achievements 

**Skills**: as compared to say management consulting is a '5/10'

Right now I am learning a very specific amount of skills. Skills like
making proper drawings, Skills on how to design for the precision
industry, What type of motors work where, how to keep things simple
etc... Great for the precision engineering market but I dont think it
preps me for the Leadership/research type of jobs that I plan in the future.

Even if I become a design leader (as they call it here), it would take
say 8 years atleast (35), where I go into a tech leadership kind of
role, where I am managing a technical team, knowing on a high level
what my team is doing. 

A part of my work is also critical thinking but it is definitely a
small part (20-30%), but it is a small part. 

A last word is that as an engineer I have to do a lot of unnecessary
things, kind a like doing experiments manually. In other words wasting
time (Not doing anything creative or useful in the long run). Time is
really precious and you would want every single minute to count. I see
myself 'wasting' a lot of time here. 

Last is I work for <40 hrs a week and I am barely at any pressure or
pushed to achieve great things,

As far as I have seen and the fact that even glassdoor says this, more
experience is not really valued a lot beyond 1-2 few decades. My
colleague ears 52k with 30 years of expereince and I earn 40k. If I
switch companies already I can make as much as him.

So, the dearth of transferable skills, the minimum quantity of
critical thinking, a decent amount of creativity building, 

- Transferable skills: 
  - personal productivity: 4
  - Critical thinking, analysis and problem solving: 5
  - ability to learn quickly: 8
  - decision-making: 4
  - social skills: 3
  - management: 4.5
  - Team workingish: 6.5
  
- Knowledge:  4

- Personality traits: 5.5
  - Confidence: 5.5

  

**Connections**:

I will work with other design engineers and physicists in the job. I
might be able to find opportunities in related fields. But I don't
think this would be useful, considering that this is probably not the
industry I should continue in. 

Are my connections going to get me jobs in different industries or
other industries?

Maybe, but definitely not different industries.

Are my connections going to inspire me to do good?

5-10% chance that may happen. These people are all about taking it
easy, taking some sun, travelling, girl friends  and thats it.

Are my connections influential?
There is a 20% chance that 1 out of 30-50 colleagues I would know
would use his influence to help me out. This is the right now of
course.

Considering all this, I give this a 3/10 if management consulting
connections would be an 8/10 for connections.


**Credentials**:

I see myself growing up the ladder very very slowly (4-5 years per
promotion). It is a slow working environment (mainly because of
research). Right now maybe I can boast to other precision companies
regarding what I could do for them.

Regarding great achievements, I don't think I have any, and if I will
have any in the coming years. Even If I move to a larger company I do
not see myself doing great things as a mechanical engineer. 

When I am trouble shooting for example, then there is scope for
achievement, but otherwise, it will always be normal. I am not in any
position to say save large sums of money for the company. 

It seems like a normal 9-5 job with some performance indicators of me
learning quickly but that is it I think.

For a writer it is his blog, for a coder it is his Github, for a
mechanical deisgner, it is his portfolio of work done till now, which
would of course be useful to take up other jobs in the same precision
industry. 

slow working , little accountability

**Runway**:

In Netherlands I can save about 14-20k euros/year at this moment based on where I
work. The growth would be 5% every year. Period.

**Personal Fit**:

To excel in this area would mean 

- being a typical engineer for the rest of my life and grow through
  the ranks slowly and probably consulting after a period of time.  
  I estimate this at 100% chance of success for me. This is like the
  minimum I should be able to achieve at any cost.[10/10]
  
- to give money either by starting up 

	The probability of succeeding in starting up, seems to be dependent on:
	- Chance of having the vision to be a Y-combinator level startup and
          applying (5%)	  
	- chance of getting accepted in Y-combinator (2.5%)
	- Chance of that startup succeeding (25% based on current
      [Ycombinator list](https://yclist.com/) of 11 years)
	- = 0.03% (by multiplying everything) [0.003/10]
	  

- learning the skills to lead/research after 8 years and using it to actually make impact.

    Success would be based on the following:
	- Possibility of learning the skills after 8 years of doing random
      design work @ 33 (80%)
	- Possibility of learning the right skills being in this industry
      (85% assuming any industry should be able to give me this skill
      or that I should be able to branch)
	- = 64% [6.4/10]



**Impact**:

The impact of being a typical engineer for the next 40 years is
estimated to be <300 lives. []

The impact of being a successful tech startup as per the earnings of
employees ([2.5m$](https://80000hours.org/2014/05/how-much-do-y-combinator-founders-earn/#fn:5)) is ~21k lives over 30 years, assuming I take
the next 10 years to prep for such a scheme.

As a person working for an NGO like either GiveWell or 80k, the
estimated impact ranges from 600 to 3000 lives over 40 years. Another
estimate for an analyst informs that 1500 lives will be saved. To keep
things simple, we stick to this final number of 1500 lives over 40
years. It is assumed that the contribution of the Analyst and the
contribution of the operations/managers is the same for lack of
knowledge, hopefully leading to a conservative number. As we will be
spending the next 10 years prepping for it in essence, we would have
970 lives of impact.


    
   


#### Data science

**Skills** 

Statistics, critical thinking, programming and machine learning could
be the knowledge and skills I would transfer to research based jobs,
and not necessarily leadership based jobs. However I suspect that a
role in project management after a few years could get me somewhere
like an all-rounder in the field of DS.

Also DS is only the starting point. Once I start DS, programming,
using different languages all will be things I will be working on,
which allows for a machine learning PhD maybe. DS looks like a good
place to start skills wise.

>The technical skills you develop also open the possibility to
>transition into different roles including software engineering,
>founding or joining early-stage startups, academia, and quant
>finance. - [80k-DS](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/) 

These are quite some possibilities 

- Transferable skills
  - personal productivity: 6
  - Critical thinking, analysis and problem solving: 7.5
  - ability to learn quickly: 7
  - decision-making:6
  - social skills: 4
  - management : 4.5
  - team working:
- Knowledge: 8

- Personality traits
  - Confidence: 6
  
I also suspect DS unlike the R&D work that I am doing, will be faster
paced and so I suspect that there is more learning happening.

**Connections**

Depending on where I work and what I do for which which companies. If
it is an in house job, then you are not chatting with clients, but if
you are consulting or doing work for clients, then possible better
connections than design engineering. For lack of knowing any better, I
raise it by one point more than Design engineering.

**Credentials**

DS has a fast paced scene as I get from 80k. Faster feedback cycle,
and large connection between work and outcomes can be felt. Further
impression I get is that you can brag about your outcomes, rather they
will be braggable to a future employer. Seeing my friend in DS and
what all he has bragged about being in Musigma in his first 2 years
sound amazing.

I suspect with this career, that would be one advantage, i.e., to be
able to brag with credentials. For example, X was low and I suggested
Y and then X soured.

Companies like KLM even have jobs for engineers and data
scientists. This could be quite lucrative for me and for the company,
as I span both the spectra.

So I give it a 7

**Runway** 
My friend in the US earns top dollar in Apple. Once you are Apple
worth, there seems to be a lot of potential scope and growth. I want
to believe that its like programming, where the society is highly
meritocratic, so get the NERD on.

Anyways, if I compare it to design engineering now and within
Netherlands, how much will I earn? According to [payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/54000e8c/Entry-Level-Amsterdam) both
design engineering in eindhoven area and data scientist in Amsterdam
for entry level have same pay. Both seem rather accessible to me.

So I give it a 5 as well. 

There is no reason to look at jobs in US as getting them now would be
hard and already feels unrealistic for now.

**Personal fit**

I think the personal fit is also good here. I am up for challenging
jobs all the time. I love programming and can spend like any other
sane human being a very large time working on it. 

I think I can very well learn and get better at these skills over some
time. I could quickly do bootcamps from home and become good at DS. I
am a fast learner and have worked on proper programming assignments
before. I have done a bit of critical thinking, hypothesis forming and
solving problems. I love it to begin with and I think there is a lot
of room to get better and I can get better at it, with more defined
ways of thinking.

So I think I have some experience with it. I can already work with
python and I am young. I see this as a great fit for me. I feel that I
should be able to achieve great forms of success within DS if I stick
to it over my entire career. So I offer this a 93% chance of success.

I have solved problems at my work, I enjoy doing them.


**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

- I should be enjoying the work
- Cleaning up the data will be boring, it takes up a lot of time.
- Basic needs will be satisfied mostly (money, hours and commute)
- Am not worried I will have too many problems, my point being it is
  not investment banking.
- Again I look up to people in the US like my brother and other actual
  data scientists, they seem to have time to do other things as well.

-Mentorship culture is quite common apparently according to 80k.

Overall, I suspect the time to be a little more, but keeping the
bigger picture in mind, that I am learning potential skill every extra
hour I work, I shall not be cribbing about it then.

I will rank it just a little smaller than Design engineering to factor
in the uncertainity.


**Impact**

There is a lot of scope for direct impact if one has skills, by using
this science in companies like:

>including the Center for Disease Control, Google, Khan Academy, Bayes
>Impact and DataKind.

Moneywise I have not much idea about my earning potential here in
Netherlands. As seen in the RunWay, both jobs pay the same. 

However if I work for top companies which seems like a possibility,
earning potential will be really good. 

Moving to the US already seems to increase earning-to-give, for now, I
shall not factor in this thing about going to US as the same can be
done for design engineering as well.

But, I think there is better chances of selling your self due to the
credentials earned. I am not able to scoop it out but, last time I saw
on glasssdoor, experience here is valued a lot as opposed to Design
engineering.

I am afraid the same holds for engineers in general, unless you
somehow move the ladder in management.

Where with DS, I don't see such warnings. 

I don't know how to measure its direct impact capabilities, but that
means I can either earn to give or work for NGOs, which has said
impact. and accordingly probabilities need to be processed.

#### Machine learning PhD

Its possible to go for it, I guess, but I am not sure of so many
things, such as the skill required to get in in the first place. If at
all anything, I will start with DS and see how I can branch to ML or
Programming. In order to put say 1000 hrs of work, it would take me a
year atleast, and before that I am not sure anyone is interested in me
doing a PhD. But I can look at a masters followed by a PhD route. But
let's see. It's all right now too far-fetched to me.

It a PhD. You learn more about programming and statistics for >10000 straight.

#### Economics PhD

Too far-fetched, based on the link I studied. As I am already 27 and
it takes quite some effort to get to the point of applying. I don't
have the means or the scope to go into this any further. 

Everything can be as high but it is not really a personal fit at all.

#### Working @ effective non profits

As per the frequent words from 80k hours, working in an NGO should not
be the first thing to do for 2 reasons:

1. Experience is not really considered epic here

We rather learn much much more in the industry and then make the jump
to use our skills to make lives better.

2. Going to another job from here would be hard.

Going back to the industry would be hard. The skills that we gain in
the industry are much more valuable.

#### Starting up

**Impact**
As a person working for an NGO like either GiveWell or 80k, the
estimated impact ranges from 600 to 3000 lives over 40 years. Another
estimate for an analyst informs that 1500 lives will be saved. To keep
things simple, we stick to this final number of 1500 lives over 40
years. It is assumed that the contribution of the Analyst and the
contribution of the operations/managers is the same for lack of
knowledge, hopefully leading to a conservative number. As we will be
spending the next 10 years prepping for it in essence, we would have
970 lives of impact.

#### Why not an MBA?

I suspect I am seeing signs and strong signs pointing me to do
otherwise. I think I need to clearly write it all out. It is an exit
strategy and thats all it is. Maybe you can do other things? Get in
touch with them people!

Amidst the above, examples of profiles without an MBA,
http://www.mercyforanimals.org/jobs doesn't require an MBA! But they
do need relavant experience, sometimes lilke, social sciences etc...

The places I am targetting appears that all I need is crazy as
motherfucking skill, thats it. interpersonal or whatever.

##  calculations
#### Impact calculations derivations
##### Calculating impact of direct working in 80k hours

**Problem**

80k hours has changed the lines of 1k people over 8 years. Per change
the cost is about 1337$. We seek to
estimate the contribution of an agent in case he joins 80k hours. 

**Assumptions or guesses**
80k is a reputed NGO, that is committed to create massive impact. It
is one such organization which I would want to join with the hopes of
creating large change.

They are about 15 people excluding advisors, 2 co-founders, 6 core
members, 3 freelancers and 4 operations people. 

My contribution would be 1.8% in the first year assuming my
contribution is [10%](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) of the co-founder, and core team 30% of
co-founder, management team 10% of co-founder each.

**Other factors**
- contribution of the donors
- Contribution of myself, incase someone else replaced me, how better
  I was than someone else


**Factors:**
- contribution of 80k compared to the total lives saved compared to
  people whose plan was changed (20%) (guess)
- contribution of 80k compared to donors (40%)(based on [GiveWell estimate](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/))
- contribution from me as compared to the contribution of my
  replaceable job as say an analyst or an operations person (10%) (
 [GiveWell estimate](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/))
- Contribution to me compared to other employees such as founders
  1.18% (as in assumptions and guesses)
- I estimate the number of lives saved in a my lifetime in my current
  normal job, by donating 15% as 222 lives (derived in the impact
  section of design engineering)
  
  Although I think 10% is a fair number to assume for donations, I
  suspect that with the change in plan based on 80k hours
  intervention, the impact could be atleast 1.5 times than what I
  could have done without 80k hours.
  
- Number of plans changed in a year = 457 on average and is growing
(last 2 years plans changed was >1k)

**The calculation**

- Number of lives saved would thus be: 457*222 lives per year

- Number of lives saved by me per year =  Multiplying by all factors
  with the number of lives saved in total per year= 10 lives
  
- If this grows compounded at 2% with 1% inflation in costs and a 10%
  interest every 5 years for the next 40 years, we get 626 lives.
  
**Reflection on the calculation**

- I feel like I have been heavily hoping for this answer to turn out
  ridiculously large say in k's of people saved. But its 2x more than
  what I could save just being a design engineer. I want to say JUST
  2x more. Nevertheless, I shall use these numbers, conservative as
  they may be.
  
- The numbers produced here seem conservative and very rough, with
  the estimates of my contribution as well as the number of
  plans changed (as we take average and not the current)
  
  Changing the numbers a bit, and making it less conservative, I
  stumble upon another rough estimate of about 2777 lives per
  lifetime per person.
  
  So I would say there is a possibility of saving 600 to 3000 lives
  over the next 40 years for me.
  
- Another estimate of value created in [$ @ GiveWell is $97,900](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) which
  translates to about 1500 lives roughly over 40 years (compounded at
  2% with 1% inflation in costs and a 10% interest every 5 years)
  
- I guess it is more about the ball park or the relatively larger good
  you can do by working in organizations such as GiveWell.
  
##### Calculating the impact of working in design engineering

I estimate the impact of being an engineer as
 - Total donations per annum (20% of 46k$)
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 40
 - Increase in salary = 5% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 12.5% increase
 - = <300
 
 
I estimate the impact of starting up in tech to be
 - Total donations per annum (60% of [2.5m$](https://80000hours.org/2014/05/how-much-do-y-combinator-founders-earn/#fn:5))
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 40
 - Increase in salary = 5% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 12.5% increase
 - ~38k lives
 
## Plan

This post is going to serve as a summary, before I apply to 80k
hours. I see an stm talk about 21k words etc... on his wall.

For me the problem with so many words is having to rewrite the whole thing(not
motivating), 

But I see time and again that he is trying to write a lot. Somehow, for some
reason he belives that writing is everything, or writing helps in solving what
he wants!


### P.S

Working at the library from 8:11 with a small pee break. Set up
markdown mode coloring, figured out how to add comments in markdown mode.
	






## Reflection

Work at a growing organization

Pursue certain graduate studies

Develop valuable transferable skill

Do what contributes to build career capital


Blockchain
## Ideas

Please look at reaching out to the 80k community with this post
regarding the line of thought.

## Log
20 May: established the frame work spent quite a few hours in the library
21 May: Wanked
22 May: 1.5 hrs continuous, no break, of course on a mind level 1k
words
