## Entry question:

What should I be doing career-wise in the coming months with a focus
on maximizing impact over lifetime? By [impact we
mean](/Answers-finale.html) total number of lives saved over a lifetime.

---

## What can I do to create large impact?

According to [80k-hours-career-guide](www.80000hours.org), there seem to be a few
[approaches](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/#top) to having maximum impact. One can either earn-to-give
(ETG), do direct work (DW), and perform advocacy or research. When we
are too unsure about what we want/can do, then we can look into
building flexible-career-capital (FCC), which is building of skills
and knowledge that will be useful in a wide variety of industries over
time, allowing us the freedom to work on pressing problems in the
future.

Earning-to-give needs no explanation. An example of direct work would
be to work for an NGO that stages interventions to help the poor get
back upon their feet, i.e., working directly where needed. Working in
Management consulting (MC) or Data Science (DS) would be a way to keep
building flexible Career Capital (FCC), as these jobs allow you to
become valid in a multitude of industries. The promotion of solutions
to pressing problems is called advocacy; Inspiring/persuading friends
to contribute to pressing problems is an example of advocacy. I don't
plan to discuss advocacy right now in detail. I hope to take it up on
another post at another time as I don't see it having much consequence
for me at this time. Of course, we should do everything we can to get
others to also pursue Effective Altruism (EA).

In the following we attempt to look briefly at the different
approaches to creating impact and some top examples of people who work
in the industry, as featured in the 80k-hours-career-guide.

**A small side note:** This essay heavily relies on the 80k-hours guide. I
have dealt with why we should use the work of 80k hours in the
appendix.

<!-- todo why 80k hours is the shizz -->

### Approach 1: Earning-to-give 

A career in ETG might include one of the following:

- **An investment banker** who will earn in millions and give away >50% of
his salary.

- A **Management Consultant** who will earn > 250k$ and
  give away >30%
  
- A **Data scientist/Project Manager** who will earn 200k$ (in 5-10
  years) and give as much as possible
  
- A **Programmer** who will earn 200k$ and give as much as
  possible

- Taking up **Entrepreneurship** although with very small chance of
  success, has the potential to cause major influence with earning,
  advocacy and direct work.
  
  [Ben West](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/ben-west/) ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentwest/)) an entrepreneur (who was guided by
  80k-hours) is expected to donate millions to charity. He is going to
  keep a minimum wage for himself and donate the rest of his salary. Ben
  West is a fantastic and inspiring example of someone who is going to
  be ETG. There is a lot of luck involved with entrepreneurship, but
  nevertheless, it is the attitude that is at praise here - A person who
  can earn millions saying he will keep minimum wage.

<!-- Amazing, he can even say things like this! -->

### Approach 2: Direct working  

>80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should
>earn to give long term. We think that most people should be doing
>things like politics, policy, high-value research, for-profit and
>non-profit entrepreneurship, and direct work for highly socially
>valuable organizations - [80k-hours-career-guide](https://80000hours.org/)

Most types of DW featured in the 80k-hours-career-guide fall under

- Found &/or Lead or manage Effective Altruism organizations to be
  most impactful. Some inspiring profiles covered by 80k-hours in this
  area of direct work, are below:
  
  [Tara Macaulay](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/tara/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)), was (then) head of operations (now
  CEO) in the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA). Tara has always been
  outstanding at her work, be it with saving money for her company or
  rising the ranks very fast. She has apparently left a lasting impact
  in Bhutan where she worked on direct impact projects. She interned
  without pay at CEA showing great leadership skills and then rose the
  ranks to become the current CEO. She has no MBA degrees and infact
  only has a pharma degree but that hasn't stopped her. The CEA gets a
  lot of funding (in millions) which it directs to worthy applicants
  that can create large impact.

	[Rob Mather](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-mather-b0331235/)), is the CEO of Against Malaria
	foundation (AMF) - critically acclaimed as one of the most
	effective organizations by GiveWell. He has had top education, and
	possibly an all-the-time high achiever who went to Harvard
	Business School and University of Cambridge. The AMF saves
	millions of lives a year, I repeat millions.

	[David Goldberg](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/david-goldberg/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjonathangoldberg/)), co-founder of Founders Pledge,
	that makes Tech entrepreneurs legally bound to donate in case their
	startups succeed. He is definitely another all-the-time high achiever,
	who went to Cambridge, but has a degree in philosophy. He has done
	everything other than continuing with philosophy.

	>Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance in the US, started
	>and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
	>in California. All in, a pretty bizarre career trajectory if I’m
	>honest, which was largely the result of having no clear idea of what
	>I wanted to do with my life until recently.

	But now he has focused all of his might into the Founders Pledge to
	create high impact.

  <!-- Seems to be a scope to intern at these places (seems to be -->
  <!--       working based on availability) -->


- Be an Analyst/researcher at Effective Altruism Organizations (EAOs)
   such as GiveWell or 80000hours

	In organizations like GiveWell, 80k-hours, Centre for Effective
	Altruism (CEA) etc... they need people to write useful content in
	an understandable way and they need people to research what
	programs are effective and most impactful. In other words, solving
	problems with limited data, knowing what type of data is
	interesting, and presenting it in clear manner, is done by
	analysts or researchers. Here the main criteria are strong
	critical thinking skills, statistics and Mathematics. Most of the
	EAO's have very few people (10-30), the top members creating
	impact in the order of millions of dollars. As an beginner analyst
	you could already [make an impact of 97k$ a year](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/). 

- Working in Policy

	This involves shaping the policy of governments to impact a
	population of a city, state, country or world. For example, an
	Economics PhD working with the government, will [sometimes have
	the chance to impact a large population](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) by influencing policy
	based on logic and numbers. Although these chances are rare an
	Economics Phd is still considered [one of the best PhD's to
	pursue](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/economics-phd/) (I guess owing to the impact).

	[Niel Bowerman ](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/niel-bowerman/) ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielbowerman/)), previously the Assistant Director
	of Future of Humanity Institute, studied at Oxford University,
	is another outstanding talent featured in the 80k-hours website. He
	does not have an MBA, he is a physics major, previously handling
	fundraising, operations management etc... And now he is the head of AI
	policy for 80k-hours. With this he is able to guide potential
	candidates in the right direction to assist in mitigating the [risks
	of AI](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/) through policy.

### Approach 3: Advocacy

Advocacy is the promotion of solutions to pressing problems leading to
impact. A simple form of advocacy, is when you convince your friend
about ETG. By doing this you increase your impact even more.

>The second path does more good – in fact probably about twice as much
>– and this illustrates the power of advocacy.

### Approach 4: Building career capital

Career Capital (CC) broadly talks about the skills, connections,
credentials and runway to allow for us to take on high impact tasks
later. The greater the CC the better, roughly speaking. Better skills
roughly translates to better output, more chance of learning and even
more chance of making a lot of impact. In Sales, the more you sell the
more the money you take home. The better your sales skills are, the
better you are able to make more money, which can be in turn donated
to make maximum impact.

When we are young and we don't know what problem we should be working
on or where we can create a lot of impact, flexible career capital
(FCC) comes in handy then.

>flexible – useful in many different types of jobs, and likely to
>remain useful in the future. For instance, learning marketing or
>management is flexible because almost all organisations need these
>skills; -[80k hours on Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

In an attempt to keep options open for us
to move to the problem we can best address later, we should consider
FCC. For example, if one does an MBA and goes into management
consulting for the next few years, the exit opportunities are
aplenty. A management consultant after a few years of work has wide
scope for working in different industries and in different positions
of choice, in some cases there is scope for direct work, and in others
one can even become partner and donate a lot of money for the rest of
his life to make the best impact. FCC is something that does not take
you to a dead end. For example,

>It’s widely accepted in the non-profit sector that it’s easier to
>switch from a business job to a non-profit job than vice versa. So if
>you’re unsure between the two, a business position offers more
>flexibility.

So jobs, that will continue to be useful in different industries and
likely to remain useful in the future. Jobs that allow you to gain
skill that can later be transferred to other jobs are the types of
work we should be interested in early career I guess.

[Dillon Bowen](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/dillon-bowen/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dillon-bowen-409791a1/)) is working towards his Economics PhD
based on the counseling he got from 80k-hours-career-guide. Economics
PhD is highly recommended graduate program by 80k-hours-career-guide,
due to the high impact in direct working. Such a PhD allows for jobs
in academia (which have a unique way of doing DW), you can go into
Management Consulting, or you can join the government and work in
policy. So it allows you the CC to decide later to either ETG, DW in
policy or do research in academia.

 <!-- TBW, He has no MBA, as a result. -->

[Peter Huford](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/peter-hurford/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhurford8/)), taught himself how to program from a
political science background that now, he is improving his skills in
business, programming and finance and is also having extra time to work
on other charity projects. Peter seems to be a great example of one
who is building great FCC.


  <!-- * [ ] Appears that I should follow something like this, and talk to -->
  <!--       Herman maybe, as the spending time on an MBA to do some IB is -->
  <!--       not really seeming to be required. A better understanding or -->
  <!--       working or creation of new things can increase the outcome 10 -->
  <!--       fold in no time. I think I should just focus on things like -->
  <!--       this and get better and become really skillful. -->



<!-- fix the above -->


### Summary

The importance of direct work has been stressed a lot by 80k-hours. In
the long run that is what I guess I should be doing. But for the next
few years, no harm in making money as well as building career
capital. But money is not the objective, getting oneself in shape to
do good is; Gaining skills to make crazy impact is. The different
examples of people creating their best impact shows us what is
possible and how reasonable to keep the expectations, I guess. I would
like to be like these people, high-achieving and high-impact-causing.

I need to be evaluating the different options available, and come up
with where I can make the most impact based on the different paths
that I take, considering the success and failure probabilities. The
next section attempts to identify potential careers and review them
considering my personal fit.

## Finding the right career for you

Based on [the 80k-hours guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/) we first make a list of options,
then compare it with different parameters and at last write out our
key uncertainities and look at how to deal with them.

<!-- Making a list of options -->

- **We make a list of options** by using these questions: What do you
want to do in life? Provide exact examples of profiles that you would
like to be like? What are the different career paths you think are
available to you? Give one way how you would achieve it? These have in
part been done in the last section and will be factored in.

<!-- Rankingish your options --> 

- **We compare different options** based on Career Capital (Skills, Connections,
Credentials, Runway), Personal fit, job satisfaction and impact.

<!-- Write out key uncertainities -->

- **We write out your key uncertainities:** What are the things that you
are uncertain about? Can you quickly test them? Are they going to
change your ranking largely?

Making a list according to 80k-hours sounds far-too-specific like
"economics researcher focusing on global health", "marketing for meat
substitutes" etc... I am currently looking to build FCC. I also need
to consider if the FCC allows me to do lot of impact in the future. I
have no idea on what exact problem I would like to work on or I would
best fit in. So, the focus is on the choice of direction for **the
next few years**.

### Career Quiz: recommended list of careers

The [80k-hours career guide has a career-quiz](https://80000hours.org/career-quiz/#/) of 6 questions based
on which you get a few career recommendations.

**The Career Q&A**

1. Could you become good at math, science or logic?
Yes (outperform 80% of graduates)

2. Could you become good at writing and speaking? 
Yes (Outperforming 80% of graduates in a humanities subject)

3. Are you happy betting on a small chance of a big impact?
No

4. Are you happy trying to work in the most demanding fields?
Yes

Challenging and long hours should not be a problem I suppose. I have
seen evidences of this in my past, with my master thesis(10-14 hrs a
day, programming, reading), with my work in IIT Madras (easily clocked
10 hrs or more a day for 1 year atleast), Courses in my masters
etc... and for a few months worked on writing on the blog and
researching at home  5) How far through your career are you?

Early (27) finished masters and working for ~2 years

6. How do you want to contribute? 

All possible ways: Direct, indirect, earning to give, research etc...

**And the output is:**

- Policy oriented Civil services
- Economics PhD
- Data Science (skill building and earning to give)
- Working at effective non-profites
- Machine learning PhD
- Software engineering (skill building and earning to give)
- Trading in quantitative hedge funds

When we are ready to bet on small chances then the output changes to:

- Congressional staffer
- Policy oriented Civil services
- Machine learning PhD
- Working at effective Altruist organizations
- Founding effective non-profits
- Data science
- Party politics

In addition to the above, I also would like to evaluate the current job I
am working at now, difference between working at the US and in
Netherlands, and if the career can somehow lead to Direct Work.

### Comparing

The following parameters are used to compare each career path:
	
- Career Capital
  - Skills
  - Connections 
  - Credentials
  - Career Capital

- Personal Fit

- Job satisfaction or supportive conditions

- Impact

Following this, I could use the decision making chart and the decision
tool of the 80k-hours website to do the same to determine the result.

### Career Capital

Skills:

>Skills – what will you learn in this job, and how fast will you
>learn? You can break skills down into transferable skills, knowledge
>and personality traits. Some especially useful transferable skills
>include: personal productivity, analysis and problem-solving, the
>ability to learn quickly, decision-making, social skills, and
>management. We cover why and how to learn them in a later article. If
>you want to do good, you also need to learn all about the world’s
>most pressing problems and how to solve them. A job will be best for
>learning when you are pushed to improve and get lots of feedback from
>mentors. - [80k hours Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

The current plan is to focus on FCC.

Will the job allow me FCC? 

Will it give me important skills like programming, Data-science which
can be transferred over a wide variety of industries.

Connections:

>Connections – who will you work with and meet in this job? Your
>connections are how you’ll find opportunities, spread ideas and start
>new projects. The people you spend time with also shape your
>character. For both reasons, it’s important to make connections who
>are influential and who care about social impact. - [80k hours Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

Are my connections going to get me jobs in different industries or
other industries?

Are my connections going to inspire me to do good?

Are my connections influential?

Credentials:

> Will this job act as a good signal to future collaborators or
> employers? Note that we don’t just mean formal credentials like
> having a law degree, but also your achievements and reputation. If
> you’re a writer, it’s the quality of your blog. If you’re a coder,
> it’s your GitHub. -[80k hours Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

Runway:

>how much money will you save in this job? Your runway is how long you
>could comfortably live with no income. It depends on both your
>savings and how much you could reduce your expenses by. We recommend
>aiming for at least six months of runway to maintain your financial
>security. 12-18 months of runway is even more useful because it gives
>you the flexibility to make a major career change. It’s usually worth
>paying down high-interest debt before donating more than 1% per year
>or taking a big pay cut for greater impact. -[80k hours Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

Ability to quickly save enough money for the next 18 months is what
seems to be defining runway. How much I can donate is a question
answerd by the impact section. Runway seems to be always important.


### Impact

Number of lives saved is the ultimate variable we are interested
in.

In order to determine the effective impact of pursuing a career, we
should do more than just multiply the impact with the personal fit. We
should look at it like a decision tree. If we succeed our impact is
say X. If we fail our impact will be Y. Therefore,

Effective impact = Personal fit x X + (1-Personal fit) x Y

### Supportive conditions

- Engaging work
- Colleagues
- Basic needs
- fit with rest of life

> Impact and personal life Engaging work - Will you get freedom to
> decide how to work, clear tasks, clear feedback and variety in what
> you do?  Colleagues- Will you like them and will they support you?
> basic needs- Will you earn enough money, will the hours be
> manageable, and will the commute be reasonable?  Fit with rest of
> your life -– Will you be able to improve your personal
> relationships, and uphold any other important personal priorities?
> -[80k hours Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

### Personal Fit

What are your chances of excelling in that area?

### In total

	$ (f1 x Career Capital +f2 x Impact +f3 x supportive conditions) *
	Personal fit
 
>If you are still early in your career, then it’s best to place
>greater importance on career capital than on role impact

>The more uncertain you are about the long-run, the more you should
>prioritise flexible career capital over

>The more altruistically-minded you are, the less weight you’ll need
>to place on job satisfaction relative to the other factors.

80k suggests role-impact and not impact. This would mean that I
somehow have an idea of what problem I have chosen to focus on. On a
high level, it is all about saving lives, adding good years to lives
around the world now and later.

To simplify the solving of the above problem, I suggest we just stick
to impact as being saving lives. I will try to make estimations of
saving lives with this. The value of these factors are explained later.

[Source: how to compare different careers ](https://80000hours.org/articles/framework/#questions-for-assessing-each-factor) 

Instead of rejecting a low-personal-fit-high-impact career, what if we
took it and played our chances. In case we win, we gain huge impact, if
we loose, we can pick still make decent effort.


	Effective impact = Personal fit x X + (1-Personal fit) x Y

So we will look at Effective impact.

## Evaluating different profiles

With this section I hope to take each career path, and evaluate it
based on the parameters from the last section. In the end I would have
a table for different career paths in the rows and the parameters in
the columns. For each of the parameters, I come up with a number
usually from 1-10, based on the points I make in favor of or against
the career path.


### Design engineering for ETG

I am currently a Design Engineer in the precision industry. The
function of such an engineer is to design parts/products to the
specifications provided, verify and assemble them.  Here the following
cases are evaluated in this profile:

- Design Engineering in NL/Europe
- Design Engineering in US
- Design Engineering to Sales in NL

<!-- going to the US with DE might be possible but I suspec only with -->
<!-- L1 I will make a separate post out of it -->

**Skills**:

- Not very challenging all the time, not pushed to do more and given
  only a small amount of feedback.

I work for ~40 hrs a week in NL and I am barely at any pressure or
pushed to achieve great things. Learning in general is slow. I suspect
that there will be more pressure in the US or if I move to Sales, but
there is a lot of paper work to do in general, in addition to the lack
of challenging problems given to you for solving

- Small percentage of critical thinking

Critical thinking is about 20-30% of the time . Most of the time I am
not working on hard problems. I am doing a lot of work that does not
translate necessarily to improvement of my skill such as making small
modifications to existing setups, or covering for poor procedures
written by others.

- Not very valuable even with 30 years of experience

>For the first five to ten years in this position, salary increases
>somewhat, but any additional experience does not have a big effect on
>pay. - [payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Design_Engineer/Salary)

- Decent transferable skills

I will have quite some knowledge of the Semicon industry, maybe a good
chance to port to Sales, So I think it does offer some sort of FCC
(flexible Career capital). Even within the company I work for they
were looking for normal people to shift to management side provided
they had a few years of experience. I have seen the useless nutheads
in sales who do not understand the product and have no idea what it
can do, still pitch it to others and try to make a sale. I think I
would be a welcome relief to such an industry needing solid engineers
who can also talk.

Although I am not sure of why going into automotive or space might be
interesting, moving to other such industries might be hard or
impossible. I have seen people move from other industries to precision
engineering, but not the other way around. I suspect going the other
way might need a lot of pre-knowledge, and current knowledge might
just not be fully portable. So I will have to stay in Precision
engineering for ever. With regard to ETG, I don't see it as a big problem.

This job is usually not intense and has a long development cycle, so
work hours are not too long, allowing us time to learn other things
and improve in the areas needed. But learning more about design seems
to only come with more experience in the field, rather than reading
about things.

I don't expect the resulting skills to be very much different between
here and the US. A decent amount of transferable skills, the minimum
quantity of critical thinking, a decent amount of creativity while
working seems to result in a skill rating of 6.5/10.

**Connections**:

I work with other design engineers and physicists in the job. I might
be able to find opportunities in related fields using these
contacts. As I am mostly working with only my team, it doesn't give me
opportunities to meet top players in the industry. As a result  the
connection rating is at 4/10.

**Credentials**:

For a writer it is his blog, for a coder it is his Github, for a
mechanical deisgner, it is his portfolio of work done till now,which
would help find other jobs in the same industry. Jumping jobs is
sometimes the best way to get a raise. I see myself growing up the
ladder very very slowly (4-5 years per promotion). It is a slow
working environment (mainly because of the long development
cycles). Right now maybe I can boast to future precision companies
regarding what I do at my current employer. Moving within the
precision engineering industry should not be a problem, but I think it
stops with that. I would put DE at a rating of 6/10 for credentials.

**Runway**:

I can't move immediately into sales or even to the US. The runway for
all the cases will correspond to what I earn at DE in NL. It is
estimated for 18months worth of dough, 2-3 years of saving is
required. An average rating of 5/10 is given here.

<!-- Ways of moving to the US and prolty estimates unknown, but runway -->
<!-- could be crazy, but I still suspect I need to clock a few good -->
<!-- years here before I am able to migrate reasonably-->

**Personal Fit**:

To excel in this area would mean, 

- I can be a typical engineer for the rest of my life and grow through
  the ranks slowly. This is like the minimum I should be able to
  achieve at any cost. I estimate this at 95% chance of success for
  me.
  
- There seems to be a decent opportunity into sales. But is sales a
good fit for me? I suspect I can be good at it. I have seen random
people move into sales and succeed. My cousin was an ordinary
Mechanical Engineer who rose the ranks in sales and now ears lots of
money in Dubai. Another cousin moved from electrical engineering
(brainy guy though) and managed a killer career that got him to a US
green card directly. Considering that Sales can make more money, I
should atleast try a brief stint in it. I can always fall back to DE
as and when I like. I expect the chance of success to be 75%.

- Moving to the US

  There are a couple of ways I go to the US, either by direct applying
  or by migrating from one country to the other via an L1 visa.  <!--
  Also possibly go to Canada and follow the L1 route --> In 5 years
  time I would expect to have worthy experience with which I can try
  for a switch to the US. By then I would have an NL Citizenship and
  if things don't work out in the US, I can always fall back into
  holland and do what I do.
  
  - Chance of becoming really good in DE (80%)
  - Chance of managing an L1 or getting selected directly (60%)
          
So in total: 80%*60% = 48% of success.

**Impact**:


>Most people move on to other jobs if they have more than 20 years'
>experience in this career. Experience has a moderate effect on pay
>for this job.- [Payscale-mechanical-engineering](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Engineer/Salary)

- The impact of being a typical engineer for the next 40 years in NL is
estimated to be ~200 lives based on:

	- Salary raise of 4% per year for the next 40 years
	- 10% increase every 5 years
	- 20% donation
	- increase of 2%/year on the cost of lives
	- beginners salary of 53k$

- The impact of moving into sales can probably significantly switch
things up, conservatively I guesstimate it at atleast 2 times the
impact of full time DE. Yes I am pulling these numbers almost out of
my ass, as I don't have good estimates of it. I will refine this
number later if needed. Resulting in 400 lives.

- The impact of moving to the US could be much better as the pay is
reasonably higher.

	- Salary raise of 4% per year
	- 10% increase every 5 years
	- 20% donation
	- increase of 2%/year on the cost of lives
	- for a beginners salary of 100k
	- 2% increase in salary from 50 years of age
  
280 lives in the US for 35 years + 13 lives for the first 5 years in
NL = ~300 lives.

**Personal fit x Impact**

- DE in NL

		95% x 200 = 190

This is the minimum I can do and so the rest of the 7% wouldn't
matter. 

- DE followed by sales

I can briefly try sales and if all hell brakes loose then I can always
move back in DE. Considering such a tree we get:
		
		75% x 400 = 300	
		75% x 400 + 25% x 95% x 200 ~= 350 
		
- DE in US

Just like in sales, I can always move back to being a DE in Nl. 
		
		48% x 300 = 144
		48% x 300 + 52% x 95% x 200 ~= 248


**Conclusion DE ETG**

With the above calculations we see that DE in NL might be better than
DE in US if we do not consider the decision tree, but if we do
consider the decision tree, it turns out that trying it would still be
better than just being a DE in NL.

We could make the Decision tree even more complicated, with many
branches etc... to work out other situations. But for now, it appears
that trying Sales and US options could be good options to get myself
into, as opposed to a traditional job.

### Design engineering (Machine Design) in 'Europe' for Direct work

**Skills**: 

- Lot of skills not useful in DW

	Right now I am learning a very specific amount of skills. Skills
	related to making proper drawings, how to design for the precision
	industry, how to keep things simple etc... Great for the precision
	engineering market but I dont think it preps me for the Leadership
	or research type of jobs that would be needed in DW.

- gaining management skills takes a long while before it even begins

	Even if I become a design leader (as they call it here), it would
	take say 5-8 years atleast (35), where I go into a tech leadership
	kinds of role, where I am managing a technical team, knowing on a
	high level what my team is doing.

- Not very challenging all the time, not pushed to do more or given a
lot of feedback

	I have already talked about this in the last section on 'DE for
	ETG'.  As an engineer I have to do a lot of unnecessary things,
	kind a like doing experiments manually. Time is really precious
	and you would want every single minute to count. I see myself
	'wasting' a lot of time here. I work for <40 hrs a week and I am
	barely at any pressure or pushed to achieve great things.

Overall, the dearth of transferable skills, minimum time spent on
critical thinking and a decent amount of creativity building gets it a
rating of 5/10.

**Connections**:

AS mentioned in 'DE for ETG', connections within the industry are
already not that great. Connections to move to DW or meeting people
interested in EA, is hard I observe. Thus rated as 3/10. 

**Credentials**:

Credentials wise I am very limited. The assignments given to me and
available in general don't allow you to boast crazy performance boosts
or high impact. I think I will not be able to boast any reasonable
achievements, other than my performance reviews, that can look good on
my application to GiveWell type EAOs. So I rate this at 5/10.

**Runway**:

In Netherlands I can save about 6-8k euros per year. Removing my
donation, and all other extra expenses that seem to be coming, I think
I can save about 6k per year. I can improve this if necessary by
4k/year by joining another company. Runway gathering takes a slow 3
years for saving for 18 months worth. An average rating of 5/10 is
given here.

**Supporting conditions**

Work is engaging, I can always find decent challenges. Basic needs are
met, colleagues seem to be fine and ready to help when you ask for
help. Work outside of DE towards the Direct Work can also be quite
engaging.

It is hard to find like minded people here who share any interest in
Altruism. Of all the people I have met, I do not know a single soul
who does anything related to EA. They are too busy chilling, going to
the beach, working and planning on pleasurable activities after
activities. 

<!-- Not that I am any great soul or something; Well ;)-->

**Personal Fit**:

To excel in this area would mean to somehow gain skills to
either found an NGO, or work in one in operations or research.

- chances of learning skills at the age of 33 within design
  engineering (85%)
- possibility of learning the right skills while spending time in this
  industry (70%)
  
  This is assuming I can learn in my ample available free time (14-22
  hrs).
  
- Getting a job in either research or management in top NGO's
  based on research or operations related credentials (70%)
  
  I don't expect it to be as tough as getting a job in MC. Plus I have
  quite some spare time on my hand. I could always look to improve my
  knowledge and skills. I would have 40 days of vacation every year,
  which I could really use to become better or even take internships.

So a total 42% chance of success.

**Impact**:

It is argued in the appendix that impact of working in an EAO is
estimated at >970 lives when we work for 40 years. That becomes: 

- 23 lives over the first 9 years in DE
- 970*7/8 if I work in the EAO for the next 35 years.
- total: 875 lives



**Personal fit x Impact**

Simply multiplying the personal fit and the impact.

	42% x 875 = 380
	
In case EAO doesn't work out we can always move back to 'DE in NL'

	42% x 875 + 58% x 95% x 200 = 480 

**Conclusion DE for DW**

With the intention of doing Direct Work, it still seems
alright. I don't think it gives me any special skills but it
gives me time (22hrs a week on avg), a citizenship, sabbatical leave
with which I can slowly and meticulously plot my way out of DE to
Direct work.

### Data science 

With this section Data science (DS) is discussed in the following way:

- DS for direct Work
- DS for ETG in the NL
- DS for ETG in the US

**Skills**

- Nice set of skills for research and maybe management

Statistics, critical thinking, programming and machine learning could
be the knowledge and skills I would transfer to research based jobs,
and not necessarily leadership based jobs. However I suspect that a
role in project management after a few years could get me somewhere
like an all-rounder in the field of DS.

- High Flexible Career Capital according to 80k-hours-guide

>The technical skills you develop also open the possibility to
>transition into different roles including software engineering,
>founding or joining early-stage startups, academia, and quant
>finance. - [80k-DS](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/) 

DS is used in a many industries, including EA, offering FCC. Also DS
is only the starting point. Skills wise it looks like a great place to
start, with little effort. With very good skill I could move to NGO's (Direct impact potential)
as well. 

- Free time to develop additional skills

Once I start DS I suspect I have quite some time to do programming,
using different languages and focus on some high-risk paths like
starting up or even a machine learning PhD. Even if I am in the US,
working time is apparently ([reasonable and flexible hours](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/)).

- More valuable with more experience.
 
A good rating of 8/10 seems to be applicable for DS considering the
skills aspect.

**Connections**

Connections depends on where I am working and which type of company I
will be working for. For example working in a consultancy, might have
a great chance to meet many people and building the network. The
network as a result would be better than in DE. 

- Connections that further NGO opportunities: 4.5/10

- Connections that further DS in NL for earning to give: 5.5/10

- Connections that further DS in US for earning to give: 5.5/10

**Credentials**

DS has a fast paced scene, I gather from 80k-hours-guide. Faster
feedback cycle, and large connection between work and outcomes can be
felt. Further impression I get is that there it will be easy to obtain
bragable credentials. My belief that DS will give good credentials
combined with an uncertainty, leaves it at a rating of 7.5/10.

**Runway** 

DS in NL probably starts with a slightly higher salary than DE based
on estimates from Payscale DS's seem to earn ([46k€](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/05582c7c/Amsterdam) and design
engineers [40k€](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Design_Engineer/Salary)). This implies a faster runway than DE. DS in US
allows a more faster collection of the runway for 18 months. But in
any case right now it appears I will have to work in NL and slowly
plot my travel towards US or NGO's. So I suspect it to take about 2
years. So I will give it 7/10/

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

- For the most part it is engaging
- Cleaning up the data will be boring, it takes up a lot of time.
- Basic needs will be satisfied (money, hours and commute)
- Am not worried I will have too many problems learning or fitting in,
  my point being it is not investment banking.
- Again I look up to people in the US like my brother and other actual
  data scientists, they seem to have time to do other things as
  well. Not like they are working 24x7. Also 80k suggests that the
  hours are moderate 50 hrs per week I think. This is peacefully
  doable.
  
- Also this is expected to be a very satisfying career according to
  80k, due to the fast feedback cycle.

-Mentorship culture is quite common apparently according to 80k.

- project management could be even more fulfilling as it has more
control, more responsibility than analysts who are just the right hand
for project managers<!-- , just like my DL in DE -->.

It looks good overall, thus with a rating of 8/10.
  
**Personal fit**

Companies like KLM even have jobs for engineers and data
scientists. This could be quite lucrative for me and for the company,
as I span both the spectra. Anyone can jump into data science (we are
not talking about data core or machine learning). I have seen
colleagues of mine who were doing a masters with me and moved into
DS. The skills are basically stats, programming in python, R and SQL.
So personal fit wise, it is good here.

I am a fast learner and have worked on proper programming assignments
before. I have done a fair bit of critical thinking, hypothesis
forming and solving problems at work and my masters. I love it to
begin with and I think there is a lot of room to get better and I can
get better at it, with more defined ways of thinking.

I am up for challenging jobs all the time. I love programming and can
spend like any other sane human being a very large time working on it.

- DS as a means of earning to give (Netherlands)
  
  Here success would mean moving to a job in DS in NL from DE. This is
  to be followed by 40 years of work, with 20% of donations every
  year.
  
  I know a few of my colleagues who are in DS right out of a similar
  masters degree as I. Plus from everything I have seen it is a
  learn-able skill, and appears to be definitely learn-able.
  
  - 95% chance of entering into DS
  - 93% chance of working 40 years with 20% donations
  - In total, 88% chance of success
  
- DS as a means of earning to give (US)

  The career should probably look like this: I should be able to get
  jobs in europe within Google or Facebook and slowly plot my
  migration. I could also do a one year masters for example to move to
  the US.
  
  - Getting US worthy skills in 5 years time (80%)
  - Getting an L1 (65%) (This is a guess factoring uncertainty)
  - So in total: 95%x80%x65% = 47% of success.

- DS in NGO's

With good stats and quants capability, I think we might have a good
fit in analyst roles. There are also NGO's which use DS to do good,
like khan academy etc... If I spend enough time, I could already
manage a team and gain more FCC. So personally after 4-5 years (10k
hours of skill development) I suspect I should be quite
valuable.

- Chance to get into an NGO after 5 years in the realm of DS = 80%

Total chance = 95%*80% = 76%

**Impact**

DS in top companies seems to be earning people top dollars.  My friend
in the US earns 130-170k $ in Apple. Once you are Apple worthy, there
seems to be a lot of potential scope and growth. I have also heard the
pays in Facebook sometimes being about 200k $ with a few years of
experience. A simple bachelor's student in California in Data science
from a Waterloo university earns a base salary of 100k + stocks of 30k
a year. As far as I checked glassdoor and payscale, the pay in
Netherlands also seems to be higher than in DE. According to payscale
DS's seem to earn[ 53k](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/05582c7c/Amsterdam) and design engineers [40k](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Design_Engineer/Salary) €. Not able
to get proper estimates on glassdoor, but it looks high. Also DS is
heavily hyped by 80k-hours for its ability to quickly transform into
ETG.

>Data Incubator reports that its graduates can get starting salaries
>of $100K to $200K.

Bootcamps could be an option for me but I think some info that is
missing is that these people who succeed are not ordinary people. The
interview process itself is rigorous to get into, with these
bootcamps. But with skill it is possible to get lot of money for
ETG. Skills can be learned with time. I am not able to scoop it out
but, last time I saw on glassdoor, you are more valuable with
experience.

There is a lot of scope for direct impact if one has skills, by using
this science in companies like:

>the Center for Disease Control, Google, Khan Academy, Bayes Impact
>and DataKind.


- Working for DS now and staying in NL/europe for the next 40 years

	- With salary growth of 4% a year
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- and 20% donation
	- for a beginners salary of [53k from Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/05582c7c/Amsterdam)€ 
	
237 lives.

- Working for DS for the next 5 years and moving to the US

	- With compound interest of 4% a year
	- increase in salary of 2% after age 50
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- and 20% donation
	- for a beginners salary of 130k (based on salary of Bachelor's
      student from waterloo university in DS working at Facebook)
	  
	
367 lives for 35 years in the US + ~13 lives for the first 5 years in
NL= 400 lives.

- Working for DS now and moving to an NGO within the next 5 years.

I assume the same impact irrespective of the NGO joined. By definition
an NGO worth joining is for sure recommended by 80k-hours for example.
So my impact will be close to 970 lives.

**Personal fit x Impact**

- DS in NL


		88% x 237 = 208

In case DS fails I can always go back into DE.

		88% x 237 + 12% x 95% x 200 = 231
	
- DS in US 

	
		47% x 400 = 188

	In case DS in US fails I will try DS in NL and if that fails as
	well it would be DE in NL

		47% x 400 + 53% x (231) = 310

- DS in the pursuit of EAO

		76% x 970 = 738
	
	In case this fails, I can always fall back and pursue DS in NL.
	
		76% x 970 + 24% x (231) = 793
		
**Conclusion for DS**

DS in EAO is most lucrative if the numbers are right. This is
something that I should work on ensuring as this is turning out to be
a lucrative and promising career. DS in general is very good for CC as
well.

### MBA into Management consulting

Finishing an MBA allows travel into a couple of venues, of which one
of them is MC. 80k-hours has done a [complete career profile on
them](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/). Based on [MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/), it appears that an MC does
just about anything that is needed to be done to improve the
performance of a company. The impression I get is that you are given
challenging problems and you have to come up with solutions for it.
Every few months you work on a new problem in teams and come up with a
solution.

**Skills**

Management consulting is hyped by 80k for its [career
capital](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/). They seem to offer sufficient transferable skills. You
actually work on different problems and become a generalist in an
industry with quite some exit opportunities:

>You can work in an industry you served as a consultant, venture
>capital, private equity, policy/civil service, work on a “strategy
>team” for a company. [Career Capital 80k-hours](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/)

You can pretty much do a lot with such exit opportunities. 

>Although a significant portion of your time will be spent on
>preparing powerpoint presentations, email, and “grunt” tasks, such as
>creating databases, junior consultants gain responsibility relatively
>quickly, and work on solving challenging business problems.

We spend more time and effort in this career and it appears to be
filled with great things in terms of CC such as learning, growth,
mentorship and regular feedback and working on tough problems to grow
along with the top performing peers. 80k hours values MC > DS
comparing career capital. These skills I am not sure I can gain say if
I work by myself at home. We rate it 10/10.

**Connections**

>An interviewee mentioned that the quality of the colleagues is
>generally seen as a major benefit of the job. Other alumni of the
>firm and contacts from individual projects give consultants a large
>number of valuable business contacts.

MC is all about consulting for big companies. You constantly have to
travel and meet with clients and deliver for them in their
locations. Projects are 2-3 months short and you have scope to get
lots of connections. Also, your colleagues around you are also
high-achievers and could be very valuable.

So I present this with 9/10. It seems like it is far apart from
anything I have seen before in either DS or DE. DS is also supposed to
be good connections. But I will say this, if MC's are the top
performers, if almost everyone can become Data Scientists, if MCs earn
more than DSs, if MC's connections are highly talked about by
80k-hours, if you know and work with your peers who are brilliant,
then MC seems to be much better than DS in terms of connections. OK I
will settle with an 8/10 considering DS is at 5.

**Credentials**

I think with MC you will make good credentials as you are solving
problems after problems in short time for the top 500. The exit
opportunities look aplenty, so I guess just knowing this is good
enough. Based on these I will put it slightly above DS.  8/10.

**Runway**

MC's earn [30-50% of what IB's earn](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/). At the associate level you
earn 80k to 170k. This would probably allow you to donate in the 30%
brackets. It should give enough runway right in the first year I think
assuming I do not have any more loans and shit. Runway is not
something I would be worried about if I was a Management consultant as
I would earning a 100k+ salary atleast.

For the next few years the time to accumulate runway will be the same
as for the job in DE in NL, which will result in 18 months.

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

There is good feedback and training. Job satisfaction appears to be
decent considering the challenging atmosphere and variety in work. I
am not sure 60 hour work days are really very bad. I think I can
manage it for a few years atleast. Also this is not as bad as in other
sectors like Finance. Even if things go wrong, if we try to sweat a
few years we can cash in on the exit opportunities as
possible. Support conditions are a bit weaker than in DS or DE. I will
keep it at a 7 as compared to 8 from DS.

**Exit opportunities**

If MC turns out to be not for you after a few years, then MC seems to
have decent exit opportunities. People move on to do various things,
not exactly like a demotion.

- Move to industry that you worked as a consultant 

>You can generally advance more quickly in industry by starting in
>consulting then entering industry several years later.

- policy/civil service but not sure how age plays a factor.
- VC / PE, If I can't handle MC and go to PE, then why will I choose
  PE, which seems to be even more demanding, depending on where you
  join.

**Personal fit**

- Earning to give

  - Chances of clearing getting >730 in GMAT (70%)
  - Chances of clearing the scholarship criteria for RSM after
    getting 730 (60%).
	
	I am not sure I have reasonable achievements for this and a
	serious lack of time to develop big achievements. But with a nice
	story on the CV and a good Recommendation maybe it is still
	possible.
	
  - MC jobs are highly competitive and 80k-hours-guide suggest to
    attach a 50% probability with it with getting a job once you
    graduate.
	
  - Chances of staying within MC >5 years (60%)
  - Chances that I will deal with 60 hrs of work (85%)
  
  - There is a[ 1/8th chance of making it to partner](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/#job-satisfaction)(12.5%) by age
    45, which brings down the personal fit quite a bit.
    
  So a total of : 1.3% 
  
- Earning to give once we leave industry after 5 years (ETG taking the
  exit opportunities in MC)
  
  - Similar chances as above still apply.
  - Chance of clearing GMAT and getting a scholarship still make sense
    (42%)
  - Chance of getting the top MC job (50%)
  - Chance of getting a job that is paying similar to DS (70%)
  
  >You can generally advance more quickly in industry by starting in
  >consulting then entering industry several years later

  If I was able to come this far, I assume from there on it is easy to
  get a job and advance more quickly in the industry. I don't know how
  much I can earn, but I suspect it is atleast around 150k, which is
  like a normal salary in the US. All the big heads in big companies
  like Apple, Microsoft, Google are MBA degree holders. So push
  further, work hard and see where it takes us. Hence the probability
  of 70%.
  
 - In total 18.9%

- Working for an NGO after 3-5 years in MC

	I am not comeacross a wide variety of opportunities. Nor has
	80k-hours-mentioned Direct work exit opportunities. There are some
	chances of working say at the Gates Foundation or other NGO's. But
	it is barely clear how this would pan out or how an MC job would
	help in this case especially. The impact could be pretty high if
	we are able to work at NGO's like Gates foundation.

	So the chances pan out to be I think

  - Similar chances as above still apply.
  - Chance of clearing GMAT and getting a scholarship still make sense
    (42%)
  - Chance of getting the top MC job (50%)
  - Chance of getting into a the likes of Gates Foundation (70%)
  - In total it is 18.9%.

**Impact**

- [Earning to give (partner after 45)](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/#job-satisfaction)

	- At associate level we get 130k 
	- after 5 years 250k
	- after 7 years 450k
	- 600k + bonus after 7 more years say
	- Donating 40% ([Like this](https://qz.com/515655/this-couple-lives-on-6-of-their-income-so-they-can-give-100000-a-year-to-charity/) maybe)
	- inflation of 2%
	- retiring at 57
	- getting 75% last drawn for the rest of life (another 20 years
      atleast)
	- I didn't take into account the bonuses which is expected to be a
      lot more.

	We can expect to save upwards of 1250 lives

- Earning to give, once we leave MC in 5 years

	- With salary growth of 4% a year
	- 2% salary growth after 50
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- and 30% donation
	- for a beginners salary of 150k (assumption i.e., after quitting
      MC)
	  
  This gives about 635 lives + first years at MC gives 70 lives = 700  <!-- one thing I am not confident about
  is at the age of 40 I should be earning in millions, is that even
  possible? Raaam? rajesh -->

- Direct working potential

I assume the impact for now to be the same for all EAOs, including the
ones that might be relevant to MC. This brings us to 970 lives i.e.,
35 years of working in an EAO + ETG as an MC for the first few years.

**Personal Fit x Impact**

- MC with a focus on becoming partner

The decision tree with MC is tabulated above. The thing is I can try
for GMAT and Scholarship. It would cost me a year. I estimate the
chances as per earlier in the discussion of personal fit. I expect
that if I fail in a year then I already know that this is not for me
and I can get back to DS with a focus on direct giving, which has an
effective impact of 730.

Once I do my MBA and find that I don't have a job in the top
companies, I would be in a much better situation to evaluate what is
the course for me. As a minimum I say that I should be able to do
something that will get me on the road to DS or project management and
have a few years delayed route to EAO anyways. I reduce the value by
25% to account for the delays. Further, after 5 or 6 years of work in
case I decide to take the exit opportunities, such a career path has
the potential to save 700 lives, say with 50% of success. In the end
even after 20 years if I don't become partner then I suspect I can
meet the impact of taking an exit opportunity (700 lives). If I came
so far, I should be able to do that atleast I guess. The effective
value of such a decision tree becomes then: 651 lives.

This sums up the whole MC career I think. I think I should run these
numbers by someone to know if where I stand. I am not sure how good
are my chances to DW. I suspect they are poor even with the skills as
I gathered from my friends with an MBA. But it is for later
evaluation. Atleast I am not able to do it justice. Maybe that turns
the tables over. Not sure. Later!

As partner though you could earn a freaking lot. We will estimate
the impact later. But this is a path then for earning-to-give. And
in case you crash and burn, you still have exit opportunities and in
my case maybe a citizenship in NL to continue DE or DS.

Yeah I am not sure. I have tried to ask my friends what if I can get a
job, but it sounds too far fetched. Why would I slog so much to gain
some part of the capabilities to go into DW. I see DS as a direct
learning to jump as an analyst in NGO's. Becoming an MC in the top
tier firms seems very very hard. If my plan is to go there then that
is what I should do.

- Trying out MC in top firms by directly applying

	A quick search on LinkedIn shows that many people have move to
	consulting from engineering (without an MBA). These people are
	sometimes from the exact university I studied and with probably a
	similar technical knowledge as me. People from [applied

**Reflection**

So MC seems to have an unusually high skill offered, lot of
connections, limited potential to do direct work but crazy potential
for ETG. However considering personal fit and other things like my
wish/ability to do an MBA with a scholarship only, and to try be that
high-achiever that top MBA's need, I feel that I have less chance as
shown above. However trying it and succeeding could impact many more
lives with small loss in end result. And hence we look at the decision
tree and try to see the effective value looking at failure scenarios
as well. The effective value of such a decision tree is 673 lives.

{:.tablestyletwo}
| Crossroad             | Success | Other | #lives if Success | #lives if failure | EI: Success | EI: failure |
|-----------------------|---------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| GMAT                  | 70.0%   | 30.0% | NA                | 730               | 469         | 219         |
| Scholarship           | 60.0%   | 40.0% | NA                | 730               | 378         | 292         |
| McKinsey              | 50.0%   | 50.0% | NA                | 65%x700           | 368         | 263         |
| 5+ yrs & 60+ hrs/week | 51.0%   | 49.0% | NA                | 700               | 392         | 343         |
| Make partner          | 12.5%   | 87.5% | 1,250             | 700               | 156         | 613         |


The explanation of the numbers above is as follows: If I only succeed
all the way, then the impact I could create would be greater than 1250
lives over my lifetime. I think this is huge as compared to other
profiles. I could fail at different points in the decision tree. If I
fail to get a scholarship or if I fail getting a decent score in GMAT,
it would cost me a year in time. I can pick up my stuff and work
towards 'DS for DW', hence an impact of 730 lives. Taking small risks
now, seems like a good idea to better gauge what I am capable of. And
taking risks without much severe consequence can lead to doing
significant good. There is a 50% chance of getting a job at
Mckinsey. In case it doesn't work out then, it's not the end of the
world. I think I can still get to 'DS for NL', or look at other
consultancies or marketing etc... At this time I would be in a much
better position to evaluate what is the best direction for me to go
in. Let's say the impact in this case is 65% of taking one of the exit
opportunities in MC (its an optimistic guess). After working 5 years
if I realize that MC is not for me, I would take the exit
opportunities. The impact would then be 700 as calculated earlier for
'ETG taking exit opportunities in MC'. And in the last case if I push
further and still fail then I would still expect the impact to be 700
or greater. Going further in MC should only further my impact. And the
effective value of such a tree is 673 lives.

To boost my chances or to see if I am a fit for MC much earlier I
could also try to get a job directly. A quick search on LinkedIn shows
that many people have moved to consulting from engineering (without an
MBA and also from my same university). These people are sometimes from the
exact university I studied and with probably similar technical
knowledge as me. People from [applied physics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borisnaar/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top%3BRBPj%2FS4mQJuPekMFdt120Q%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top-search_srp_result&lici=Zcn778IiTcKe573Tp9BzjA%3D%3D) and [offshore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascal-smulders-00a9b665/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top%3BRBPj%2FS4mQJuPekMFdt120Q%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top-search_srp_result&lici=H2eQm%2BpGT22%2FhseUYpUDLQ%3D%3D)
who have done a wide variety of other things seem to have gotten in. A
[very talented systems engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo-hoogslag-49abba83/) and a person from aerospace
background from my university has gotten in. Most of the people I
immediately find online are people who are from un-related departments
only. But it feels like they have done some interesting things in
their life. I can spend a few months and try this as well before
starting anything. This way I could get some experience and see how I
fare in consulting. If all goes well, use this to do an MBA in a top
college and continue killing it.

I feel at many times that I might not be suited for it, as it is for
people who have been achieving all their life. I thought in the past,
that I could never get a 9 in my grades. I got many in the second year
of may masters. I never thought I was cut out for these things. I
thought in the past that my first job would be a disaster because I
knew nothing, I have been getting good evaluations until now. These
might not look like big achievements, but all I want to say that I
don't know my potential yet.

### MBA into IB/ Finance/ Trading/private equity 

Based on the end appendix, I assume IB, Finance, Trading and PE all to
be similarly build regarding all the parameters I am using to compare.

<!--  to to find something about the end appendix -->

**Skills**

Sufficient Exit opportunities in IB/PE. One can go to consulting
even. Skills in finance can apparently be earned within 6
months. After that it is a mudane job. Skills are good enough to
transfer jobs even to MC and likely many more exit opportunities
occur. 8.5/10.

**Connections**

Unlike MC, [Investment banking on the other hand](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/152549/working-for-mckinsey-bain-and-boston-consulting-vs-goldman-jpm-and-morgan-stanley) is work in front
of a PC most of the time and meeting clients does not happen very
often especially within the first few years.
 
 6/10
 
**Credentials**

I think with MC/IB you will make good credentials. You are making
crazy money, you have IB written on your resume. If you can move from
IB to MC, then I conclude it has sufficient credentials. 8/10.

**Runway**

After getting into IB runway might be crazy, but until then, the same
runway as in DE or DS exists holds. 7/10.


**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

- Need to kiss ass
- Need to [face time](https://thetab.com/2015/12/21/face-time-how-investment-banking-interns-are-trying-to-impress-their-bosses-66037)
- long freaking hours 80-100hrs/week
- No life what so ever but a lot of money
- mundane work
- Loss in health?

Need I go on?

**Personal fit**

>If the mean income of a hedge fund trader is $650,000, then that’s
>$20m over a 30 year career. If you donated half, that would be enough
>to cover the salaries of about 5 non-profit CEOs or 2-3 academic
>researchers, while still having a huge amount left to live on. 

- Earning to give

  - Chances of clearing getting >730 in GMAT (70%)
  - Chances of clearing the scholarship criteria for RSM after
    getting 740 (60%) (same as in MC)
  - Chances of not burning out and quitting (10%)
  - getting a job in the top tier firm (50%)
  - Chances of staying for more than 5 years (10%)
  
  If in MC most people don't make partner and only 12.5% do, in IB I
  consider it to be even less.
  
  <!-- Maybe speaking to a few people might help .. Saw youtube video,
  fears are well founded. But need to check private equity and hedge
  funds and what those exit opportunities mean. Based on the footnotes
  I fuond online, they are expected to be equally fucked up.-->
  
  So a grand total of :0.2%
  
- Earning to give once we leave industry after 5 years

I don't see myself going on with IB, so for now I will assume the same
personal fit as in MC. 11%.

**Impact**

- Earning to give 

According to [80k-hours-trading](https://80000hours.org/2017/05/how-much-do-hedge-fund-traders-earn/), junior traders earn 300k - 3m per
year, this they reach within 8 years. More senior you get, the more
crazier it gets that Sr managers earn >10m$ "easily". Assuming average
earnings of 800k over 30 years, it appears that one can save **3771**
lives.

- Exit after 5 years to something else

In 5 years we can save about 100-150 people and then cash in on the
exit opportunities. Based on MC I guess the impact to be 700 lives. In
total 800ish.

- Using skills earned to move to EAOs

Not sure what skill applies here. I don't have the confidence in
selecting this career profile and hence am not spending much time in
evaluating this. I assume it might be the same as the impact for an
EAO,i.e,  970 lives.

**Personal Fit x Investment banking**

I am very afraid or completely not inclined to starting this career. I
maybe can work for 2-3 years. But If I am not working for more than
that then it seems like there is no point doing IB. IB is all about
money and putting in crazy hours all through your life at the cost of
sleep, health etc... I understand it has the maximum potential. I do
feel guilty that so many lives are at stake. But as 80k hours says,
personal fit is quite important. I strongly suspect I will burn out. I
am repelled by all the points mentioned in the supporting conditions
part of this profile. Instead if I did something else I could atleast
get a decent impact out there over a long term.

So I am almost confident that I am not going into the likes of IB, so
I don't see any point in evaluating this any further.


### Programming, Machine learning PhD 

Apparently, learning to program could also be a gateway to DS,
Quantitative Finance, tech entrepreneurship, research and freelance
development. Useful in a multitude of industries, highly
transferable. But I am far from being a programmer. I still think DS
is the first place to start, as it allows me to immediately move to
the other industry and start gaining experience.
	
Also I am not sure how I will compete with all those programmers who
have been programming since they were kids. So I need time and a lot
of it. The same goes for Machine Learning PhD. So instead of staying
in DE I will go to DS, which already has some programming. I will pick
it up from there more about programming.

<!--  I think I need to understand what it means to programm. i.e, -->
<!--  what job I can do and what is the min. requirement to do that. -->

These could result in being the most fulfilling careers, but that is
not the only motive here. 

So for now I will start with 

But maybe then you decide to go into programming instead of DS..

<!-- need to check this out instead -->

### Economics PhD

In this profile we are going to see about three types of paths:

- Taking academic jobs
- Taking non-academic jobs with a rare chance at making large
  impact
  
**Why Econ PhD**

>You gain a broad set of tools for understanding how the social world
>works, which is helpful for evaluating causes and interventions. This
>may help you better evaluate your future career options to have more
>impact. A notable example of this in action is the founding of
>GiveDirectly (one of GiveWell’s top recommended charities), which was
>founded by economics PhD students.

In addition we get adovocacy position

The ability to get a job is very high. Academic work seems to be very
important cause of its impact. 

>Economics professors get a lot freedom to do research across a wide
>range of topics and disciplines, which gives you great option value
>for future research.

**Skills**

- Excellent job prospects

Lowest unemployment rate amongst any science and engineering PhD's

- Can go into wide variety of jobs after PhD (highly transferable)
 
  Academia as well as jobs in policy, think tanks, NGO research, World
  banks, IB, Consulting
  
- Good safety net even if not in Academia

- This gets a 9/10.

**Connections**

Probably not much, but you get credentials which are very good which
can allow you to get connections. No during a PhD I suppose. This gets
a 6/10.

**Credentials**

>She explained that one of our main jobs as agency economists was to
>think about the big picture and be the voice of 'common sense' in the
>room. It is surprisingly difficult to find people who can do this,
>and the 'PhD Economist' credential is a signal that you might be the
>kind of person who can escape groupthink and see neglected but
>important side effects and chains of causality.- [noahpinion](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html)

A PhD in Economics by itself is a solid credential as people respect
what you should be capable of to do such a PhD. A PhD in economics,
gives you credentials for advocacy, in your job and blog life,[ as far
as I have seen.](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html) It can thus be argued that you have a very
important role in decision making as people value your insight into
matters. This puts the credentials as 8/10.

**Runway**

It is what comes with a DE. But it is worth to consider the money I
might have during an Econ PhD. The salary is around 15k$/year during
an Econ PhD. But with jobs I think I can easily make >100k $. So we
are at 5/10.

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

Very solid safety net, except for during the PhD where there is less
feedback and more anxiety. Either you become a tenure track academic,
or a non-tenure track academic or go to a job in policy or consulting
etc... The life of an Economics PhD can be intellectually satisfying.

The rating thus is 7/10.

**Personal fit** 

Assuming we want to be able to get into academic positions, we see
that the Top 10 universities are more respected with better placement
at tenure track and has [less variance in results](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NkhkJxVzqbTG1PZFNyMEN0bEU/view). Mentally
extrapolating to top 20 from [ what might be necessary to get into top
5](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/), it appears that top 20 might still be hard being from
"non-quants background". Even for non-academic jobs, it is easy to get
a job with a non-top 20 college, but the goal for us is to be the best
we can, and not just take have good odds of getting a non-academic
job. It appears to be important to atleast make it to the top 20
colleges, the probabilities for which are as shown:

- Chances of getting 165+ in GRE quants (90%)

	I love math. I already have experience with Linear Algebra, Calculus,
	ODE etc... It has all been part of my Gate training and I didn't shy
	from learning from very top Authors.

- Chances of learning Economics enough to get into top 20 within 2
  years? (70%)

	>An economics major isn’t required but you need proven math ability
	>and it helps to have taken mathematical economics classes.

	I don't know anything about economics and need to see how I fare by
	taking some courses. I can take some courses and see how I fare. I
	think I can do better in math with practice and I am sure it would be
	fun. Chances that I fare well (i.e., scoring>80/100) once I take a few
	econ courses I guess is 70%

- Chances of a getting an Econ Phd within top 20 (other factors) (70%)

	These factors would be things like, recommendation letters and
	statement of purpose working to my favor.

- prepared to work for long hours (95%)

	I have done it in the past. Currently, I clock about 11 hrs on 4
	weekdays per week, and still manage to go to the gym. 80k-hours says
	that I should be prepared to do 70+ hours a week (10 hrs a
	day), atleast during the first year of studies according to
	[econ-job-rumors-website](https://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/how-many-hours-do-you-work-at-various-phases-of-your-phd-studies/page/2). This is not a lot. And I don't see much
	panic around for the work after the PhD. So this is good.

- Research roles interest (80%)

	>Love intellectual pursuits and have a strong drive to do self-
	>directed research? 

	Can't say really. But I guess I would like intellectual
	pursuits. Self-directed research should not be a problem I think. I am
	here to create change. I would like the tools to do the research
	required. And the passion for doing anything seems to be contained in
	the equation of motivation. With good skills to understand how the
	social world works, I suspect I should be able to squeeze the
	necessary amount from the equation. Finishing the PhD badly or
	dropping out are still options to a future in MC or EAOs etc.. So not
	much to worry about.

So the chance of completing decently an Econ Phd within top 20 is:
33.5%

1. Jobs in Academia

	Jobs in Academia allow us to do research in high priority areas


	>the top 10 universities place nearly five times as many students

	>through 20.- [Assessing placement economics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NkhkJxVzqbTG1PZFNyMEN0bEU/view)
	
	Tenure tracks are those in which a professor is given a permanent
    contract. He can then carry out the research that he wants. Tenure
    tracks are quite hard to get within the top 20 universities. But,

	>Both Miles and Noah have marveled at the number of smart people

	>example. - [Qz complete guide to Econ PhD](https://qz.com/116081/the-complete-guide-to-getting-into-an-economics-phd-program/)
	
	It seems fine to work in non-top schools. 

	>People who feel that economics research incentives do not align
	>with trying to do research that is optimized for positive impact
	>may want to spend 7 to 11 years doing what it takes to get
	>tenure, and then work on whatever it is they want to work on. -
	>[Robin Hanson](https://80000hours.org/2013/10/the-value-of-economics-phds-a-conversation-with-robin-hanson/)
	
	A tenure track would give a lot of freedom. Ultimately we would
    want a tenure track and there is a high chance that we might have
    to work a few years before getting it.

	>Data indicates that more than half of the economics PhD’s get
	>jobs in academia after their PhD - [80k career guide](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/economics-phd/#advocacy-potential)
	
	Based on the above, it appears that there is a 10% chance to get
    tenure directly after the PhD. Once I am done with my PhD from the
    top 20, getting a job in academia is about 60-70%. Getting a
    tenure track after a few years of conventional work is estimated
    at 80%.	The total chances of getting a tenure track is thus:
		
		10% + 60%x80% = 58%
	
	So the total chance of pursuing a tenure track from now is 
	
		33% x 58% = 19%
	
2. Non-academia jobs with rare chance of saving >400 lives

	Success here is defined as getting into a government agency and
	getting the [rare chance](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) of making crazy impact (to be read as
	400 lives over a lifetime by a particular act) in addition to
	donations possible as a result of the job. Getting a government
	agency should be easier than pursuing a tenure track, which puts
	us at say roughly 60%. But being able to save an extra 400 lives
	[comes rarely.](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) I weigh this at 20%. Seems high based on what I
	have read, but still. So the total chance of pursuing an agency
	job with the rare chance is:
	
		33% x 60% x 20% = 4%

**Impact**
1. Impact of being in academia
	
    Looking at the career reviews by [80k-hours-guide](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/), we see that
    the impact by direct potential is rated as 3/5 where as for
    working at an EAO it is rated as 5/5. It has been estimated that
    the impact of working in an EAO is 970 lives. Extrapolating based
    on the rating this would put the impact of being in academia as
    ~582 lives.

2. Impact including the [rare chance](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) would be

	- impact of the rare chance 400 lives
	- impact due to advocacy 50 lives (pure guess) 
	- impact due to a jobs paying greater than median acdemic salary of
		108k Compounded at 4% with inflation of 2%, 20% donations and
		10% hike every 5 years (243 people)
	- Earning for a period of 30 years	
	- In total 750 lives


**Personal fit x Impact**

I think 80k hours vision is for people to take Econ PhD and either go
into academia with a tenure track or go into agencies or EAOs. 

- Econ PhD to tenure track

The decision tree is as follows:

Effective Value: 565 lives. 


With this career path we are interested in going to the tenure
track. But the Effective value is much more than the maximum impact
with the tenure track. This is because the '#lives if other is
significantly higher than what a tenure track can provide. If this is
the case, then there is no point of pursuing this career.

Effective value is 541. 

The rare chance can happen anytime after getting the agency job. So
anytime within the next 40 years. In case we do not get the rare
chance, then we have only the ETG to show, which would come to about
350 for 33 years of working in economics waiting for that rare chance.

Although the rare chance path can lead to an impact of 750, it most of
the cases we would get an impact of 350. Once we complete the PhD and
get an agency job, we are left with an impact of:

	12% x 750 + 88% x 350 = 398
	
If this is the combined impact, then I am not sure I am expected to
take this path, as there seems to already be better paths than an Econ PhD.


### Working at an effective Altruism organization 

DS or research as an Analyst/content writer, is what I see myself
starting with Effective Altruism Organizations. With time I hope to
take up more senior roles or start other important organizations with
a better understanding of what is needed.

**Skills**

>We’ve asked leaders of effective non-profits whether it makes sense
>to start your career in the non-profit sector. They said you can
>usually advance faster in the corporate sector because you get better
>training, and that’s where they hire from. -
>[80k-hours-career-guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/#mistake-2-not-building-flexible-career-capital-that-will-be-useful-in-the-future)

It is widely accepted in the community that it is far easier to go
from corporate job to EAO rather than the other way around.
There is very litle on the job training, and lack of senior
mentorship, and the expertise is tied to the EA movement (unlike MC
for example). 

In case we lose job because of changing strategies within
organizations, EAOs running out of funding or stagnation of the EA
movement, then finding a job might be hard say after 10 years of EA
experience. FCC is not only for being able to move from one industry
to the other based on the current need of the world, but it is also
for being able to adapt to changing scenarios. But 80k-hours-guide
seems to suggest otherwise.

>People sometimes worry that working at effective altruist
>organisations doesn’t lead to concrete foreseeable future career
>options. As we’ve argued above, you are likely to build skills and
>connections which mean you’ll have good opportunities in the
>future. However you might still feel uneasy not knowing what the
>future holds, even if on reflection you believe that you’ll have good
>future career options.

<!-- Poor performance cannot be hidden here as most EAO's have a few
tens of --> <!-- people working for them. Hopefully this can be seen
within a year and --> <!-- if necessary we can go back to what we were
doing all our life. -->

For me it is scary when I think about taking it up right away, to
abandon all the FCC I can get and immediately join an EAO. I give it a
6.5/10, although there are the advantages of having a lot of autonomy
in work, and the possibility to test fit for a wide range of roles.

**Connections**

There is little doubt regarding the connections I could make when I
want to be in the EA community [as exclaimed in this article by 80k
](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#how-good-is-the-career-capital) and [by the person who worked in GiveWell](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/). But my connections
seem to only belong here and around here. They will help me find work
within the EA community. 

>If you think the EA community will keep growing, then the value of
>these connections just gets stronger over time.

80k-hours-guide already seems to mention this in a number of places,
that there is a problem if the EA movement stagnates for some
reason. I can't see why it would happen, but 80k-hours-guide mentions
it a couple of times and this should be taken into account.

But as I am looking for connections to improve my chances of success
in EA, I give it a solid 7/10.

**Credentials**

They are less prestigious than Google, Mckinsey or World bank, but
nevertheless some of the organizations have terrific credentials like
having gone through Y-combinator etc...

> Can get impressive achievements due to high levels of responsibility
> Some impressive affiliations (Y Combinator, Oxford, Good Ventures)
> Less brand recognition

The community is very much evidence based and as a result I wouldn't
expect vague feedback or very subjective performance evaluations. This
I suspect already to lead to boastable achievements. Being in a small
organization, allows for high levels of responsibility allowing for
more credentials to be earned. Sounds like an 7/10.

**Runway**

I think I can transition to this job say by doing an internship at one
of the foundations. So this is could be sooner than I think. The
current runway for DE will hold still as it will take me a couple of
years to move to and EAO. 

Once in an EAO, runway is even lower. Ability to save money for
retirement is slow and low.

>As with other startups, there is a risk of your organisation running
>out of funding (though this hasn’t happened to any of the major
>organisations), or substantially changing its strategy, meaning you
>could lose your job.

Without 18k maybe we should not go into this. 5/10

**Personal Fit**

I think I am not yet a personal fit for EAO, but I can quickly get up
to speed with what they want and start working for them asap.

- Ability to gain Experience (80%)

> A track record of engaging with research in the community and making
> productive contributions to it.
  
  I currently don't have any experience other than "blogging", and
  being a 10-percenter for over 1.5 years. But I can try doing other
  things, like starting an EA org in my city or working for 80k-hours
  or someone from home, producing some work for them and showing how
  much I am worth. I could also apply for an internship of 2 months,
  provided I get that time off. I mean what else is there to do in
  life.
  
- Relevant disciplines can be easily studied and skills built (85%)

	I can work on what topics such as statistics, philosophy and
    blogging from home to build myself to be work-ready for an EAO.

- Care about EA (90%)

	> They really care about effective altruism, and are happy to talk
	> about it all day.

	What else is there to do in life?

- Can you manage your time and be efficient and self-directed? (85%)

	With more responsibility I will thrive. I thrive in new situations
	and learn quickly and literally anything. I have demonstrated this
	ability at my current company and my internship (according to the
	feedback I have received. I am always looking for hard problems to
	solve.

	>They’re self-directed, able to manage their time well, they can
	>create efficient and productive plans, and keep track of complex
	>projects.

	I am not sure how good I am, but I think I can manage a decent job
	and will get better based on how important the job is to me I
	guess. I am also very hardworking.

- Managing in case you loose your current job or the startup crashes
  (80%)

	It is possible the EA movement as a whole loses it's momentum? If
	I loose my job, atleast I am part of the community and would have
	built some contacts.

	If I loose my job right in the beginning, and can't find anything
	tangible, then I can always go back to where I used to belong. If
	I loose my job for whatever reason say after 5-10 years then it
	appears I should have enough contacts in EA to pull me through
	this. In any case it is better to invest in some FCC before I join
	EAOs to handle all situations.

	But it is scary, say you have to move to the US, and then you find
	that you loose your job, yes it is scary. But that is with any
	startup and sometime you got to take your chances, with a good
	plan C.

In total I would have 41.6% of personal fit right now.

**Impact**

- Looking at number of lives due to this direct work

I assume working at an Effective EAO will allow me to save 970 lives
as detailed in the appendix. or more.

Also...

- Talent constrained vs funding constrained

Many organizations are talents

**Exit options**

>- Well positioned for senior positions in EA organizations

>- Connections in EA community allow exits into wide range of sectors

Perfect.

Main point with any career is build your connections and create value.

What about don't do direct work yet?

**Satisfying conditions**

I really hope. It's going to be EA 24*7? Let's see.

8.0 is the guess.       



### Founding a startup

There seems to be a lot of pointing towards learning to program and
learning the business. I guess that any skill you learn is useful and
anything you are very good at will put you in a better place to
startup.

**Skills**

>Starting a tech company will force you to rapidly learn highly useful
>entrepreneurial and technical skills, meet lots of people, and it
>looks impressive (even if your business eventually fails, at least in
>failure-tolerant cultures such as the US and UK). Overall, we think
>it’s one of the best options for career capital.

8/10.


**Connections**

You will probably meet a ton of people in the community, possibly some
influential people,depending on how good you are. If they will help me
to find opportunities and spread ideas later, I guess there is a
decent chance. But beware of [some horror stories and the connections
as a result](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-startup-accelerator-and-incubator-horror-stories). I will just assign it to be less than MC. This is
primarily due to uncertainty 7/10.

**Credentials**

Having gone quite far with a startup might already serve as reasonable
credentials. So 8/10. But the chances of doing this are really low and
that is captured by the personal fit and need not be accounted for
here.

**Runway**

This career needs 18 months runway atleast. A lot of work needs to be
done in your own time before you say become part of an incubator. My
current job in DE will get me there in 2-3 years. Thus 6/10.


**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

I suspect there might be stress due to lack of funding, long hours are
there here, but I barely see myself complaining. There is a high
degree of autonomy and I have a personal stake in the situation. I
should definitely try it out with some decent skill or always be on
the lookout for some opportunities. I am not worried about it. I am
sure it would be a great journey. 7/10.

I am not worried about it though!

**Personal**

>Consider this career if you think you can develop strong technical
>skills, as well as the ability to deal with high risk of failure,
>work very long hours and do something unconventional.

 In order to estimate personal fit I will look at the chances. I
assume success to be able to get into Y-combinator and come out as a
successful business as:

- Chance of having the vision to be a Y-combinator level startup and
applying (5%)	

This seems like a lot especially considering my current level of
skills. But I do pick up things relatively fast, and can work long
hours. For now, lets just role with that number.

- chance of getting accepted in Y-combinator (2.5%)
- Chance of that startup succeeding (25% based on current
  [Ycombinator list](https://yclist.com/) of 11 years)
- total of 0.03% (by multiplying everything)

**Impact**

>The high risk of entrepreneurship also means that it’s likely not
>enough people pursue it in order to gain personal status or wealth,
>so society is likely to be undersupplied with entrepreneurs. One
>study estimates that for every $1 of profit earned by an innovator,
>$50 of benefits are generated for society at large.

>One concern is that some companies within technology have been
>accused of exploiting addictive tendencies to gain users, so the fact
>that a product gains lots of users may be a poor indication of its
>value in these cases.

> Highly unsure of average impact. - 80k-hours-career-review

As it is quite hard to estimate or compute other impacts, we are just
going to look at ETG.

I estimate the impact of starting up in tech to be
	
- Total donations per annum (50% of [2.5m$](https://80000hours.org/2014/05/how-much-do-y-combinator-founders-earn/#fn:5))
- cost of one life (4k$)
- Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
- Number of years of donation = 25
- Increase in salary = 0% max per annum
- Job change every 5 years with 0% increase
- Total: ~6k lives

**Personal fit x Impact**

- Starting up as a means of ETG

| Crossroad             | Success | Failure | #lives if success | #lives if failure | EA: if success | EA: if other |
|-----------------------|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| y-combinator level    | 5.0%    | 95.0%   | NA                | 80%x35/40x700=613   | 23             | 466          |
| Getting accepted by Y | 2.5%    | 97.5%   | NA                | 80%x30/40x700=525   | 44             | 410          |
| Succeeding within Y   | 25.0%   | 75.0%   | 6,000             | 80%x25/8x700=438   | 1500           | 263          |

In this decision tree, we take into account the factors discussed in
personal fit and the impact. The rest of the columns are self
explanatory except the '#lives if failure' column. In case of failure
I assume that I can work similar to an MC job having taken the exit
opportunities. MC with exit opportunities is expected to make an
impact of 700 lives. I guess that with the CC of starting up, I can
manage 80% of this impact. With every step it is expected that 5 years
of our time is gone and so it is discounted off with a factor 'x/40',
where x stands for the number of years left to work. An effective
impact of 488 is obtained. 

It looks like the startup scene is not for me for many reasons. I
don't have any ideas now, I don't have very solid skills to
leverage. Yes, I can learn in the job, but without idea or something
to speak of, I feel I am nothing. It is very risky with personal fit
absolutely not there. The effective impact is very low as well, and
direct multiplying of the personal fit with the final impact is 2
lives. I am not sure what type of CC I can get and use. In any case
for now I will leave it at this and I will evaluate my options in a
few years or every 6 months and see if there is any scope for starting
up.

### software engineering

**Skills**

- gain skills that there is a shortage off

- exit opportunities include: data science, quantitative finance, tech
entrepreneurship, research and freelance work.

>Knowing programming is also helpful in many other industries and is
>likely to become more valuable in the future. 

- Not much scope for other things besides programming such as
   entrepreneurship or work with different organizations like in
   consulting. So skills are transferable and is usually a decent fit
   for earning to give, not so much direct work unless you find
   something to do in your freetime that somehow improves this.

- 7/10.

**Connections**

6.5/10 due to the hype and factoring for uncertainty.

**Credentials**

Working at top-tier companies already gets you lot of prestige
apparently comparable to working in finance or consulting. Assuming
getting into top companies is only a matter of effort, I give it a
close 7.5 as compared to MC.

**runway**

>Software engineering is a moderately well-paid career. Average US

US seems to be the place to be and further more silicon valley. Runway
for now is still with DE. Once I get a job in real programming say in
the US, runway shall never be a problem. 6/10.

It should be easy as even humanities and science people have done it
by their own. Demonstrating strong interest in programming will
help.


Working in NL/Europe:

- Chance of getting into software company (within 1-2 years) (90%)
- Chance of learning the skills of being google worthy in Europe (85%)
- Chance of getting into top tech companies in Europe in 5 years
  (other factors) (80%)
- Total: 61.2%

Working in US:

- All of the above chances: 61.2%

- Chance of getting an L1 (65%)

We use the same chance as used earlier for getting an L1 visa transfer
to the US.

**Impact**

SE for DW: At the end of the day I don't expect to become a computer
scientist in MIRI. I think this is very hard and for the brightest of
minds who have been working on programming for ever, for people who
have been doing computer science for as long as they lived. I am only
now starting and I suspect I am very far from getting close. And that
is why I consider this profession as ETG and that's it. Also it
doesn't seem to be building skills for direct working I
think. Especially that of an analyst, or a management person. I could
be a web developer and develop apps for EAO's, but I don't at this
moment see this taking off in that direction.

Assuming I start with a salary of 120 k at google in the next 5 years.
- with an increase in salary of 4%
- with an increase in salary of 2% after age, 50
- inflation of 2%
- cost of life at 4k$
- every 5 year increase of 10%

Can save about ~360 people. In addition I could work on some advocacy,
and direct work due to the available time. There is possibility to do
more, by working remotely say from Thailand. Working lesser hours on
work and on other side projects. This can ensure saving even more
money.

### Startup employee (to be archived)

I guess I need to split it as an additional contribution.

We expect lower impact, risk and personal demands than a co-founder, 

>If you get the opportunity to join a startup that’s taking off, you
>may have greater earnings and impact by joining it than founding your
>own e.g. the 100th employee of Dropbox still made about $10m,
>equivalent to a 10% stake in a $100m company. -
>[Startup-employee-80000-hrs](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/startup-early-employee/)

The situation we envision and work out odds for is that, we join at
the beginning of a taking off startup and we are say 50-100 employees
into a big ass startup.

I keep the values for this quite rough. To me this appears as an
option in addition to something I choose. When I am at the position of
applying for jobs, that is when I should evaluate how important it
is.

**Skills**

Depends on startup and the things you do, for example, DE, or DS or
management etc... Lets give it an 8, assuming that if you are one of
the first 50-100 employees you are probably given a lot of
responsibility and somehow the skills and knowledge become
transferable.

8/10.

**Connections**

Depending on the job and whom we have to interact with we might have
much larger set of connections.

Whether these connections will get you somewhere? depends and for the
uncertainty, it gets 6.

**Credentials**

It is very uncertain and depends on the field of choice. I say this
because the Credentials I have evaluated are different based on the
fields chosen.

Usually though if it is a high impact startup then you probably have
better credentials. I think this is tough to evaluate. I give it a
value of 7, sort of like an average of the fields I have seen until now.

**Runway**

Will be lower than a normal job in the beginning. 6.0 in the beginning
I guess.


**Personal fit**

As said earlier I will evaluate this further in the coming days when I
am in the lookout say for a job.

I am already working in a startup. When talking about how successful I
will be? 

Unfortunately the odds are that of how successful any startup would be
or how a startup would grow to be the next Airbnb etc... We will use
the same numbers as in `Founding a startup section`.

0.03%. The personal fit is ofcourse only for the extra contribution.

**Impact**

Impact in a startup is estimated at 8k lives. 

>Instead of receiving about 20% of the company’s equity, as a founder
>would, you’ll receive 0.1% – 1% depending on your role and how early
>you join, and you’ll receive more of your compensation as salary
>rather than equity. - [80k-hours startup employee](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/startup-early-employee/)

So the resulting impact is expected to be, lets say 0.5% of 8k = 40
in addition to the impact a normal engineer would have over his
lifetime, which is about 200-300 lives.

Of course there are other ways of increasing the number of lives
saved, but these could just well be our conservative estimates.

**Supporting conditions**

It cannot be as intense as it is for the co-founder. This is pretty
much the impression I get. Trainings and learnings from experienced
people might not really be present here. 

It would be a lot of responsibility. Might have good autonomy and
decent working hours. It will certainly fit with the rest of my life
relationships etc..

8/10.

### Other interesting options

**Startup employee**

As said by 80k-hours-guide, being an employee of a seemingly
taking off startup could give us large earnings.

>If you get the opportunity to join a startup that’s taking off, you
>may have greater earnings and impact by joining it than founding your
>own e.g. the 100th employee of Dropbox still made about $10m,
>equivalent to a 10% stake in a $100m company. -
>[Startup-employee-80000-hrs](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/startup-early-employee/)

Joining a startup will be based on the field I choose to take on
further. With most paths like MC, DS, I don't want to begin at a
startup as I don't have much to offer, i.e., experience. 

In startups we typically don't get senior mentorship, training and the
like. If it is really small say 10-15 people then you are expected to
perform by yourself with very little help from others as they might
not know much. When things get technical, I would rely on experience,
regarding softskills I think I can pick it up on the job. 

We get a lot of autonomy and responsibility in startups. Its nice for
soft skills but not really for hard skills especially when you are
developing it from scratch, I think. I will evaluate possibilities of
going into startup with each career.

**Finance + DS**

I do not know how to evaluate this. It appears that it gives more FCC
than simply DS. But to go into it directly might be hard. I would
atleast need to do some courses in Finance. In case I choose DS, I
would first like to get a job and start with it and from there explore
other options. In any case, I will evaluate these type of options when
I choose the path and start looking for jobs.

**Finance + SE**

Same as DS. I will look into this when the time is right.

**Dubai**

Seems like a lucrative option especially for ETG. I have a few cousins
who are in their early 40s. These people were ordinary people in my
home town, with a bachelors and having a normal job. All three of them
went to Dubai one by one and got jobs. All three of them own BMWs
now. They have houses worth 200k $ in India (This is quite a lot for a
house in India). They lead luxurious lives, none of their wives work
and they have exotic holidays. My dad was exclaiming recently that one
of them went to US for 1 week with his family for 18k$. That is sheer
luxury spending or in other words someone who can clearly ETG and
more.

Long time back they reached this state of luxury. Dubai seems to be a
money milking country. I should definitely give it a try at some point
if things don't work out. I would most certainly like to estimate how
much my earning potential would be. 

One of the cousins was a mechanical engineer. The other two are in
insurance etc...

The one thing that is not nice with Dubai, is that we could loose our
job in an instant, there is not much security about that. All contacts
developed as a result might go waste. 

<!-- talk to kailash and what he is doin in dubai, how much he earns -->

<!-- talk to guy who said money printing -->

One way I see myself go there, is to finish an MBA, work for a few
years and then try Dubai. But first I want my citizenship in
Netherlands.

<!--  need to estimate potential earnings -->

possible routes, mech --> sales --> dubai or mech to mba to dubai



**Party politics, Policy**

All this as far as I have seen require a US citizenship or UK
citizenship. Not sure how to see myself there. This seems quite far
fetched. Of course doing something related to policy could be possible
through an MBA or an Econ Phd. By the looks of it Econ PhD is quite
far fetched. 

**Think Tanks**

> potentially your entire career, without successfully influencing
> government policy. - [80k-career-guide](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/think-tank-research/#get-free-one-on-one-career-advice)

So demotivating to hear this regarding think tanks. Am not sure as a
result, if this would be the right career. I will first gain some FCC
and then see how I can go about it. So for now this is not for me. As
a pointer I want to say that what they require is very similar to an
anayst or researcher in one of the EAOs. *Should be much easier to
apply for coaching in this case.*

**Discussion with friend in mechanical from same university**

**Entry opportunities**

 Dubai market is mainly based on projects. Dubai is trying to be a
 trading hub. They want to have a large influx of people into and out
 of Dubai continuously! There is no R&D, there is no
 manufacturing. Things like sales, marketing, management, banking,
 finance, seem to be relevant here. Sectors like Automotive,
 construction, marine, aviation, banking, insurance, can be targeted
 here.
 
 Some examples of entry opportunities I have heard of:
 
 - 'site-engineer' for construction, infrastructure, marine projects.
	 
 Start with the lowest salary of 48k AED and slowly jump to
 different and more meaningful roles over time with good salary
 jumps. Within 6 years my classmate jumped to a salary of 300k AED. An
 average jump of 35% each year.

- Heat load mechanical engineer or similar to sales

 My cousin who went to Dubai as a mechanical engineer, moved into the
 sales space and is now general manager of a group. This guy probably
 earns ~650k AED over 13 years of being in dubai, having started at a
 salary of 48k AED. This implies an average jump of 22% over 13 years.
 
- Insurance
 
 Another cousin of mine made it into insurance after a mere Master in
 commerce and a lot of hardwork. He is in Dubai for ~18 years. He also
 started out with 48k AED and moved on to 750k in the span of 18
 years. This is about 16% increase on average for 18 years.
  
- Banking
 
 Another cousin who had been in Dubai for 10 years was earning
 450k. He managed himself into this field with an electronics
 background. Roughly 25% jump every year for 10 years.
 
- MBA --> consulting or management type of roles
 
 It seems to look like a better idea to gain some experience and
 then come to Dubai to find suitable roles. In the worst case you
 can go back to the country where you came from in case Dubai
 decides to fuck you up. 
 
 Based on discussions with people in Dubai, I have come to an estimate
 of 400-450k AED if I move to Dubai after an MBA, assuming I killed it
 in my MBA and the job I take up after that.

- Design Engineering

	Highly unlikely to be in any sort of technical level work. Haven't
    seen any evidence that suggests that engineers at all are
    important and that they can earn as reasonably as people in
    management.
	
For me it appears that I should pursue the MBA track, gain some
experience and then come here. I don't want to put my precious years
gambling and surviving in Dubai, rather I want to be earning FCC.
	
**Exit opportunities**

I have not much idea about this. I have seen cases of people who are
fired and don't have jobs as a result. With an MBA and doing a lot of
hardwork, I suppose in the worst case I could make atleast half the
impact of a successful career in Dubai. It looks like I will be
obtaining my citizenship in holland in a few years, so my fall back
option would be to come back here and see how I can fare. 

**Impact**

I think the best way right now is with an MBA and some consulting
experience. This means by the age of 35 I could be in Dubai in some
management position. A retirement age of 60-65 is considered here
unlike in other countries as I do not expect the current retirement
age to grow in Dubai, as their economy does not need people to work
long. This leaves us with the number of lives saved between 530 and
730 lives.


- working for another 25 years from 35
- starting at 400k AED (108k$)
- with growth of 10% per year until I am 55
- followed by a growth of 2% per year until I am 60
- using max. age for working as 60
- 25% donation (having already budgeted 15% for retirement)
- and 2% inflation on the price of a life


**Personal fit**

All the chances of doing an MBA, apply here and in addition we have
the chance of losing job in dubai which I estimate at 20%, i.e., 80%
of keeping the job in Dubai.

- Clearing GMAT (70%)
- getting scholarship (60%)
- join Mckensey (50%)
- getting job in Dubai with 3+ years of consulting exp (75%)
- Not loosing said job until 60 (75%)

**Personal fit x Impact**

We make a decision tree and compute the effective value of pursuing
such a career in Dubai.

| Crossroad                | Success | Other | # lives:Succes | # lives: failure | EI: Success | EI: failure |
|                          |         |       |                |                  |             |             |
|--------------------------|---------|-------|----------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| GMAT                     | 70.0%   | 30.0% | NA             | 730              | 437         | 219         |
| Scholarship              | 60.0%   | 40.0% | NA             | 730              | 332         | 292         |
| McKinsey                 | 50.0%   | 50.0% | NA             | 65%x700          | 326         | 228         |
| getting job in dubai     | 75.0%   | 25.0% | NA             | 700              | 476         | 175         |
| not loosing job in dubai | 75.0%   | 25.0% | 730            | 350              | 548         | 88          |


This produces an effective value of 655.

## Analysis

I have created an excel sheet pooling in all the data computed
above. Two main parameters (CC and impact) and more than a dozen
career options to choose from. Such data is also available within the
80k-hours-career-guide, but that does not allow as much comparison as
needed. For example, I don't care if I ETG or do DW. I care about IT,
i.e., number of lives saved. So I want to be able to get data on total
impact and not individual impact of direct work or ETG or advocacy, as
is available on 80k-hours-guide. In addition to the above, I have made
subdivisions in many career options for which 80k hours does not have
the data I need. For example, MC is split into `MC for ETG` and `MC
for DW`. This allows me to see which career direction has what type of
impact.



<!--  Lets do the CC and IT comparison later, first lets eliminate te -->
<!--  obvious based on these 2 parameters. -->



Next we need to be in a position to compare CC and IT. How much CC is
equivalent to how much IT. For this we assume CC of MC (5 star rating
for CC in the 80k-hours-guide) is equal to IT of working in an EAO
(which also has a 5 star rating for impact). This output as a result
shall just be a guideline for us to remove the most obvious.

We group CC and IT by suggesting that CC of MC and IT of
EAO is the same. 

<!-- sanity check still not written -->

### Elimination of the obvious

Support conditions wise IB seems like a reject. I am quite afraid of
the extremely long hours, the need to facetime, the lack of attention
to health etc... I might be able to do it for a few years, but not for
long. IB doesn't make sense if it is not going to be done for the next
10-15 years as it is all about ETG. I'd rather try to get into
MC.

CC wise, DE appears to give little or no support to the career
ambitions I have, which is to go into EAO's in management positions or
analyst roles. DS seems like a clear winner when compared to DE.

Although Starting-up has unbelievable potential for impact, and pretty
good career capital, it still sucks as an option because of the very
poor personal fit. In any case starting-up - in case there you forsee
great potential- must be evaluated with other options
then. Starting-up is not for me NOW, that's it.

Getting a top econ PhD is hard and costs a lot of time. The `Econ PhD
with the rare chance` is definitely not an option due to how rarely we
get an option to actually make a difference. The `Econ PhD not
including the rare chance` currently assumes an impact based on `MC`,
as I am not sure how to maximize Impact if not with MC. I am not sure
it is worth the effort of Econ PhD to in the end do MC. In cases of
Econ. PhD or MC I need to prep for a few years to get into good
programs. Econ PhD seems much more far-fetched than making it to an
MBA program even with scholarship given that I have time to prep for
it. CC wise and IT wise MC trumps Econ. Phd as well going with our
intuition. But then I do not really understand why 80k hours suggests
people to do an Econ PhD. But they do rate the direct work potential
with a 3/5.

`Working in an EAO` right now does not seem like a good
option. The 80k-hours-career-guide suggests to work elsewhere where we
can gain senior mentorship and training, before coming into an
EAO. Gain quite some CC to be able to do a wide variety of things.

<!-- All I need is info above to support this one sub-section, i.e., I
--> <!-- just need a briefing of all careers and make separate posts
for --> <!-- each career.-->

### Data Science vs Software Engineering

Not sure of the Direct Work potential with Software
Engineering. Unless I am starting up or something Software Engineering
doesn't really make sense. If I am going to Startup then every thing
right now has equal probability in my eyes, be it Management
Consulting or Data Science or Software Engineering. Software
Engineering seems nice for post retirement plans, but considering my
Effective-Altruism-Organization plans or ETG, I don't see Software
Engineering serving me better than Data Science or Management Consulting.

### Data Science vs Management Consulting

Careers in Data Science and Management Consulting appear to be causing
large impacts and creating the necessary CC to help us create maximum
impact. I am going to compare the CC, impact values and personal
fit. I can look at the Effective value and see what makes sense. I
shall factor in whether it is a recommended or a non-recommended
career. I also want to factor in how retirement is going to look, and
this is something I never thought about.

The numbers seem to be close, and I would like to make a choice
between them, or a trade-off if you will. 

<!-- effective value, CC personal fit and Impact (number of lives -->
<!-- saved) -->

|                                    | `DS for DW` | `MC for ETG` |
|------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| CC                                 | 88/125      | 106/125      |
| Impact                             | >970        | >1050        |
| Personal fit                       | 74%         | 1.3%         |
| Effective Value (# of lives saved) | 770         | 670          |

It is very hard to get Management Consulting at the top institute, it
is hard to get Management Consulting with scholarship and in the end
to get into Mckinsey as dictated by the personal fit. However getting
into Data Science seems to be quite easy, as many people from other
fields have moved into here and it gives you skills in statistics
etc.. which are quite useful while going into an
Effective-Altruism-Organization. Pursuing Management Consulting with a
focus of being partner looks quite far fetched.

There seems to be a chance of much higher impact considering bonuses etc...

Most of the featured profiles in the 80k-hours-career-guide have no
MBAs
	
#### Can Management Consulting help in DW

I am not sure... as ram says if you want to go into acad positions,
you might as well start young. and a quick look at who FHI employs is
primarily research scholars of some kind, who have certain expereince
and seem to be the top of the top. 

So I asked ram, a middle office analyst in IB and Vinod a deloitte
consultant currently pursuing his MBA in Cornell, a few questions on
how an MBA followed by the top consulting job will help me contribute
the best impact. Both of them gave me their inputs.

An MBA by itself CC wise seems amazing due to the number of things you
can branch into. A consulting role in the top firms after, is valued
even more. You can go into entrepreneurship, or to other corporate
companies in chief-of-staff roles or strategy teams, based on the
industry you served and gained experience in.



>Yes an MBA will help because a huge component of my MBA is people
>management. How to work in a team, how to manage people, how to lead
>successfully. 

To circle back to the beginning though, most of the examples in the
80k-hours-career-guide are people without an MBA or consulting
experience and in leading roles at the worlds top organizations. At
this point I feel this is in sync with what Ram said when I asked
about exiting from being in Management Consulting into a non-profit
for a [job of project management in FHI](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/project-managers/),

>I'd say MC has nothing to do with where you wish to be at the end of
> it i.e. academic role that you desire. If academic project
> management is what you desire, might as well start off there right
> away.  Is making money and building a safe fund your prerogative in
> MC? Then, it is fine. Otherwise, not necessary for where you want to
> be.

**Conclusion**: I am more inclined to think based on the factors above
that, maybe Management Consulting going into is about touching my nose around
my head as it is just a bit too much work for getting in an
Effective-Altruism-Organization, when an option for doing Data Science
is much less harder and less risky. 

Going into Management Consulting and the like for the money makes
sense, with the exit opportunities and impact of becoming a partner. 

The exposure, CC and etc... you get seems unparalleled. I don't need
to start right away at McKinsey but I could even start at deloitte for
example and work my way up to an MBA in 2 years. and the personal fit
should definitely be considered. What is the chance of succeeding,
especially considering that I want to be in NL for the next few years
and would potentially apply. BCG wants to fluency in Dutch. 

Doing the course might still be a start, to obtain quants skills, to
do data interpretation and work on business logic. Consulting firms
also seem to employ Data Science people. So lets start with Data
Science and take it from there, mean while scout where all to apply
to in a decreasing order of interest, 

All the time focus on communication (presentating your concepts) and
write to 80k for cc advice and show them what you are! Focus on
gaining cc and try to evaluate again within the next 6 months. One
last thing, maybe I should re-evaluate how hard it is to be a partner.


<!-- retirement -->

In most of the cases, I see myself giving up tech in the sense of
coding and doing things within the next 10-20 years as I would be in
management getting more impact done. 

<!-- Savings with an Effective-Altruism-Organization? I find myself -->
<!-- worrying about reitrement and the adambara vaalkay the one that I -->
<!-- cannot afford. 2k euros a year-->


I will have no kids and will probably be alone at that time.


<!-- problems -->

Problems I imagine are that the EA goes down and then I am left with
Data Science to create success. Where as with Management Consulting
and having moved into EA, I should still possibly able to pickup on
the exit opportunities for upto 5 years after quitting.


#### Uncertainities

- Failure of EA movement
- ability to get into top EA places in the next 5 years
- becoming partner is very hard
- becoming partner at non-top 3 is useless?
- Management Consulting for Effective-Altruism-Organization is not
  really ideal, Data Science could be more fitting.

## What is needed?

Up until now, we have seen about the different careers that I can take
up. With this section I want to investigate what problems are there
and how DS or MC can help me in them.

To me this sounds more like what do EAOs need rather than anything
else. Careers like MC, DE for ETG, it is very clear what needs to be
done and the chances of doing them can be estimated, but what we want
to know or what is the unknown is if the DS, MC, can get us into think
tanks, finance jobs as researchers and what ever else there is. This
is the question that needs answering.

I still find the question of what is needed directed at choosing the
problem right now, as far fetched. But what if there is a problem that
needs a special kind of skill? 

So are there problems that "I" could take on if I got some special
skill?

What do the other important problems need?

Can I get them by working in DS or MC?

https://80000hours.org/2017/11/talent-gaps-survey-2017/

  * [ ] What is needed...  to be done
  
### What do the other important problems need?

[Here](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/) we have a ranking of the different problems by
80k-hours-guide. I first looked at the recommended ones:

- Positively shaping AI
- Promoting Effective Altruism
- 

**Positively shaping AI**

Google Deepmind, OpenAI are some projects that I could get into with
knowledge of writing software. I would imagine a 5 year period to get
up to speed if this is the direction I should be going into. I suspect
DS would be a decent start or maybe even just simply software, if
there is some statistics involved. DS seems to allow me to work on
Machine Learning, so I am inclined to be in this realm of DS.

There are organizational roles available like project manager
etc... Some involving managing and writing grants to ensure funding.

There are lot of organizations, which work on it as given [in the
80k-hours-guide](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/#what-can-you-do-to-help).

Funding is alright with this, but it is primarily talent
constrained. So not really for ETG.


> Does consulting allow me scope to get into these roles?
>
> HR;
> personnel management;
> project management;
> event management;
> media and communications;
> visual and website design;

As per the estimation of lives saved in EAOs, most jobs in EAOS
should give you a lot of impact, in the order of 1000 lives. Joining
DS or SE can allow to work in the technical side. Joining MC can
possibly give me scope to work in other managerial roles. 

**Note to self**: From time to time I should also try to apply for
jobs directly, based on things like this I hear:

>You should apply if you are a software engineer who is fairly
>comfortable with linear algebra, basic statistics, and the basics of
>stochastic gradient descent. Experience in machine learning is a
>bonus. You are not expected to have mastery of deep learning — the
>problems we pursue are always at the edge of the state of the art,
>which means that nobody's an expert.


**Promoting effective Altruism**

<!-- What I can do -->
What I can do is work for EAOs, ETG, founding new organizations as
needed, and make connections to my field of expertise and the EA
community.

<!-- Where I can work -->
Organizations such as CEA, 80k-hours and Founders pledge do exactly
that. These type of organizations route funding to the best regions
and are in control of growing and strengthening the movement.

<!-- Can DS and MC get me there? -->

DS can help me in research or getting analyst positions. I am not
fully sure if MC can get me these type of jobs. <!-- ask ram -->

**Global priorities research**


<!-- What is needed and what I can do -->

> Researchers trained in economics, mathematics, or philosophy to
> develop the methodology for setting global priorities.  Researchers
> trained in social and natural sciences with the ability to collect
> data and analyse specific global problems.


<!-- Where can I work -->

Join the Global Priorities institute in a research position or support
with managerial positions. 

<!-- Can DS and MC get me there -->

For GPI, a firm no. They need Economists of any level.

For FHI, they need project managers who can lead certain
movements. This could be possible with an MC? <!-- Ask ram -->

So MC probably, and DS not!

<!-- Could be also possible with DS to get into it in AI related tasks -->
<!-- within FHI. But this has nothing to do with Global Priorities -->
<!-- research I think, this is just advancing AI research. -->

**Improving institutional decision making**

<!-- What is needed -->

getting a position in behavorial science/research lab, doing
fundamental research, fostering adoption of proven techniques,
directing more funding towards this research.

This seems to be one research area that is funding restricted and 80k
hours suggests the need to become program managers in various places
who can divert funding to these places or this research.


<!-- Where can I work -->

There are some places

<!-- Can DS or MC get me there -->

It looks like DS or MC might not be able to get me there. Somehow
behavioural/ decision science PhD would help.

Seems very much not for me, except for trying to be a program
manager. And I think it is also hard to become a program
manager. 

To be noted is that this is possibly quite neglected in terms of
funding and research and fostering the best practices where it matters.




Let me join DS for now, over the next 6 months I will again evaluate
what I need to do, There are so many options, I need to spend a lot of
time on this. It looks like MC or DS will give me CC and I can fine
tune my path to create large impact.

MC is hard to get, DS is relatively my personal fit. If nothing works
out in the next few years (I will also do an internship for any EAO
from here), and then apply for an MBA and go from there on.

## What would a reader like to see

What can a reader keep track of?

So I start this essay with an Entry question and write about impact in
general how one can get impact and in what ways on a high
level. During doing this I explore how others have done it and what
are their ways. With this I understand what all I can do to create
large impact.

So I look at different high impact careers and some of the careers not
mentioned to see how they work, I briefly mention the parameters I
would like to use to compare. In the end I present a table with all
the comparisons and refer people to my drive location, This is the
part that I not fully sure if I should have it as it is or just make
separate files of. 

What am I afraid of?

If I have a table to scroll on the left what is my problem? people can
move on in a hyperlinked way. If they cant then I am afraid the
article moves 

For now I assume that is possible. LEt me focus on important things
and then create placeholders for things like tables that need to be
there so I can batch them.



## Appendix
## Things I am wrongly focussing on

Aiyoo word count poidumay if I delete it all!!!! 

Lack of clarity or path of flow.

	So many things are hindering my flow and I refuse to do anything
	about it, like start afresh or properly reqiret... 
	
It is ok to throw away everything. ~~wordcount~~ ~~STM should know how
much effort I put in this thing~~ **Clarity** **ability to choose the
best career that makes maximum impact is**, **allowing others to have a
readable document so that they can learn from me** is king

I need to refactor, look at what I have written until now and reqrite
it. This is much more pleasurable than attempting to edit every
sentence. But this will be time consuming. For now I don't see
any other way.

## Analysis
		
I have now two sets of data one that I made including my personal fit,
all based on articles mostly from 80k and around. The other being the
set of data from[ 80k's career reviews'](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) summary of numbers. I
didn't directly use 80k-hours-career-review-numbers, as I wanted some
more information that was not available. For instance MC for ETG and
MC for DW have different impacts, not fully investigated or talked
about by 80k-hours. Another problem is that I do not know how to
compare ETG and direct impact parameters. So it was necessary that I
generated my own values. Of course a small sanity check is done
comparing the 2 sets of data before moving on.

**Sanity check for Career Capital:**

| my rank | My result     | rank 80k |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| 1       | MC            | 1        |
| 2       | Econ PhD      | 2        |
| 3       | IB            | 3        |
| 4       | DS            | 2        |
| 5       | Working @ NGO | 2        |
| 6       | Starting up   | 2        |
| 7       | DE            | -        |

80k-hours evaluates DS better than IB in CC. But if you can go from IB
to MC, PE, hedge funds and other exit opportunities, I don't see why
it is bad in CC. Maybe the limited learning while in IB is reflected
in the CC in 80k-hours-reviews. This is fine. If required I will
later fine tune the results if I find them to be critical. 

**Sanity check impact**

With 80k-hours-reviews the impact is split up into three factors
(Direct impact, ETG and advocacy) and rated separately, this is not of
much use to me as I want to compare things based on total impact. So
it is attempted to make one number out of the three factors.

For 80k-career-reviews ranking, we simply sum up those 3 ratings and
produce the final ranking. In my way of calculation, I compute total
impact to the extent possible by translating everything into
equivalent money and then translate it to lives by (roughly) dividing
it with 4000$ (,the cost of a life according to AMF).

| my rank | Work                            | rank (80k) |
|---------|---------------------------------|------------|
| 1       | Starting up                     | 1          |
| 2       | IB(ETG)                         | 3          |
| 3       | MC(as a partner)                | 3          |
| 4       | Direct working @ EAO (DS etc..) | 1          |
| 5       | Econ PhD. with rare chance      | 6          |
| 6       | MC (exit after 5 year)          | -          |
| 7       | DS/SE in the US                 | 5          |
| 8       | DE in the US                    | -          |
| 9       | DS in Europe                    | -          |
| 10      | DE in Europe                    | -          |

80k-summed-up-ranking suggests that DW has better impact than IB,
which I am not so sure about based on the numbers I have estimated
regarding total impact. In any case, it does not appear that I might
take IB due to the lack of supporting conditions. In addition, the
whole point of the exercise of determining numbers for impact and
career capital is to mainly remove the options that are obviously
bad. The numbers are not accurate, they are conservative to various
degrees, and also there is uncertainty.The personal fit are so disparate that I
hope that they will actually make the real difference, rather than me
doing anything.

With this I conclude the sanity check and say that the data is
accepted for further analysis.

### How to equate CC and IT

So now in my analysis, as per the guidance of 80k-hours-guide, I find
that there is CC and then there is impact.

I am early in my career (27) and would like to place more weight on
flexible CC. I do not want to completely choose based on
FCC. Ultimately we would like one number from all careers to
compare. So we need to translate CC units to that of Impact (number of
lives saved). The following suggestions are considered and weighed
against.

1. Impact of EAO = CC of MC ; Everything from there could just be a
linear extrapolation.

Seems to be a reasonable estimate I think as MC is the best in CC
according to 80k-hours-guide (5 stars) and Direct Impact of EAO has 5
stars as well.

I think what I am doing here is compare achievable CC to Achievable
impact. This sounds reasonable?

2. Rate max best CC as 10 and best IT as 10.

But the problem is that impact is like very non linear. There is
impact of 400 and there is like 10 times its impact.

Say I know something that can save 8k lives and then something that
can save 400 lives. 8 lives can be 10 and 400 lives can be 0.5. But
then in CC, IB could have a max 10 and DE could have a 5 already. If
we add it up directly then the contribution of impact is so low for
DE. What does this mean? I 

I am afraid it is not weighed properly

Define properly. If there is an accepted number of CC which can
correlate with Impact. Maybe even then we have lot of problems. 


### Looking at the ranking

The second best option seems to be DS in NL as ETG. Shocked! I guess
it is because of the ridiculous personal fit that this has happened.
IB is out of the question. I am really afraid of burning out, the way
of work is quite unhealthy and I need to take care of myself for
serving mankind in the long run.

**CC**
MC seems promising CC wise. But say I find out I am not partner
material or I didn't get a scholarship or the hours are sick, then ETG
is not really an option, so I have to move out. When I move out yes I
can do other things, join a company bla bla and rise the ranks. What I
am uncertain about this is being able to work in an EAO. 

MC is my decentest chance of maximizing ETG. And it is not really out
of my scope I think, although my personal fit might say otherwise. The
personal fit factors in a ton of uncertainity and path that I have
chosen i.e., an MBA without scholarship sounds unimaginable. In case
it is not the cut for me, then with the GREATEST CC (5 stars on 80k) I
should be able to pick up my shit and do other things. But, the other
best way to create impact is by working at an EAO. *My uncertainity is
whether I am allowed to work at an EAO*.

<!-- MC in EAO OK/NOK: mail rob now -->

Given 6 months more, my personal fit estimate would have improved
because, that is how long I plan to take to prepare for GMAT and give
a score. By then I can make a better decision to move out to DS byt
year 28- whats in another few months. It seems like I should be able
to pick up DS with a delay of 6 months. I don't see it as a problem.

I assume the impact due to an MBA not in any of the top 3 or without
a scholarship as shit. I don't consider the career.

maybe... <!-- try to evaluate a MC without scholarship and  -->

**Impact based**

I don't think I can already start working in an EAO as I might need
some special skills, or do other things to get attention of people in
the community before I apply for a job, but never the less, based on

>Earlier we saw the example of Kate, who went to work at a
>non-profit. Not only do non-profit jobs often build your skills more
>slowly, they’re also less flexible. It’s widely accepted in the
>non-profit sector that it’s easier to switch from a business job to a
>non-profit job than vice versa. So if you’re unsure between the two,
>a business position offers more flexibility.

**Best choice overall**

DS in the beginning and moving to opportunities in DW seems to be the
best option with decent CC ([4/5](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) according to 80k) and decent
possibilities to DW ([3/5](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) according to 80k). However, because of
the skills, I see decent chances of moving to an EAO in some
years. There by gaining sufficient flexible CC and capabilities and
credentials to move to be worthy of a top EAO. 

By this I mean for the next 5 years, I will work my ass off and
understand and build my skills in programming and statistics and
writing. This will allow me to improve my scene in the 80k community
and join as an analyst, or writer, researcher based on DATA. Critical
thinking is the main think, solving problems is the other part of it. 

At this point I say, why won't I be offered a job in EAO, taking into
account why I am doing what I doing.

#### Elimination of the obvious

I have the numbers that I need and can already make a decision. Just
choose the highest number and I should be good right? Well there is
uncertainity in the numbers and I want to take it slow and start by
first removing the obvious ones based on reasoning and looking at the
numbers.

**CC wise**

DE for DW is a no go, has the lowest cc rating. One can argue that
once you get into and EAO, you will do great things and with the time
that DE in NL offers I can pretty much build whatever skill I want.

The point is the EAO's primarily require organizational capabilities,
research capabilities, writing capabilities, DS, programming, as far
as I know. But DE seems to offer none of this. Staying in DE and
becoming great at it and moving to a start up can be an option, but we
know how low probability that is.

<!-- What do EAO's actually require skills wise -->

So over all, for the above reasons it seems like a weak choice, but an
obvious other option is to do DS instead and it seems to beat the DE
for DW instantly as it gives you several opportunities to become
capable for EAO, wiht programming and statistics info. Everything
thing that you do at work, is counting towards the 10k-hours-rule
unlike in DE where the work at an EAO is almost orthogonal.

**Support conditions wise**

SC wise it appears that IB is a sure reject. I am really afraid of the
long hours and the tales of horror, lack of excitement in job. Which
is why I think it is a poor fit SC wise even for me. SC, I
gather/understand/guess that it is better even with MC. With hours
being reasonable.

**Impact**

I think it is fair to eliminate Econ Phd with rare chance. Based on my
calculation the number of lives saved isn't as much as working in MC
for 5 years and then leaving

**Total wise**

An Econ Phd can contribute moderately towards impact using ETG and
Advocacy. But, the one that has most impact is when an Econ Phd can
just save too many lives by being at the right place and at the right
moment. The thing is people look at Econ people with respect regarding
things they say, and this makes them very valuable in the field of
policy. 

An Econ PhD however with such a chance of getting this opportunity of
potentially adding benefits to a few millions of lives seems mighty
low as factored in the profile on Econ PhD. To add further, the
estimated impact was calculated to be lesser than EAO impact. Based on
my source who is an Econ PhD from the top 5 universities and got a job
in the government, I think it is wise to let this rare chance in
combination with an Econ PhD slide. 

Despite with the scope of causing maximum impact ever, the chances of
succeeding are really really low for now. 

However, in the later stages of my life working for a startup or
co-founding a startup should definitely be considered, considering the
impact. With a year or 2 of effort, we can better estimate the success
of the startup (say you get accepted into Ycombinator). Even to
attempt startups I need some proper CC, having worked a few years,
which I can use to add value.

<!-- I am afraid that I give more probability to something that is far
--> <!-- away, I seem to be more optimistic about scenario that is -->
<!-- more far away-->

As a sanity check, all the ones eliminated until now, seem to be on
the bottom of the list, when organized based on the total awarded to
each independent career path.

#### Comparing EAO vs DS

Comparing working now at an EAO and taking up DS now, I interpret the
advice from 80k as 'take up DS now'.

> If you are still early in your career, then it’s best to place greater
> importance on career capital than on role impact, as you’re likely to
> be able to find plenty of good opportunities to invest in yourself. If
> you’re late in your career, place less importance on career capital
> and more on making an impact now. That said, the amount of weight to
> put on career capital can also depend on which problems you want to
> work on. See more. 

I anyways need skills, which I need to spend time on. By the looks of
it, statistics, organizational etc... Maybe it may workout that after
one year I should move to EAO. But for now, I don't think EAO is the
right place for me yet.

The CC at an EAO is not really great with respect to getting training
or assistance from experienced people. The DS track followed by
working at an EAO at some point in life seems better than the EAO
track right away based on the advice of 80k-hours.

#### Comparing Econ Phd without the rare chance vs DS

An Econ Phd although hyped greatly by 80k-hours due to its advocacy
potential and possible impact and CC, it still seems to be a not so
great fit. Impact wise I claim an Econ Phd without the rare chance can
save 550 lives @ 29% personal fit. Where as a job at an EAO can save
>970 lives @ 41% personal fit.

It appears that EAO is the place to be and not an Econ PhD. As seen
above though, we want to start with something else (say DS) before we
move to an EAO. By extension then 'DS for DW' beats Econ PhD. 

#### DS vs MC (becoming partner)

MC along with becoming a partner is an incredible opportunity for
ETG. However the personal fit of 1.3% is really low for something with
a potential to save >1200 lives over ones life time. It appears that
it would be better to bet on EAO instead. As the >1200 lives is
dependent on several stages of the career over the next 25 years. It's
not like you can work it out a little and figure out much better
estimates of the personal fit. A personal fit of of 57% is required
for it to match the 'total' of a job at an EAO. With 1 years effort I
can know if I got scholarship in top 20. I would still be at a
personal fit of 25% and far from competing with 'working at an EAO'.

Although an MC is great in CC, I am not sure how it translates when I
would like to work for an EAO. In any case based on the personal fit
(i.e., probability of success) a DS would still beat an MC as the
number of lives saved has been assumed to be the same when working at
an EAO. 

At this moment it appears that MC of any form is not favourable even
with a few years of going further with the career due to the large
uncertainity and seemingly better option of 'DS for DW'. And as said
earlier, even if I spent time to see how far I get with 

So becoming partner is far fetched. Even if I went as far as finishing
my MBA successfully, my other options now are to work for some
organization (with an impact of 700 lives) or join an EAO (with an
impact of >970 lives). I am not sure why I would go with any of these
two options as DS with an EAO track seems more possible with similar
impact levels. 

There by it appears that MC is not worth pursuing just for the CC
alone, as impact estimated along with the personal fit, can be
obtained by other means with much more confidence.

#### Eliminating 

Having eliminated Starting up, Econ Phd with rare chance and IB, I see
that MC all variations of an MC career at low in the table.

This I think is mainly due to the personal fit. For example, becoming
a partner at a top agency is going to be really hard, even for the top
brains, and I estimated that probability to be 1%. Even if you save
1000 lives, it is still not the right move for you, as the net result
is looked at `0.01x1000=10 lives`

Getting an MC is so hard already that the even if there are back up
options, the personal fit is still low. This does not make any more
sense and hence until the personal fit is revised this does not seem
to make sense.

#### Calculating impact of direct working in 80k-hours

In this appendix the goal is to calculate number of lives saved by
working in an EAO. It is first attempted to estimate the impact of a
researcher at 80k-hours-EAO. This is checked against an estimate from
a researcher from GiveWell. Further this value is reflected upon
considering replaceability of a researcher in a job and effective
impact is agreed upon.

**The calculation** 

80k-hours-EAO has redirected 3k people to improve their good doing
through their interventions, over 7 years, i.e., 375
career-redirected-people/year. It is assumed that all the
career-redirected-people would atleast be able to save 200 lives each
(by working in an ordinary DE job and donating 10%) over their
lifetime. So a total impact of `428 x 200 = 85600` lives saved, per
year.

Contribution of the entire EAO is expected to be 20% (conservative
estimate based on [this](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/peter-hurford/)) of the total lives saved. An EAO runs on
donations, so the donors contribution also needs to be
factored. Contribution of the EAO is expected at 40%([GiveWell
estimate](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/))) compared to the donors. The EAO shall thus be able to
save `= 20% x 40% x 75000 = 10,272` lives per year.

An analyst in the first year would contribute about 0.18%: There are
about 15 people excluding advisors, 2 co-founders, 6 core members, 3
freelancers and 4 operations people in 80k-hours-EAO. In the first
year assuming my contribution is [10%](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) of the co-founder, core team
at 30% and operations team at 10%, my contribution would be 1.8% of
the entire EAO. In addition to this, contribution from the analyst
when he is replaceable is expected to reduce contribution by 90%
([GiveWell analyst estimate](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/)). This brings the contribution of an
analyst **= 1.8% x 10% = 0.18%**. The total number of lives saved by
an analyst in his first year at 80k-hours-EAO is `= 0.18% x 9000 =
18.5` lives in the first year.

Assuming one can keep up with this, with:
	- 4% growth per year
	- 2% growth per year after 50
	- 7% growth every 5-7 years
	- inflation in the cost of saving lives 2%
	- Cost of a life now, 4k$
	- All this for the next 40 years

This comes to about 500 lives in total as the contribution of an
analyst in an EAO like 80k-hours. It is to be noted that some of the
numbers are largely conservative, such as the average number of lives
saved is at 200. This is assuming a 10% pledge at a salary of
53k$. This is a very basic salary and everyone who is intervened by
80k-hours, should be expected to do more. Also the rate at which
80k-hours is making career changes for people is rapidly
increasing. Over the last 2 years it has been ~1k career-changes. Our
assumption of the career changes factors in the time from when they
actually started in 2011.  If we take the number of career changes to
be 1k, then the total number of lives saved by the above calculation
goes to 1140 lives saved over a life time. So for now it said that
500-1000 lives is estimated to be saved as an analyst.

[An analyst from GiveWell](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) has made this calculation (from which I
have heavily referenced) including the replaceability of 10%, and he
claims a contribution in the first year of ~97k$.

Assuming one can keep up with this, with:
	- 4% growth per year
	- 2% growth per year after 50
	- 7% growth every 5-7 years
	- inflation in the cost of saving lives 2%
	- Cost of a life now, 4k$
	- All this for the next 40 years
	
Extrapolating over the next 40 years would save 1400 lives. So in
summary it appears that a lot of lives can be saved based on the reach
of the EAO (conservatively >500 with potential of greater than 1.4k)

**Reflection**

I feel like I have been heavily hoping for this answer to turn out
ridiculously large say in k's of people saved. But its only 2-3x
more in the conservative case, than the impact of just being a
design engineer. I want to say *JUST* 2x more, but allow me to wash
my mouth.

It is not the difference between 200 and 600 Indian rupees my dear
friend, it is the goddamn difference between 25 million to 75
million $ in value, and that too just for one year freaking year of
quality human life. (My internal bells just went off! Essay writing
you rock). Agents are in general extremely scope insensitive it
appears. As Elezer says, we need to[ "shut up and
multiply"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity). Shut up and multiply has never been so resounding
inside my head. A year later after reading about it I see myself
making the mistake. 

<!-- This does not belong, here, it needs to be pushed somewhere
else -->

In the discussion above it has been assumed that because we are
replaceable, we loose 90% of the value added by us to the EAO. This
resulted in a multiplying the numbers of lives saved by an additional
10% and hence estimate to save 500 to 1500 lives as a result.

Recently I came across an argument regarding ["Why I am not
replaceable"](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#why-is-working-at-an-ea-organisation-high-impact), in the 80k-hours-guide. And it argued that if I take
up job at an EAO, then I free up the other person who is "supposed to
replace me" to do good elsewhere, as most organizations are talent
constrained rather than funding constrained. So there are X analyst
jobs and X-1 analysts. So in essence everyone worthy can get a job and
claim the impact of that particular job for himself without factoring
in the replaceability. Furthermore, If you don't take up the job, the
organization might not fill the role for some time.

And in that case the GiveWell estimate would go from 97k to 970k/year,
and the number of lives saved would go from 1400 to 14000. Wow!

But,

At this point we have a couple of estimates regarding what is the
value created by an Analyst over his lifetime. The estimate computed
by me suggests a lower bound of 500 lives.  Factoring the non
replaceability, this goes to 5000 lives. The givewell analyst's
estimate turned out to be ~1500 lives. and lastly, by asking how much
funding the EAO would have traded we have a rough estimate of ~1000
lives taking the median value of 77k$/year. The last number seems to
be neither too conservative not too non-conservative and it is what we
shall go on further with to compare working at EAOs with other career paths. 

P.S

The whole [Indirect effects](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) is not taken into account at all.

#### Calculating the impact of working in design engineering

I estimate the impact of being an engineer as
 - Total donations per annum (20% of 46k$)
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 40
 - Increase in salary = 4% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 10% increase
 - 20% donation per year
 - = <200
 
 
I estimate the impact of starting up in tech to be
 - Total donations per annum (60% of [2.5m$](https://80000hours.org/2014/05/how-much-do-y-combinator-founders-earn/#fn:5))
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 40
 - Increase in salary = 5% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 12.5% increase
 - ~38k lives
