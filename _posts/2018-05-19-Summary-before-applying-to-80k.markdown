## Reading this essay

This essay is filled with abbreviations. Just like in any sane
article, the abbreviations are explained the first time only. In case
you skip sections or forget what an abbreviation would mean, you can
find all the abbreviations in the appendix at the end of the post.

## Entry question:

The Goal with this essay is to identify/estimate the career direction
I need to take in the coming months focusing on impact.

## Impact

In one of the earlier essays, we concluded on what is important to
us. We came to the conclusion that human lives are very important to
us. In fact nothing else seemed to matter other than maximizing the
saving of lives. This is the impact we should run after.

<!-- Link missing -->

### What can I do to create large impact? (broadly)

One can either earn-to-give (ETG), or do direct work, and if highly unsure
about the future improve their skills and build career capital with the
goal being to maximize saving lives. Earning-to-give needs no
explanation. An example of direct work (DW) would be to work for an
NGO that stages interventions to help the poor get back upon their
feet. Working in Management consulting (MC) would be a way to keep
building flexible Career Capital (FCC) which will allow later to take
up different types of jobs in different industries.

In addition to these one can also perform advocacy - the promotion of
solutions to pressing problems. For example, in addition to or instead
of earning yourself, you could inspire/persuade a friend to pursue ETG
as well. I don't plan to discuss advocacy right now in detail. I hope
to take it up on another post at another time as I don't see it having
much consequence for me at this time. Of course we should do
everything we can to get others to also pursue Effective Altruism (EA).

The 80k-hours guide features several career-reviews that they
recommend us to pursue and profiles of people who they consider to be
high impact causers. From this we can derive what is possible within
this world, what have other high impact causers done, and what are
some possible careers that might make sense for us. This would allow
for further fine-tuning later in the essay.

A small side note: This essay heavily relies on the 80k-hours guide. I
have dealt with why we should use the work of 80k hours in the
appendix.

<!-- todo why 80k hours is the shizz -->

#### Earning-to-give 

A career in ETG might include one of the following:

- **An investment banker** who will earn in millions and give away >50% of
his salary.

- A **Management Consultant** who will earn > 250k$ and
  give away >30%
  
- A **Data scientist/Project Management** who will earn 200k$ (in 5-10
  years) and give as much as possible
  
- A **Programmer** who will earn 200k$ (in a few years) and give as much as
  possible

- Taking up **Entrepreneurship** although with very small chance of
  success, has the potential to cause major influence with earning,
  advocacy and direct work.
  
[Ben West](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/ben-west/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentwest/)) an entrepreneur (with the guidance in
career from 80k-hours) is expected to donate millions to charity. He
is going to keep a minimum wage for himself and donate the rest of his
salary.

Ben West is a fantastic and inspiring example of someone who is going
to ETG. There is a lot of luck involved in such a career, but
nevertheless, it is the attitude that is at praise here - A person who
can earn millions saying he will keep minimum wage.

<!-- Amazing, he can even say things like this! -->

#### Direct working  

>80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should
>earn to give long term. We think that most people should be doing
>things like politics, policy, high-value research, for-profit and
>non-profit entrepreneurship, and direct work for highly socially
>valuable organizations.

- Found &/or Lead or manage Effective Altruism organizations to be
  most impactful. Some inspiring profiles covered by 80k-hours in this
  area of direct work, below:
  
  [Tara Macaulay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)), was (then) head of operations (now
  CEO) in the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA). Tara has always been
  outstanding at her work, be it with saving money for her company or
  rising the ranks very fast. She has apparently left a lasting impact
  in Bhutan where she worked on direct impact projects.*She interned
  without pay at CEA* showing great leadership skills and then rose the
  ranks to become the current CEO. She has no MBA degrees and infact
  only has a pharma degree but that hasn't stopped her. The CEA gets a
  lot of funding (in millions) which it directs to worthy applicants
  that can create large impact.

[Rob Mather](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-mather-b0331235/)), is the CEO of Against Malaria
foundation (AMF) - critically acclaimed as one of the most effective
organizations by GiveWell. He has had top education, and possibly an
all-the-time high achiever who went to Harvard Business School and
University of Cambridge. The AMF saves millions of lives a year.

[David Goldberg](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/david-goldberg/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjonathangoldberg/)), co-founder of Founders Pledge,
that makes Tech entrepreneurs legally bounded to donate in case their
startups succeed. He is definitely another all-the-time high achiever,
who went to Cambridge, but has a degree in philosophy. He has done
everything other than continuing with philosophy.

>Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance in the US, started
>and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
>in California. All in, a pretty bizarre career trajectory if I’m
>honest, which was largely the result of having no clear idea of what
>I wanted to do with my life until recently.

But now he has focused all of his might into the Founders Pledge to
create high impact.

  <!-- Seems to be a scope to intern at these places (seems to be -->
  <!--       working based on availability) -->

We saw a few different profiles, each of them doing amazing things in
a joint effort to save as many lives as possible

- Be an Analyst/researcher at Effective Altruism Organizations (EAOs)
   such as GiveWell or 80k-hours

In organizations like GiveWell, 80k-hours, CEA etc... they need people
to write useful content in an understandable way and they need people
to research what programs are effective and most impactful. In other
words, solving problems with limited data, knowing what type of data
is interesting, and presenting it in clear manner, is done by analysts
or researchers. Here the main criteria are strong critical thinking
skills, statistics and Mathematics.

Most of the EAO's have very few people (10-30), funneling or creating
impact in the order of millions of dollars. As an analyst you could
already [make an impact of 97k$ a year](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/).

- Working in Policy

This involves, shaping the policy of governments to impact a population of a city,
state, country or world. 

For example, an Economics PhD working with the government, will
[sometimes have the chance to impact a large population](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) by
influencing policy based on logic and numbers. Although these chances
are rare an Econ Phd is still considered one of the best PhD's to
pursue (I guess owing to the impact).

[Niel Bowerman ](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/niel-bowerman/) ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielbowerman/)), previously the Assistant Director
of Future of Humanity Institute, studied at Oxford University,
is another outstanding talent featured in the 80k-hours website. He
does not have an MBA, he is a physics major, previously handling
fundraising, operations management etc... And now he is the head of AI
policy for 80k-hours. With this he is able to guide potential
candidates in the right direction to assist in mitigating the [risks
of AI](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/).

**Lessons learnt:**

- According to 80k-hours DW must be pursued by most of the people as
EAO's are usually not talent constrained

- *Most of the featured profiles in the 80k-hours website do not have
an MBA*. Everyone has shown definite signs of greatness from the
beginning and looking at their profile, they are headed for more
greatness.

- Being in EAOs seems to allow to achieve a large impact (quantified later)
  
#### Advocacy

Advocacy is the promotion of solutions to pressing problems leading to
impact. All the work is judged by impact. A simple form of advocacy,
is when you convince your friend about ETG. By doing this you increase
your impact by a lot.

#### Building career capital

Career Capital (CC) broadly talks about the skills, connections,
credentials and runway to allow for us to take on high impact tasks
later. The greater the CC the better. Better skills roughly translates to better
output, more chance of learning and even more chance of making lot of
impact. In Sales, the more you sell the more the money you take
home. Better your sales skills are, better you are able to make more
money which can be donated to make maximum impact, for example.

When we are young and we don't know what problem we should be working
on or where we can create a lot of impact, then flexible career
capital (FCC) comes in handy. In an attempt to keep options open for
us to move to the problem we can address later, we should consider
FCC. For example, if one does an MBA and goes into management
consulting for the next few years, the exit opportunities are
aplenty. A management consultant after a few years of work has wide
scope for working in different industries, in some cases there is
scope for direct work, in the best case he can become partner and
donate a lot of money for the rest of his life to make the best
impact.

Although ultimately we might be ETG or doing DW, when we are young it
is advised to focus on gaining flexible career capital to allow us
flexibility in the job market and to be useful in different domains as
needed by the then important focus areas.

It is something that does not take you to a dead end. For example,

>It’s widely accepted in the non-profit sector that it’s easier to
>switch from a business job to a non-profit job than vice versa. So if
>you’re unsure between the two, a business position offers more
>flexibility.

So jobs, that will continue to be useful in different industries and
likely to remain useful in the future. Jobs that allow you to gain
skill that can later be transferred to other jobs are the types of
work we should be interested in early career I guess.

[Dillon Bowen](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/dillon-bowen/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dillon-bowen-409791a1/)) is working
towards his Economics PhD based on the counseling he got from
80k. Economics PhD is highly recommended graduate program by
80k-hours guide, due to the high impact in direct working. Such a PhD
allows for jobs in academia (which have a unique way of doing DW), you
can go into Management Consulting, or you can join the government and
work in helping policy formation. So it allows you the CC to decide
later to either ETG, DW in policy or in academia based on what is the
best for you at that time in your life. 

 <!-- TBW, He has no MBA, as a result. -->

[Peter Huford](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/peter-hurford/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhurford8/)), taught himself how to program from
political science background that now, he is improving his skills in
business, programming and finance and also having extra time to work
on other charity projects. Peter seems to be a great example of one
who is building great FCC.


  <!-- * [ ] Appears that I should follow something like this, and talk to -->
  <!--       Herman maybe, as the spending time on an MBA to do some IB is -->
  <!--       not really seeming to be required. A better understanding or -->
  <!--       working or creation of new things can increase the outcome 10 -->
  <!--       fold in no time. I think I should just focus on things like -->
  <!--       this and get better and become really skillful. -->


#### Summary

The importance of direct work has been stressed a lot by 80k-hours. In
the long run that is what I guess I should be doing. But for the next
few years, no harm in making money as well as building career
capital. But money is not the objective, getting yourself in shape to
do good is; Gaining skills to make crazy impact is. The different
examples of people creating their best impact shows what is possible
and how reasonable to keep the expectations, I guess. I would like to
be like these people, high-achieving and high-impact causing. I need
to carefully evaluate the different options that are available.

I will also be evaluating where I can create most impact based on the
different paths that I take, considering the success and failure
scenarios. The next section attempts to discuss based on the
80k-career-guide, what career options to choose from and how to
evaluate different options based on what is important for you.

## Finding the right career for you

Based on [the 80k-hours guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/) we first make a list of options,
then compare it with different parameters and at last write out our
key uncertainities and look at how to deal with them.

<!-- Making a list of options -->

**Making a list of options** by using these questions: What do you
want to do in life? Provide exact examples of profiles that you would
like to be like? What are the different career paths you think are
available to you? Give one way how you would achieve it?

<!-- Rankingish your options --> 

**Comparing different options** based on Skills, Connections,
Credentials, Runway, & Personal fit, job satisfaction, Impact

<!-- Write out key uncertainities -->

**Write out your key uncertainities:** What are the things that you
are uncertain about? Can you quickly test
them? Are they going to change your ranking largely?


### Making the list

Making a list according to 80k-hours sounds far-too-specific like
"economics researcher focusing on global health", "marketing for meat
substitutes" etc...

As I am still young and agile, I am only looking to build fCC of
course with a focus that I will be able to make large impact later. I
I have no idea on what exact problem I would like to work or I would
best fit in. So, the focus is on the choice of direction for **the
next few years**.

Furthermore if I miss something, I would like to put the onus on my
reviewers of this essay a.k.a the 80k community, an STM and the
decision tool to point it out.

#### Career Quiz: recommended list of careers

The [80k-hours career guide has a career-quiz](https://80000hours.org/career-quiz/#/) of 6 questions based
on which you get a few career recommendations.

The **Career Q&A**

1. Could you become good at math, science or logic?
Yes (outperform 80% of graduates)

2. Could you become good at writing and speaking? 
Yes (Outperforming 80% of graduates in a humanities subject)

3. Are you happy betting on a small chance of a big impact?
No

4. Are you happy trying to work in the most demanding fields?
Yes

Challenging and long hours should not be a problem I suppose. I have
seen evidences of this in my past, with my master thesis(10-14 hrs a
day, programming, reading), with my work in IIT Madras (easily clocked
10 hrs or more a day for 1 year atleast), Courses in my masters
etc... and for a few months worked on writing on the blog and
researching at home  5) How far through your career are you?

Early (27) finished masters and working for ~2 years

6. How do you want to contribute? 

All possible ways: Direct, indirect, earning to give, research etc...

**And the output is:**

- Policy oriented Civil services
- Economics PhD
- Data Science (skill building and earning to give)
- Working at effective non-profites
- Machine learning PhD
- Software engineering (skill building and earning to give)
- Trading in quantitative hedge funds

When we are ready to bet on small chances then the output changes to:

- Congressional staffer
- Policy oriented Civil services
- Machine learning PhD
- Working at effective Altruist organizations
- Founding effective non-profits
- Data science
- Party politics

In addition to the above, I also would like to evaluate the current job I
am working at now, difference between working at the US and in
Netherlands, and if the career can somehow lead to Direct Work.

#### Comparing

The following parameters are used to compare each career path:
	
- Career Capital
  - Skills
  - Connections 
  - Credentials
  - Career Capital

- Personal Fit

- Job satisfaction or supportive conditions

- Impact

Following this, I could use the decision making chart and the decision
tool of the 80k-hours website to do the same to determine the result.

**Career Capital**

Skills:

>Skills – what will you learn in this job, and how fast will you
>learn? You can break skills down into transferable skills, knowledge
>and personality traits. Some especially useful transferable skills
>include: personal productivity, analysis and problem-solving, the
>ability to learn quickly, decision-making, social skills, and
>management. We cover why and how to learn them in a later article. If
>you want to do good, you also need to learn all about the world’s
>most pressing problems and how to solve them. A job will be best for
>learning when you are pushed to improve and get lots of feedback from
>mentors. - [80k hours Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

The current plan is to focus on FCC.

Will the job allow me FCC? 

Will it give me important skills like programming, Data-science which
can be transferred over a wide variety of industries.

Connections:

>Connections – who will you work with and meet in this job? Your
>connections are how you’ll find opportunities, spread ideas and start
>new projects. The people you spend time with also shape your
>character. For both reasons, it’s important to make connections who
>are influential and who care about social impact. - [80k hours Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

Are my connections going to get me jobs in different industries or
other industries?

Are my connections going to inspire me to do good?

Are my connections influential?

Credentials:

> Will this job act as a good signal to future collaborators or
> employers? Note that we don’t just mean formal credentials like
> having a law degree, but also your achievements and reputation. If
> you’re a writer, it’s the quality of your blog. If you’re a coder,
> it’s your GitHub. -[80k hours Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

Runway:

>how much money will you save in this job? Your runway is how long you
>could comfortably live with no income. It depends on both your
>savings and how much you could reduce your expenses by. We recommend
>aiming for at least six months of runway to maintain your financial
>security. 12-18 months of runway is even more useful because it gives
>you the flexibility to make a major career change. It’s usually worth
>paying down high-interest debt before donating more than 1% per year
>or taking a big pay cut for greater impact. -[80k hours Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

Ability to quickly save enough money for the next 18 months is what
seems to be defining runway. How much I can donate is a question
answerd by the impact section. Runway seems to be always important.


**Impact**

Number of lives saved is the ultimate variable we are interested
in.

In order to determine the effective impact of pursuing a career, we
should do more than just multiply the impact with the personal fit. We
should look at it like a decision tree. If we succeed our impact is
say X. If we fail our impact will be Y. Therefore,

Effective impact = Personal fit x X + (1-Personal fit) x Y

**Supportive conditions**

- Engaging work
- Colleagues
- Basic needs
- fit with rest of life

> Impact and personal life Engaging work - Will you get freedom to
> decide how to work, clear tasks, clear feedback and variety in what
> you do?  Colleagues- Will you like them and will they support you?
> basic needs- Will you earn enough money, will the hours be
> manageable, and will the commute be reasonable?  Fit with rest of
> your life -– Will you be able to improve your personal
> relationships, and uphold any other important personal priorities?
> -[80k hours Career Capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)

**Personal Fit**

What are your chances of excelling in that area?

**In total**

	$ (f1 x Career Capital +f2 x Impact +f3 x supportive conditions) *
	Personal fit
 
>If you are still early in your career, then it’s best to place
>greater importance on career capital than on role impact

>The more uncertain you are about the long-run, the more you should
>prioritise flexible career capital over

>The more altruistically-minded you are, the less weight you’ll need
>to place on job satisfaction relative to the other factors.

80k suggests role-impact and not impact. This would mean that I
somehow have an idea of what problem I have chosen to focus on. On a
high level, it is all about saving lives, adding good years to lives
around the world now and later.

To simplify the solving of the above problem, I suggest we just stick
to impact as being saving lives. I will try to make estimations of
saving lives with this. The value of these factors are explained later.

[Source: how to compare different careers ](https://80000hours.org/articles/framework/#questions-for-assessing-each-factor) 

Instead of rejecting a low-personal-fit-high-impact career, what if we
took it and played our chances. In case we win, we gain huge impact, if
we loose, we can pick still make decent effort.


	Effective impact = Personal fit x X + (1-Personal fit) x Y

So we will look at Effective impact.

### Evaluating different profiles

With this section I hope to take each career path, and evaluate it
based on the parameters from the last section. In the end I would have
a table for different career paths in the rows and the parameters in
the columns. For each of the parameters, I come up with a number
usually from 1-10, based on the points I make in favor of or against
the career path.


#### Design engineering for ETG

I am currently a Design Engineer in the precision industry. The
function of such an engineer is to design parts/products to the
specifications provided, verify and assemble them.  Here the following
cases are evaluated in this profile:

- Design Engineering in NL/Europe
- Design Engineering in US
- Design Engineering to Sales in NL

<!-- going to the US with DE might be possible but I suspec only with -->
<!-- L1 I will make a separate post out of it -->

**Skills**:

- Not very challenging all the time, not pushed to do more and given
  only a small amount of feedback.

I work for ~40 hrs a week in NL and I am barely at any pressure or
pushed to achieve great things. Learning in general is slow. I suspect
that there will be more pressure in the US or if I move to Sales, but
there is a lot of paper work to do in general, in addition to the lack
of challenging problems given to you for solving

- Small percentage of critical thinking

Critical thinking is about 20-30% of the time . Most of the time I am
not working on hard problems. I am doing a lot of work that does not
translate necessarily to improvement of my skill such as making small
modifications to existing setups, or covering for poor procedures
written by others.

- Not very valuable even with 30 years of experience

>For the first five to ten years in this position, salary increases
>somewhat, but any additional experience does not have a big effect on
>pay. - [payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Design_Engineer/Salary)

- Decent transferable skills

I will have quite some knowledge of the Semicon industry, maybe a good
chance to port to Sales, So I think it does offer some sort of FCC
(flexible Career capital). Even within the company I work for they
were looking for normal people to shift to management side provided
they had a few years of experience. I have seen the useless nutheads
in sales who do not understand the product and have no idea what it
can do, still pitch it to others and try to make a sale. I think I
would be a welcome relief to such an industry needing solid engineers
who can also talk.

Although I am not sure of why going into automotive or space might be
interesting, moving to other such industries might be hard or
impossible. I have seen people move from other industries to precision
engineering, but not the other way around. I suspect going the other
way might need a lot of pre-knowledge, and current knowledge might
just not be fully portable. So I will have to stay in Precision
engineering for ever. With regard to ETG, I don't see it as a big problem.

This job is usually not intense and has a long development cycle, so
work hours are not too long, allowing us time to learn other things
and improve in the areas needed. But learning more about design seems
to only come with more experience in the field, rather than reading
about things.

I don't expect the resulting skills to be very much different between
here and the US. A decent amount of transferable skills, the minimum
quantity of critical thinking, a decent amount of creativity while
working seems to result in a skill rating of 6.5/10.

**Connections**:

I work with other design engineers and physicists in the job. I might
be able to find opportunities in related fields using these
contacts. As I am mostly working with only my team, it doesn't give me
opportunities to meet top players in the industry. As a result  the
connection rating is at 4/10.

**Credentials**:

For a writer it is his blog, for a coder it is his Github, for a
mechanical deisgner, it is his portfolio of work done till now,which
would help find other jobs in the same industry. Jumping jobs is
sometimes the best way to get a raise. I see myself growing up the
ladder very very slowly (4-5 years per promotion). It is a slow
working environment (mainly because of the long development
cycles). Right now maybe I can boast to future precision companies
regarding what I do at my current employer. Moving within the
precision engineering industry should not be a problem, but I think it
stops with that. I would put DE at a rating of 6/10 for credentials.

**Runway**:

I can't move immediately into sales or even to the US. The runway for
all the cases will correspond to what I earn at DE in NL. It is
estimated for 18months worth of dough, 2-3 years of saving is
required. An average rating of 5/10 is given here.

<!-- Ways of moving to the US and prolty estimates unknown, but runway -->
<!-- could be crazy, but I still suspect I need to clock a few good -->
<!-- years here before I am able to migrate reasonably-->

**Personal Fit**:

To excel in this area would mean, 

- I can be a typical engineer for the rest of my life and grow through
  the ranks slowly. This is like the minimum I should be able to
  achieve at any cost. I estimate this at 95% chance of success for
  me.
  
- There seems to be a decent opportunity into sales. But is sales a
good fit for me? I suspect I can be good at it. I have seen random
people move into sales and succeed. My cousin was an ordinary
Mechanical Engineer who rose the ranks in sales and now ears lots of
money in Dubai. Another cousin moved from electrical engineering
(brainy guy though) and managed a killer career that got him to a US
green card directly. Considering that Sales can make more money, I
should atleast try a brief stint in it. I can always fall back to DE
as and when I like. I expect the chance of success to be 75%.

- Moving to the US

  There are a couple of ways I go to the US, either by direct applying
  or by migrating from one country to the other via an L1 visa.  <!--
  Also possibly go to Canada and follow the L1 route --> In 5 years
  time I would expect to have worthy experience with which I can try
  for a switch to the US. By then I would have an NL Citizenship and
  if things don't work out in the US, I can always fall back into
  holland and do what I do.
  
  - Chance of becoming really good in DE (80%)
  - Chance of managing an L1 or getting selected directly (60%)
          
So in total: 80%*60% = 48% of success.

**Impact**:


>Most people move on to other jobs if they have more than 20 years'
>experience in this career. Experience has a moderate effect on pay
>for this job.- [Payscale-mechanical-engineering](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Engineer/Salary)

- The impact of being a typical engineer for the next 40 years in NL is
estimated to be ~200 lives based on:

	- Salary raise of 4% per year for the next 40 years
	- 10% increase every 5 years
	- 20% donation
	- increase of 2%/year on the cost of lives
	- beginners salary of 53k$

- The impact of moving into sales can probably significantly switch
things up, conservatively I guesstimate it at atleast 2 times the
impact of full time DE. Yes I am pulling these numbers almost out of
my ass, as I don't have good estimates of it. I will refine this
number later if needed. Resulting in 400 lives.

- The impact of moving to the US could be much better as the pay is
reasonably higher.

	- Salary raise of 4% per year
	- 10% increase every 5 years
	- 20% donation
	- increase of 2%/year on the cost of lives
	- for a beginners salary of 100k
	- 2% increase in salary from 50 years of age
  
280 lives in the US for 35 years + 13 lives for the first 5 years in
NL = ~300 lives.

**Personal fit x Impact**

- DE in NL

		95% x 200 = 190

This is the minimum I can do and so the rest of the 7% wouldn't
matter. 

- DE followed by sales

I can briefly try sales and if all hell brakes loose then I can always
move back in DE. Considering such a tree we get:
		
		75% x 400 = 300	
		75% x 400 + 25% x 95% x 200 ~= 350 
		
- DE in US

Just like in sales, I can always move back to being a DE in Nl. 
		
		48% x 300 = 144
		48% x 300 + 52% x 95% x 200 ~= 248


**Conclusion DE ETG**

With the above calculations we see that DE in NL might be better than
DE in US if we do not consider the decision tree, but if we do
consider the decision tree, it turns out that trying it would still be
better than just being a DE in NL.

We could make the Decision tree even more complicated, with many
branches etc... to work out other situations. But for now, it appears
that trying Sales and US options could be good options to get myself
into, as opposed to a traditional job.

#### Design engineering (Machine Design) in 'Europe' for Direct work

**Skills**: 

- Lot of skills not useful in DW

	Right now I am learning a very specific amount of skills. Skills
	related to making proper drawings, how to design for the precision
	industry, how to keep things simple etc... Great for the precision
	engineering market but I dont think it preps me for the Leadership
	or research type of jobs that would be needed in DW.

- gaining management skills takes a long while before it even begins

	Even if I become a design leader (as they call it here), it would
	take say 5-8 years atleast (35), where I go into a tech leadership
	kinds of role, where I am managing a technical team, knowing on a
	high level what my team is doing.

- Not very challenging all the time, not pushed to do more or given a
lot of feedback

	I have already talked about this in the last section on 'DE for
	ETG'.  As an engineer I have to do a lot of unnecessary things,
	kind a like doing experiments manually. Time is really precious
	and you would want every single minute to count. I see myself
	'wasting' a lot of time here. I work for <40 hrs a week and I am
	barely at any pressure or pushed to achieve great things.

Overall, the dearth of transferable skills, minimum time spent on
critical thinking and a decent amount of creativity building gets it a
rating of 5/10.

**Connections**:

AS mentioned in 'DE for ETG', connections within the industry are
already not that great. Connections to move to DW or meeting people
interested in EA, is hard I observe. Thus rated as 3/10. 

**Credentials**:

Credentials wise I am very limited. The assignments given to me and
available in general don't allow you to boast crazy performance boosts
or high impact. I think I will not be able to boast any reasonable
achievements, other than my performance reviews, that can look good on
my application to GiveWell type EAOs. So I rate this at 5/10.

**Runway**:

In Netherlands I can save about 6-8k euros per year. Removing my
donation, and all other extra expenses that seem to be coming, I think
I can save about 6k per year. I can improve this if necessary by
4k/year by joining another company. Runway gathering takes a slow 3
years for saving for 18 months worth. An average rating of 5/10 is
given here.

**Supporting conditions**

Work is engaging, I can always find decent challenges. Basic needs are
met, colleagues seem to be fine and ready to help when you ask for
help. Work outside of DE towards the Direct Work can also be quite
engaging.

It is hard to find like minded people here who share any interest in
Altruism. Of all the people I have met, I do not know a single soul
who does anything related to EA. They are too busy chilling, going to
the beach, working and planning on pleasurable activities after
activities. 

<!-- Not that I am any great soul or something; Well ;)-->

**Personal Fit**:

To excel in this area would mean to somehow gain skills to
either found an NGO, or work in one in operations or research.

- chances of learning skills at the age of 33 within design
  engineering (85%)
- possibility of learning the right skills while spending time in this
  industry (70%)
  
  This is assuming I can learn in my ample available free time (14-22
  hrs).
  
- Getting a job in either research or management in top NGO's
  based on research or operations related credentials (70%)
  
  I don't expect it to be as tough as getting a job in MC. Plus I have
  quite some spare time on my hand. I could always look to improve my
  knowledge and skills. I would have 40 days of vacation every year,
  which I could really use to become better or even take internships.

So a total 42% chance of success.

**Impact**:

It is argued in the appendix that impact of working in an EAO is
estimated at >970 lives when we work for 40 years. That becomes: 

- 23 lives over the first 9 years in DE
- 970*7/8 if I work in the EAO for the next 35 years.
- total: 875 lives



**Personal fit x Impact**

Simply multiplying the personal fit and the impact.

	42% x 875 = 380
	
In case EAO doesn't work out we can always move back to 'DE in NL'

	42% x 875 + 58% x 95% x 200 = 480 

**Conclusion DE for DW**

With the intention of doing Direct Work, it still seems
alright. I don't think it gives me any special skills but it
gives me time (22hrs a week on avg), a citizenship, sabbatical leave
with which I can slowly and meticulously plot my way out of DE to
Direct work.

#### Data science 

With this section Data science (DS) is discussed in the following way:

- DS for direct Work
- DS for ETG in the NL
- DS for ETG in the US

**Skills**

- Nice set of skills for research and maybe management

Statistics, critical thinking, programming and machine learning could
be the knowledge and skills I would transfer to research based jobs,
and not necessarily leadership based jobs. However I suspect that a
role in project management after a few years could get me somewhere
like an all-rounder in the field of DS.

- High Flexible Career Capital according to 80k-hours-guide

>The technical skills you develop also open the possibility to
>transition into different roles including software engineering,
>founding or joining early-stage startups, academia, and quant
>finance. - [80k-DS](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/) 

DS is used in a many industries, including EA, offering FCC. Also DS
is only the starting point. Skills wise it looks like a great place to
start, with little effort. With very good skill I could move to NGO's (Direct impact potential)
as well. 

- Free time to develop additional skills

Once I start DS I suspect I have quite some time to do programming,
using different languages and focus on some high-risk paths like
starting up or even a machine learning PhD. Even if I am in the US,
working time is apparently ([reasonable and flexible hours](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/)).

- More valuable with more experience.
 
A good rating of 8/10 seems to be applicable for DS considering the
skills aspect.

**Connections**

Connections depends on where I am working and which type of company I
will be working for. For example working in a consultancy, might have
a great chance to meet many people and building the network. The
network as a result would be better than in DE. 

- Connections that further NGO opportunities: 4.5/10

- Connections that further DS in NL for earning to give: 5.5/10

- Connections that further DS in US for earning to give: 5.5/10

**Credentials**

DS has a fast paced scene, I gather from 80k-hours-guide. Faster
feedback cycle, and large connection between work and outcomes can be
felt. Further impression I get is that there it will be easy to obtain
bragable credentials. My belief that DS will give good credentials
combined with an uncertainty, leaves it at a rating of 7.5/10.

**Runway** 

DS in NL probably starts with a slightly higher salary than DE based
on estimates from Payscale DS's seem to earn ([46k€](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/05582c7c/Amsterdam) and design
engineers [40k€](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Design_Engineer/Salary)). This implies a faster runway than DE. DS in US
allows a more faster collection of the runway for 18 months. But in
any case right now it appears I will have to work in NL and slowly
plot my travel towards US or NGO's. So I suspect it to take about 2
years. So I will give it 7/10/

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

- For the most part it is engaging
- Cleaning up the data will be boring, it takes up a lot of time.
- Basic needs will be satisfied (money, hours and commute)
- Am not worried I will have too many problems learning or fitting in,
  my point being it is not investment banking.
- Again I look up to people in the US like my brother and other actual
  data scientists, they seem to have time to do other things as
  well. Not like they are working 24x7. Also 80k suggests that the
  hours are moderate 50 hrs per week I think. This is peacefully
  doable.
  
- Also this is expected to be a very satisfying career according to
  80k, due to the fast feedback cycle.

-Mentorship culture is quite common apparently according to 80k.

- project management could be even more fulfilling as it has more
control, more responsibility than analysts who are just the right hand
for project managers<!-- , just like my DL in DE -->.

It looks good overall, thus with a rating of 8/10.
  
**Personal fit**

Companies like KLM even have jobs for engineers and data
scientists. This could be quite lucrative for me and for the company,
as I span both the spectra. Anyone can jump into data science (we are
not talking about data core or machine learning). I have seen
colleagues of mine who were doing a masters with me and moved into
DS. The skills are basically stats, programming in python, R and SQL.
So personal fit wise, it is good here.

I am a fast learner and have worked on proper programming assignments
before. I have done a fair bit of critical thinking, hypothesis
forming and solving problems at work and my masters. I love it to
begin with and I think there is a lot of room to get better and I can
get better at it, with more defined ways of thinking.

I am up for challenging jobs all the time. I love programming and can
spend like any other sane human being a very large time working on it.

- DS as a means of earning to give (Netherlands)
  
  Here success would mean moving to a job in DS in NL from DE. This is
  to be followed by 40 years of work, with 20% of donations every
  year.
  
  I know a few of my colleagues who are in DS right out of a similar
  masters degree as I. Plus from everything I have seen it is a
  learn-able skill, and appears to be definitely learn-able.
  
  - 95% chance of entering into DS
  - 93% chance of working 40 years with 20% donations
  - In total, 88% chance of success
  
- DS as a means of earning to give (US)

  The career should probably look like this: I should be able to get
  jobs in europe within Google or Facebook and slowly plot my
  migration. I could also do a one year masters for example to move to
  the US.
  
  - Getting US worthy skills in 5 years time (80%)
  - Getting an L1 (65%) (This is a guess factoring uncertainty)
  - So in total: 95%x80%x65% = 47% of success.

- DS in NGO's

With good stats and quants capability, I think we might have a good
fit in analyst roles. There are also NGO's which use DS to do good,
like khan academy etc... If I spend enough time, I could already
manage a team and gain more FCC. So personally after 4-5 years (10k
hours of skill development) I suspect I should be quite
valuable.

- Chance to get into an NGO after 5 years in the realm of DS = 80%

Total chance = 95%*80% = 76%

**Impact**

DS in top companies seems to be earning people top dollars.  My friend
in the US earns 130-170k $ in Apple. Once you are Apple worthy, there
seems to be a lot of potential scope and growth. I have also heard the
pays in Facebook sometimes being about 200k $ with a few years of
experience. A simple bachelor's student in California in Data science
from a Waterloo university earns a base salary of 100k + stocks of 30k
a year. As far as I checked glassdoor and payscale, the pay in
Netherlands also seems to be higher than in DE. According to payscale
DS's seem to earn[ 53k](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/05582c7c/Amsterdam) and design engineers [40k](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Design_Engineer/Salary) €. Not able
to get proper estimates on glassdoor, but it looks high. Also DS is
heavily hyped by 80k-hours for its ability to quickly transform into
ETG.

>Data Incubator reports that its graduates can get starting salaries
>of $100K to $200K.

Bootcamps could be an option for me but I think some info that is
missing is that these people who succeed are not ordinary people. The
interview process itself is rigorous to get into, with these
bootcamps. But with skill it is possible to get lot of money for
ETG. Skills can be learned with time. I am not able to scoop it out
but, last time I saw on glassdoor, you are more valuable with
experience.

There is a lot of scope for direct impact if one has skills, by using
this science in companies like:

>the Center for Disease Control, Google, Khan Academy, Bayes Impact
>and DataKind.


- Working for DS now and staying in NL/europe for the next 40 years

	- With salary growth of 4% a year
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- and 20% donation
	- for a beginners salary of [53k from Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/05582c7c/Amsterdam)€ 
	
237 lives.

- Working for DS for the next 5 years and moving to the US

	- With compound interest of 4% a year
	- increase in salary of 2% after age 50
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- and 20% donation
	- for a beginners salary of 130k (based on salary of Bachelor's
      student from waterloo university in DS working at Facebook)
	  
	
367 lives for 35 years in the US + ~13 lives for the first 5 years in
NL= 400 lives.

- Working for DS now and moving to an NGO within the next 5 years.

I assume the same impact irrespective of the NGO joined. By definition
an NGO worth joining is for sure recommended by 80k-hours for example.
So my impact will be close to 970 lives.

**Personal fit x Impact**

- DS in NL


		88% x 237 = 208

In case DS fails I can always go back into DE.

		88% x 237 + 12% x 95% x 200 = 231
	
- DS in US 

	
		47% x 400 = 188

	In case DS in US fails I will try DS in NL and if that fails as
	well it would be DE in NL

		47% x 400 + 53% x (231) = 310

- DS in the pursuit of EAO

		76% x 970 = 738
	
	In case this fails, I can always fall back and pursue DS in NL.
	
		76% x 970 + 24% x (231) = 793
		
**Conclusion for DS**

DS in EAO is most lucrative if the numbers are right. This is
something that I should work on ensuring as this is turning out to be
a lucrative and promising career. DS in general is very good for CC as
well.

#### MBA into Management consulting

Finishing an MBA allows travel into a couple of venues, of which one
of them is MC. 80k-hours has done a [complete career profile on
them](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/). Based on [MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/), it appears that an MC does
just about anything that is needed to be done to improve the
performance of a company. The impression I get is that you are given
challenging problems and you have to come up with solutions for it.
Every few months you work on a new problem in teams and come up with a
solution.

**Skills**

Management consulting is hyped by 80k for its [career
capital](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/). They seem to offer sufficient transferable skills. You
actually work on different problems and become a generalist in an
industry with quite some exit opportunities:

>You can work in an industry you served as a consultant, venture
>capital, private equity, policy/civil service, work on a “strategy
>team” for a company. [Career Capital 80k-hours](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/)

You can pretty much do a lot with such exit opportunities. 

>Although a significant portion of your time will be spent on
>preparing powerpoint presentations, email, and “grunt” tasks, such as
>creating databases, junior consultants gain responsibility relatively
>quickly, and work on solving challenging business problems.

We spend more time and effort in this career and it appears to be
filled with great things in terms of CC such as learning, growth,
mentorship and regular feedback and working on tough problems to grow
along with the top performing peers. 80k hours values MC > DS
comparing career capital. These skills I am not sure I can gain say if
I work by myself at home. We rate it 10/10.

**Connections**

>An interviewee mentioned that the quality of the colleagues is
>generally seen as a major benefit of the job. Other alumni of the
>firm and contacts from individual projects give consultants a large
>number of valuable business contacts.

MC is all about consulting for big companies. You constantly have to
travel and meet with clients and deliver for them in their
locations. Projects are 2-3 months short and you have scope to get
lots of connections. Also, your colleagues around you are also
high-achievers and could be very valuable.

So I present this with 9/10. It seems like it is far apart from
anything I have seen before in either DS or DE. DS is also supposed to
be good connections. But I will say this, if MC's are the top
performers, if almost everyone can become Data Scientists, if MCs earn
more than DSs, if MC's connections are highly talked about by
80k-hours, if you know and work with your peers who are brilliant,
then MC seems to be much better than DS in terms of connections. OK I
will settle with an 8/10 considering DS is at 5.

**Credentials**

I think with MC you will make good credentials as you are solving
problems after problems in short time for the top 500. The exit
opportunities look aplenty, so I guess just knowing this is good
enough. Based on these I will put it slightly above DS.  8/10.

**Runway**

MC's earn [30-50% of what IB's earn](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/). At the associate level you
earn 80k to 170k. This would probably allow you to donate in the 30%
brackets. It should give enough runway right in the first year I think
assuming I do not have any more loans and shit. Runway is not
something I would be worried about if I was a Management consultant as
I would earning a 100k+ salary atleast.

For the next few years the time to accumulate runway will be the same
as for the job in DE in NL, which will result in 18 months.

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

There is good feedback and training. Job satisfaction appears to be
decent considering the challenging atmosphere and variety in work. I
am not sure 60 hour work days are really very bad. I think I can
manage it for a few years atleast. Also this is not as bad as in other
sectors like Finance. Even if things go wrong, if we try to sweat a
few years we can cash in on the exit opportunities as
possible. Support conditions are a bit weaker than in DS or DE. I will
keep it at a 7 as compared to 8 from DS.

**Exit opportunities**

If MC turns out to be not for you after a few years, then MC seems to
have decent exit opportunities. People move on to do various things,
not exactly like a demotion.

- Move to industry that you worked as a consultant 

>You can generally advance more quickly in industry by starting in
>consulting then entering industry several years later.

- policy/civil service but not sure how age plays a factor.
- VC / PE, If I can't handle MC and go to PE, then why will I choose
  PE, which seems to be even more demanding, depending on where you
  join.

**Personal fit**

- Earning to give

  - Chances of clearing getting >730 in GMAT (70%)
  - Chances of clearing the scholarship criteria for RSM after
    getting 730 (60%).
	
	I am not sure I have reasonable achievements for this and a
	serious lack of time to develop big achievements. But with a nice
	story on the CV and a good Recommendation maybe it is still
	possible.
	
  - MC jobs are highly competitive and 80k-hours-guide suggest to
    attach a 50% probability with it with getting a job once you
    graduate.
	
  - Chances of staying within MC >5 years (60%)
  - Chances that I will deal with 60 hrs of work (85%)
  
  - There is a[ 1/8th chance of making it to partner](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/#job-satisfaction)(12.5%) by age
    45, which brings down the personal fit quite a bit.
    
  So a total of : 1.3% 
  
- Earning to give once we leave industry after 5 years (ETG taking the
  exit opportunities in MC)
  
  - Similar chances as above still apply.
  - Chance of clearing GMAT and getting a scholarship still make sense
    (42%)
  - Chance of getting the top MC job (50%)
  - Chance of getting a job that is paying similar to DS (70%)
  
  >You can generally advance more quickly in industry by starting in
  >consulting then entering industry several years later

  If I was able to come this far, I assume from there on it is easy to
  get a job and advance more quickly in the industry. I don't know how
  much I can earn, but I suspect it is atleast around 150k, which is
  like a normal salary in the US. All the big heads in big companies
  like Apple, Microsoft, Google are MBA degree holders. So push
  further, work hard and see where it takes us. Hence the probability
  of 70%.
  
 - In total 18.9%

- Working for an NGO after 3-5 years in MC

	I am not comeacross a wide variety of opportunities. Nor has
	80k-hours-mentioned Direct work exit opportunities. There are some
	chances of working say at the Gates Foundation or other NGO's. But
	it is barely clear how this would pan out or how an MC job would
	help in this case especially. The impact could be pretty high if
	we are able to work at NGO's like Gates foundation.

	So the chances pan out to be I think

  - Similar chances as above still apply.
  - Chance of clearing GMAT and getting a scholarship still make sense
    (42%)
  - Chance of getting the top MC job (50%)
  - Chance of getting into a the likes of Gates Foundation (70%)
  - In total it is 18.9%.

**Impact**

- [Earning to give (partner after 45)](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/#job-satisfaction)

	- At associate level we get 130k 
	- after 5 years 250k
	- after 7 years 450k
	- 600k + bonus after 7 more years say
	- Donating 40% ([Like this](https://qz.com/515655/this-couple-lives-on-6-of-their-income-so-they-can-give-100000-a-year-to-charity/) maybe)
	- inflation of 2%
	- retiring at 57
	- getting 75% last drawn for the rest of life (another 20 years
      atleast)
	- I didn't take into account the bonuses which is expected to be a
      lot more.

	We can expect to save upwards of 1250 lives

- Earning to give, once we leave MC in 5 years

	- With salary growth of 4% a year
	- 2% salary growth after 50
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- and 30% donation
	- for a beginners salary of 150k (assumption i.e., after quitting
      MC)
	  
  This gives about 635 lives + first years at MC gives 70 lives = 700  <!-- one thing I am not confident about
  is at the age of 40 I should be earning in millions, is that even
  possible? Raaam? rajesh -->

- Direct working potential

I assume the impact for now to be the same for all EAOs, including the
ones that might be relevant to MC. This brings us to 970 lives i.e.,
35 years of working in an EAO + ETG as an MC for the first few years.

**Personal Fit x Impact**

- MC with a focus on becoming partner

The decision tree with MC is tabulated above. The thing is I can try
for GMAT and Scholarship. It would cost me a year. I estimate the
chances as per earlier in the discussion of personal fit. I expect
that if I fail in a year then I already know that this is not for me
and I can get back to DS with a focus on direct giving, which has an
effective impact of 730.

Once I do my MBA and find that I don't have a job in the top
companies, I would be in a much better situation to evaluate what is
the course for me. As a minimum I say that I should be able to do
something that will get me on the road to DS or project management and
have a few years delayed route to EAO anyways. I reduce the value by
25% to account for the delays. Further, after 5 or 6 years of work in
case I decide to take the exit opportunities, such a career path has
the potential to save 700 lives, say with 50% of success. In the end
even after 20 years if I don't become partner then I suspect I can
meet the impact of taking an exit opportunity (700 lives). If I came
so far, I should be able to do that atleast I guess. The effective
value of such a decision tree becomes then: 651 lives.

This sums up the whole MC career I think. I think I should run these
numbers by someone to know if where I stand. I am not sure how good
are my chances to DW. I suspect they are poor even with the skills as
I gathered from my friends with an MBA. But it is for later
evaluation. Atleast I am not able to do it justice. Maybe that turns
the tables over. Not sure. Later!

As partner though you could earn a freaking lot. We will estimate
the impact later. But this is a path then for earning-to-give. And
in case you crash and burn, you still have exit opportunities and in
my case maybe a citizenship in NL to continue DE or DS.

Yeah I am not sure. I have tried to ask my friends what if I can get a
job, but it sounds too far fetched. Why would I slog so much to gain
some part of the capabilities to go into DW. I see DS as a direct
learning to jump as an analyst in NGO's. Becoming an MC in the top
tier firms seems very very hard. If my plan is to go there then that
is what I should do.

- Trying out MC in top firms by directly applying

	A quick search on LinkedIn shows that many people have move to
	consulting from engineering (without an MBA). These people are
	sometimes from the exact university I studied and with probably a
	similar technical knowledge as me. People from [applied

**Reflection**

So MC seems to have an unusually high skill offered, lot of
connections, limited potential to do direct work but crazy potential
for ETG. However considering personal fit and other things like my
wish/ability to do an MBA with a scholarship only, and to try be that
high-achiever that top MBA's need, I feel that I have less chance as
shown above. However trying it and succeeding could impact many more
lives with small loss in end result. And hence we look at the decision
tree and try to see the effective value looking at failure scenarios
as well. The effective value of such a decision tree is 673 lives.

{:.tablestyletwo}
| Crossroad             | Success | Other | #lives if Success | #lives if failure | EI: Success | EI: failure |
|-----------------------|---------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| GMAT                  | 70.0%   | 30.0% | NA                | 730               | 469         | 219         |
| Scholarship           | 60.0%   | 40.0% | NA                | 730               | 378         | 292         |
| McKinsey              | 50.0%   | 50.0% | NA                | 65%x700           | 368         | 263         |
| 5+ yrs & 60+ hrs/week | 51.0%   | 49.0% | NA                | 700               | 392         | 343         |
| Make partner          | 12.5%   | 87.5% | 1,250             | 700               | 156         | 613         |


The explanation of the numbers above is as follows: If I only succeed
all the way, then the impact I could create would be greater than 1250
lives over my lifetime. I think this is huge as compared to other
profiles. I could fail at different points in the decision tree. If I
fail to get a scholarship or if I fail getting a decent score in GMAT,
it would cost me a year in time. I can pick up my stuff and work
towards 'DS for DW', hence an impact of 730 lives. Taking small risks
now, seems like a good idea to better gauge what I am capable of. And
taking risks without much severe consequence can lead to doing
significant good. There is a 50% chance of getting a job at
Mckinsey. In case it doesn't work out then, it's not the end of the
world. I think I can still get to 'DS for NL', or look at other
consultancies or marketing etc... At this time I would be in a much
better position to evaluate what is the best direction for me to go
in. Let's say the impact in this case is 65% of taking one of the exit
opportunities in MC (its an optimistic guess). After working 5 years
if I realize that MC is not for me, I would take the exit
opportunities. The impact would then be 700 as calculated earlier for
'ETG taking exit opportunities in MC'. And in the last case if I push
further and still fail then I would still expect the impact to be 700
or greater. Going further in MC should only further my impact. And the
effective value of such a tree is 673 lives.

To boost my chances or to see if I am a fit for MC much earlier I
could also try to get a job directly. A quick search on LinkedIn shows
that many people have moved to consulting from engineering (without an
MBA and also from my same university). These people are sometimes from the
exact university I studied and with probably similar technical
knowledge as me. People from [applied physics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borisnaar/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top%3BRBPj%2FS4mQJuPekMFdt120Q%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top-search_srp_result&lici=Zcn778IiTcKe573Tp9BzjA%3D%3D) and [offshore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascal-smulders-00a9b665/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top%3BRBPj%2FS4mQJuPekMFdt120Q%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top-search_srp_result&lici=H2eQm%2BpGT22%2FhseUYpUDLQ%3D%3D)
who have done a wide variety of other things seem to have gotten in. A
[very talented systems engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo-hoogslag-49abba83/) and a person from aerospace
background from my university has gotten in. Most of the people I
immediately find online are people who are from un-related departments
only. But it feels like they have done some interesting things in
their life. I can spend a few months and try this as well before
starting anything. This way I could get some experience and see how I
fare in consulting. If all goes well, use this to do an MBA in a top
college and continue killing it.

I feel at many times that I might not be suited for it, as it is for
people who have been achieving all their life. I thought in the past,
that I could never get a 9 in my grades. I got many in the second year
of may masters. I never thought I was cut out for these things. I
thought in the past that my first job would be a disaster because I
knew nothing, I have been getting good evaluations until now. These
might not look like big achievements, but all I want to say that I
don't know my potential yet.

<!-- Maybe this shit should go to the analysis -->

#### MBA into IB/ Finance/ Trading/private equity 

Based on the end appendix, I assume IB, Finance, Trading and PE all to
be similarly build regarding all the parameters I am using to compare.

<!--  to to find something about the end appendix -->

**Skills**

Sufficient Exit opportunities in IB/PE. One can go to consulting
even. Skills in finance can apparently be earned within 6
months. After that it is a mudane job. Skills are good enough to
transfer jobs even to MC and likely many more exit opportunities
occur. 8.5/10.

**Connections**

Unlike MC, [Investment banking on the other hand](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/152549/working-for-mckinsey-bain-and-boston-consulting-vs-goldman-jpm-and-morgan-stanley) is work in front
of a PC most of the time and meeting clients does not happen very
often especially within the first few years.
 
 6/10
 
**Credentials**

I think with MC/IB you will make good credentials. You are making
crazy money, you have IB written on your resume. If you can move from
IB to MC, then I conclude it has sufficient credentials. 8/10.

**Runway**

After getting into IB runway might be crazy, but until then, the same
runway as in DE or DS exists holds. 7/10.


**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

- Need to kiss ass
- Need to [face time](https://thetab.com/2015/12/21/face-time-how-investment-banking-interns-are-trying-to-impress-their-bosses-66037)
- long freaking hours 80-100hrs/week
- No life what so ever but a lot of money
- mundane work
- Loss in health?

Need I go on?

**Personal fit**

>If the mean income of a hedge fund trader is $650,000, then that’s
>$20m over a 30 year career. If you donated half, that would be enough
>to cover the salaries of about 5 non-profit CEOs or 2-3 academic
>researchers, while still having a huge amount left to live on. 

- Earning to give

  - Chances of clearing getting >730 in GMAT (70%)
  - Chances of clearing the scholarship criteria for RSM after
    getting 740 (60%) (same as in MC)
  - Chances of not burning out and quitting (10%)
  - getting a job in the top tier firm (50%)
  - Chances of staying for more than 5 years (10%)
  
  If in MC most people don't make partner and only 12.5% do, in IB I
  consider it to be even less.
  
  <!-- Maybe speaking to a few people might help .. Saw youtube video,
  fears are well founded. But need to check private equity and hedge
  funds and what those exit opportunities mean. Based on the footnotes
  I fuond online, they are expected to be equally fucked up.-->
  
  So a grand total of :0.2%
  
- Earning to give once we leave industry after 5 years

I don't see myself going on with IB, so for now I will assume the same
personal fit as in MC. 11%.

**Impact**

- Earning to give 

According to [80k-hours-trading](https://80000hours.org/2017/05/how-much-do-hedge-fund-traders-earn/), junior traders earn 300k - 3m per
year, this they reach within 8 years. More senior you get, the more
crazier it gets that Sr managers earn >10m$ "easily". Assuming average
earnings of 800k over 30 years, it appears that one can save **3771**
lives.

- Exit after 5 years to something else

In 5 years we can save about 100-150 people and then cash in on the
exit opportunities. Based on MC I guess the impact to be 700 lives. In
total 800ish.

- Using skills earned to move to EAOs

Not sure what skill applies here. I don't have the confidence in
selecting this career profile and hence am not spending much time in
evaluating this. I assume it might be the same as the impact for an
EAO,i.e,  970 lives.

**Personal Fit x Investment banking**

I am very afraid or completely not inclined to starting this career. I
maybe can work for 2-3 years. But If I am not working for more than
that then it seems like there is no point doing IB. IB is all about
money and putting in crazy hours all through your life at the cost of
sleep, health etc... I understand it has the maximum potential. I do
feel guilty that so many lives are at stake. But as 80k hours says,
personal fit is quite important. I strongly suspect I will burn out. I
am repelled by all the points mentioned in the supporting conditions
part of this profile. Instead if I did something else I could atleast
get a decent impact out there over a long term.

So I am almost confident that I am not going into the likes of IB, so
I don't see any point in evaluating this any further.

#### Programming, Machine learning PhD 

Apparently, learning to program could also be a gateway to DS,
Quantitative Finance, tech entrepreneurship, research and freelance
development. Useful in a multitude of industries, highly
transferable. But I am far from being a programmer. I still think DS
is the first place to start, as it allows me to immediately move to
the other industry and start gaining experience.
	
Also I am not sure how I will compete with all those programmers who
have been programming since they were kids. So I need time and a lot
of it. The same goes for Machine Learning PhD. So instead of staying
in DE I will go to DS, which already has some programming. I will pick
it up from there more about programming.

<!--  I think I need to understand what it means to programm. i.e, -->
<!--  what job I can do and what is the min. requirement to do that. -->

These could result in being the most fulfilling careers, but that is
not the only motive here. 

So for now I will start with 

But maybe then you decide to go into programming instead of DS..

<!-- need to check this out instead -->

#### Economics PhD

In this profile we are going to see about three types of paths:

- Taking academic jobs
- Taking non-academic jobs with a rare chance at making large
  impact
- Taking non-academic jobs for ETG

**Why Econ PhD**

>You gain a broad set of tools for understanding how the social world
>works, which is helpful for evaluating causes and interventions. This
>may help you better evaluate your future career options to have more
>impact. A notable example of this in action is the founding of
>GiveDirectly (one of GiveWell’s top recommended charities), which was
>founded by economics PhD students.

In addition we get adovocacy position

The ability to get a job is very high. Academic work seems to be very
important cause of its impact. 

>Economics professors get a lot freedom to do research across a wide
>range of topics and disciplines, which gives you great option value
>for future research.




**Skills**

- Excellent job prospects

Lowest unemployment rate amongst any science and engineering PhD's

- Can go into wide variety of jobs after PhD (highly transferable)
 
  Academia as well as jobs in policy, think tanks, NGO research, World
  banks, IB, Consulting
  
- Good safety net even if not in Academia

- This gets a 9/10.

**Connections**

Probably not much, but you get credentials which are very good which
can allow you to get connections. No during a PhD I suppose. This gets
a 6/10.

**Credentials**

>She explained that one of our main jobs as agency economists was to
>think about the big picture and be the voice of 'common sense' in the
>room. It is surprisingly difficult to find people who can do this,
>and the 'PhD Economist' credential is a signal that you might be the
>kind of person who can escape groupthink and see neglected but
>important side effects and chains of causality.- [noahpinion](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html)

A PhD in Economics by itself is a solid credential as people respect
what you should be capable of to do such a PhD. A PhD in economics,
gives you credentials for advocacy, in your job and blog life,[ as far
as I have seen.](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html) It can thus be argued that you have a very
important role in decision making as people value your insight into
matters. This puts the credentials as 8/10.

**Runway**

It is what comes with a DE. But it is worth to consider the money I
might have during an Econ PhD. The salary is around 15k$/year during
an Econ PhD. But with jobs I think I can easily make >100k $. So we
are at 5/10.

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

Very solid safety net, except for during the PhD where there is less
feedback and more anxiety. Either you become a tenure track academic,
or a non-tenure track academic or go to a job in policy or consulting
etc... The life of an Economics PhD can be intellectually satisfying.

The rating thus is 7/10.

**Personal fit** 

Assuming we want to be able to get into academic positions, we see
that the Top 10 universities are more respected with better placement
at tenure track and has [less variance in results](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NkhkJxVzqbTG1PZFNyMEN0bEU/view). Mentally
extrapolating to top 20 from [ what might be necessary to get into top
5](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/), it appears that top 20 might still be hard being from
"non-quants background". Even for non-academic jobs, it is easy to get
a job with a non-top 20 college, but the goal for us is to be the best
we can, and not just take have good odds of getting a non-academic
job. It appears to be important to atleast make it to the top 20
colleges, the probabilities for which are as shown:

- Chances of getting 165+ in GRE quants (90%)

	I love math. I already have experience with Linear Algebra, Calculus,
	ODE etc... It has all been part of my Gate training and I didn't shy
	from learning from very top Authors.

- Chances of learning Economics enough to get into top 20 within 2
  years? (70%)

	>An economics major isn’t required but you need proven math ability
	>and it helps to have taken mathematical economics classes.

	I don't know anything about economics and need to see how I fare by
	taking some courses. I can take some courses and see how I fare. I
	think I can do better in math with practice and I am sure it would be
	fun. Chances that I fare well (i.e., scoring>80/100) once I take a few
	econ courses I guess is 70%

- Chances of a getting an Econ Phd within top 20 (other factors) (70%)

	These factors would be things like, recommendation letters and
	statement of purpose working to my favor.

- prepared to work for long hours (95%)

	I have done it in the past. Currently, I clock about 11 hrs on 4
	weekdays per week, and still manage to go to the gym. 80k-hours says
	that I should be prepared to do 70+ hours a week (10 hrs a
	day), atleast during the first year of studies according to
	[econ-job-rumors-website](https://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/how-many-hours-do-you-work-at-various-phases-of-your-phd-studies/page/2). This is not a lot. And I don't see much
	panic around for the work after the PhD. So this is good.

- Research roles interest (80%)

	>Love intellectual pursuits and have a strong drive to do self-
	>directed research? 

	Can't say really. But I guess I would like intellectual
	pursuits. Self-directed research should not be a problem I think. I am
	here to create change. I would like the tools to do the research
	required. And the passion for doing anything seems to be contained in
	the equation of motivation. With good skills to understand how the
	social world works, I suspect I should be able to squeeze the
	necessary amount from the equation. Finishing the PhD badly or
	dropping out are still options to a future in MC or EAOs etc.. So not
	much to worry about.

So the chance of completing decently an Econ Phd within top 20 is:
33.5%

1. Jobs in Academia

	Jobs in Academia allow us to do research in high priority areas


	>the top 10 universities place nearly five times as many students
	>to tenure-track positions at top 20 universities as those ranked 11
	>through 20.- [Assessing placement economics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NkhkJxVzqbTG1PZFNyMEN0bEU/view)
	
	Tenure tracks are those in which a professor is given a permanent
    contract. He can then carry out the research that he wants. Tenure
    tracks are quite hard to get within the top 20 universities. But,

	>Both Miles and Noah have marveled at the number of smart people
	>working at non-top schools. That includes some well-known
	>bloggers, by the way—Tyler Cowen teaches at George Mason
	>University (ranked 64th), Mark Thoma teaches at the University of
	>Oregon (ranked 56th), and Scott Sumner teaches at Bentley, for
	>example. - [Qz complete guide to Econ PhD](https://qz.com/116081/the-complete-guide-to-getting-into-an-economics-phd-program/)
	
	It seems fine to work in non-top schools. 

	>People who feel that economics research incentives do not align
	>with trying to do research that is optimized for positive impact
	>may want to spend 7 to 11 years doing what it takes to get
	>tenure, and then work on whatever it is they want to work on. -
	>[Robin Hanson](https://80000hours.org/2013/10/the-value-of-economics-phds-a-conversation-with-robin-hanson/)
	
	A tenure track would give a lot of freedom. Ultimately we would
    want a tenure track and there is a high chance that we might have
    to work a few years before getting it.

	>Data indicates that more than half of the economics PhD’s get
	>jobs in academia after their PhD - [80k career guide](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/economics-phd/#advocacy-potential)
	
	Based on the above, it appears that there is a 10% chance to get
    tenure directly after the PhD. Once I am done with my PhD from the
    top 20, getting a job in academia is about 60-70%. Getting a
    tenure track after a few years of conventional work is estimated
    at 80%.	The total chances of getting a tenure track is thus:
		
		10% + 60%x80% = 58%
	
	So the total chance of pursuing a tenure track from now is 
	
		33% x 58% = 19%
	
2. Non-academia jobs with rare chance of saving >400 lives

	Success here is defined as getting into a government agency and
	getting the [rare chance](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) of making crazy impact (to be read as
	400 lives over a lifetime by a particular act) in addition to
	donations possible as a result of the job. Getting a government
	agency should be easier than pursuing a tenure track, which puts
	us at say roughly 60%. But being able to save an extra 400 lives
	[comes rarely.](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) I weigh this at 20%. Seems high based on what I
	have read, but still. So the total chance of pursuing an agency
	job with the rare chance is:
	
		33% x 60% x 20% = 4%

3. Non-academia jobs without rare chance

	>I completed my PhD in Econ (well Applied Econ) last year at an
	>unranked school, and had little trouble finding a good job. The
	>academic job market wasn't very receptive, but I received a fair
	>amount of interest from different businesses, and ended up in risk
	>management at a bank.

	>Most of my peers had similar success finding work. It seemed to me
	>that getting a tenure-track job from an unranked school is
	>difficult. But, getting a good, well paying non-academic job was
	>pretty easy. -[Noahpinion comments](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html)

	Chances of finding a job in general is high (85%). This puts us at a
	personal fit of 29%.

**Impact**
1. Impact of being in academia
	
    Looking at the career reviews by [80k-hours-guide](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/), we see that
    the impact by direct potential is rated as 3/5 where as for
    working at an EAO it is rated as 5/5. It has been estimated that
    the impact of working in an EAO is 970 lives. Extrapolating based
    on the rating this would put the impact of being in academia as
    ~582 lives.

2. Impact including the [rare chance](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) would be

	- impact of the rare chance 400 lives
	- impact due to advocacy 50 lives (pure guess) 
	- impact due to a jobs paying greater than median acdemic salary of
		108k Compounded at 4% with inflation of 2%, 20% donations and
		10% hike every 5 years (243 people)
	- Earning for a period of 30 years	
	- In total 750 lives

3. Impact not including the [rare chance](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) would be 

	- Value from taking up an MC job has effective impact is 670
      lives. This is for 40 years. The contribution extrapolated to 33 
	- impact due to advocacy 50 lives (pure guess)

Also exists an advocacy potential, through journalism, writing books
and influencing policy through your research.
<!-- what abou tan economics master? -->

I am not really going to nail this, as this is like an exit
opportunity and will be same as DS or MC I guess. If the main path is
not really that much worth, I would look at an MBA instead. And for
sure an Econ PhD would be much harder I think.

**Personal fit x Impact**

I think 80k hours vision is for people to take Econ PhD and either go
into academia with a tenure track or go into agencies or EAOs. 

- Econ PhD to tenure track

The decision tree is as follows:

Effective Value: 565 lives. 


With this career path we are interested in going to the tenure
track. But the Effective value is much more than the maximum impact
with the tenure track. This is because the '#lives if other is
significantly higher than what a tenure track can provide.

#### Working at an effective Altruism organization 

**Skills**

DS or research as an Analyst/content writer is as far as I see myself
going in. When I think of skills, I think of transferable
skills. Skills that will make me so valuable that I can transfer
ideally transfer from one profession to another.

The best skill is given by MC is the first assumption.

With such a research job, I am not sure where I can go next other than
within the EA community.Over the course of a few years, I rely heavily
on my connections to help me out for another job. Once I spent 6-7
years in it, what will I do next if it doens't work out? Rather than
that EA jobs seem to suck with transferable skills, unless in
management or administration is my guess. Research jobs where I
currently see my best fit involve lot of critical thinking etc... but
what type of jobs in the private sector can I go to afterwards, let
alone them paying a lot.

I suspect the job to be demanding and so I would say learning other
things on the side might be a little hard.

There is very litle on the job training, and lack of senior
mentorship. And the expertise is tied to the EA movement (unlike MC
for example).

>People sometimes worry that working at effective altruist
>organisations doesn’t lead to concrete foreseeable future career
>options. As we’ve argued above, you are likely to build skills and
>connections which mean you’ll have good opportunities in the
>future. However you might still feel uneasy not knowing what the
>future holds, even if on reflection you believe that you’ll have good
>future career options.

For the reasons stated above I give it a 6.5 to factor in some
uncertainty.

Yes it seems to be good with connections and credibility but not
really transferable skill. You can however work different roles or
mixed roles based on ones fit.

<!-- what about the other things you can learn? -->

**Connections**

There is little doubt regarding the connections I could make when I
want to be in the EA community [as exclaimed in this epic article by
80k ](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#how-good-is-the-career-capital) and [by the person who worked in GiveWell](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/). But my
connections seem to only belong here and around here. 

I think I am again saying that I can't hop between industries but only
within the EA movement. 

I am talking as though that is a bad thing. Well 80k exclaims, what if
EA grows down in popularity, I feel like I would be completely
abandoned. Where as if I did MC or DS I find my relavance in a wide
variety of places.

>If you think the EA community will keep growing, then the value of
>these connections just gets stronger over time.

But as I am looking for connections to improve my chances of success
in EA, I give it a solid 8.

**Credentials**

They are less prestigious than Google, Mckinsey or World bank, but
nevertheless some of the organizations have terrific credentials like
having gone through Y-combinator etc...

>Can get impressive achievements due to high levels of responsibility
> Some impressive affiliations (Y Combinator, Oxford, Good Ventures)
> Less brand recognition

Sounds like an 7. I don't think though that it beats DS cred. Atleast
there is some uncertainty.

**Runway**

I think I can transition to this job say by doing an internship at one
of the foundations. So this is could be sooner than I think. Of course
the current Runway of DE will make sense for it which would stand at
6.0. But also the earnings of EA work are very low and I am going to
say that with EA getting an 18 month runway would take even more
time. As they almost pay the lowest.

Without 18k in the bank don't go into this?

>As with other startups, there is a risk of your organisation running
>out of funding (though this hasn’t happened to any of the major
>organisations), or substantially changing its strategy, meaning you
>could lose your job.

**Personal Fit**

I think I am not yet a personal fit, but I can quickly get up to speed
with what they want and start working for them asap.

- Ability to gain Experience (80%)

> A track record of engaging with research in the community and making
> productive contributions to it.
  
  I don't know how I am supposed to get experience before working in
  an EA organization.
  
  But I can try doing other things, like starting an EA org in my city
  or working 80k or someone offline, producing some work for them and
  showing how much I am worth.
  
  I could also do an internship now or apply for it and plan for 2
  months next year if this is the highest impact career. i.e, do
  everything in my capability to get all the experience I need. 
  
  I mean what else is there to do in life.
  
- Relevant disciplines can be easily studied and skills built (85%)

>Having studied relevant disciplines at university, such as economics,
>statistics, philosophy or another quantitative field, helps, but
>isn’t necessary.

This I can compensate for by working on it by myself at home.

Personal fit involves how successful I will be if I pursue an EAO and
work with them and create the impact I need.

Seems like a very complex problem 

- Care about EA (90%)

> They really care about effective altruism, and are happy to talk
> about it all day.

What else is there to do in life?

- Can you manage your time and be efficient and self-directed? (85%)

With more responsibility I will thrive. I thrive in new situations and
learn quickly and literally anything. I have demonstrated this ability
at my current company and my internship atleast (based on the feedback
I have received.

I am always looking for hard problems to solve.

>They’re self-directed, able to manage their time well, they can
>create efficient and productive plans, and keep track of complex
>projects.

I think I would waste time, but with regular feedback I can
improve.

I have never really been on high alert except for during my work at
IIT or my entire masters. But then basically I worked all the time to
ensure success, as nothing was more important than this.

I am not sure how good I am, but I think I can manage a decent job and
will get better based on how important the job is to me I guess.

- Managing in case you loose your current job or the startup crashes
  (80%)

It is possible the EA movement as a whole loses it's momentum? If I
loose my job, atleast I am part of the community and would have built
some contacts.

If I loose my job right in the beginning, and can't find anything
tangible, then I can always go back to where I belong. If I loose my
job for whatever reason say after 5-10 years then it appears I should
have enough contacts to pull me through this.

i.e., Exit opportunities earlier are fine and later might revolve
around how I set it up with my connections.

But it is scary, say you have to move to the US, and then you find
that you loose your job, yes it is scary. But that is with any startup
and sometime you got to take your chances, with a good plan C

In total I would have 41.6%.

**Impact**

- Looking at number of lives due to this direct work

I assume working at an Effective EAO will allow me to save 970 lives
as detailed in the appendix. or more.

Also...

- Talent constrained vs funding constrained

Many organizations are talents

**Exit options**

>- Well positioned for senior positions in EA organizations

>- Connections in EA community allow exits into wide range of sectors

Perfect.

Main point with any career is build your connections and create value.

What about don't do direct work yet?

**Satisfying conditions**

I really hope. It's going to be EA 24*7? Let's see.

8.0 is the guess.       



#### Other interesting options
>Machine learning is a hot area a lot of people want to get into, so
there is a risk that it could become more difficult to get jobs as
lots of people crowd into the area. For example, MIT’s introduction to
machine learning course recently had 700 people sign up – they had to
use an overflow lecture room and deliberately weed people out of the
course early.18 If machine learning turns out to progress more slowly
than is expected, and doesn’t live up to the hype, then the number of
jobs might shrink as well.  Mixture of 2 industries

DS + DE

DS + finance

Programming + finance


#### Working @ effective non profits

Seems to be the same as working at an EAO, but more detailed. I will
skip it for now.

I remember reading in 80k-hours the importance of not working in an
NGO now but working on it later than now. First build CC and then come
back, as it is easier to go one way than the other.

**Skill building**

>For the most part, we discourage people from working at non-profits
>at the start of their career, because top private sector jobs, like

>connections and credentials that put you in a better position to make

>considering both, it can be better to work in the corporate sector
>first.

Training wise, advice wise it, considering working at both corporate
and non-profits would mean to gain work first at the corporate sector.

The goal right now is not to create the highest impact yet.. but to
make flexible career capital the most important thing in the world.

As per the frequent words from 80k-hours, working in an NGO should not
be the first thing to do for 2 reasons:

1. Experience is not really considered epic here

We rather learn much much more in the industry and then make the jump
to use our skills to make lives better.

2. Going to another job from here would be hard.

Going back to the industry would be hard. The skills that we gain in
the industry are much more valuable.

**Skills**

Transferable skills: for now its risky so 5

**Connections**

Yes in the field, but if shit goes wrong with the EA moment or that
there is a funding contraint as these are startups. It would be better
to rely on real world corporate experience first.

#### Founding a startup

There seems to be a lot of pointing towards learning to program and
learning the business. I guess that any skill you learn is useful nad
anything you are very good at will put you in a better place to
startup.

**Skills**

>Starting a tech company will force you to rapidly learn highly useful
>entrepreneurial and technical skills, meet lots of people, and it
>looks impressive (even if your business eventually fails, at least in
>failure-tolerant cultures such as the US and UK). Overall, we think
>it’s one of the best options for career capital.

For CC it appears to be really good, as we are usually all-rounders
while working for or co-founding a small startup.

While attempting to find a job once your startup tanks I am not sure
how good it is, but if you have the skills to start up and get a seed
accelerator, you must be having some skills. As pointed out by 80k in
the above quote, even if you fail, depending on the failure tolerant
cultures, you should be still able to pull it off get good career
capital.

It should atleast be an 8. Points are low due to uncertainty. 


**Connections**

You will probably meet a ton of people in the community, possibly some
influential people,depending on how good you are. If they will help me
to find opportunities and spread ideas later, it is not clear, but
likely based on how good they know you are.

Beware of [some horror stories and the connections as a result](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-startup-accelerator-and-incubator-horror-stories).

I will just assign it to be less than MC. This is primarily due to
uncertainity. (7)


**Credentials**

Having gone quite far with a startup might already serve as reasonable
credentials.

But doing this is quite hard. So I guess it at 6 points due to the
uncertainty.

**Runway**

Starting up takes time, before you get the minimum wage to live after
being accepted by an incubator, there is a lot of work to be done on
your own time. 

Current runway is important, and future runway to build will take a
long time.

Current runway depends on the job that I am doing currently and it
would take me 3 years of earning in DE to make that much of money. So
a 6.

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

I suspect there might be stress due to lack of funding, long hours are
there here, but I barely see myself complaining. There is a high
degree of autonomy and I have a personal stake in the situation. I
should definitely try it out with some decent skill or always be on
the lookout for some opportunities.

6.

I am not worried about it though!

**Personal**

> Highly unsure of average impact.

In order to estimate personal fit I will look at the chances. I assume
success to be able to get into Y-combinator and come out as a
successful business as:

- Chance of having the vision to be a Y-combinator level startup and
applying (5%)	

This seems like a lot especially considering my current level of
skills. But I do pick up things relatively fast, and can work long
hours. For now, lets just role with that number.

- chance of getting accepted in Y-combinator (2.5%)
- Chance of that startup succeeding (25% based on current
  [Ycombinator list](https://yclist.com/) of 11 years)
- = 0.03% (by multiplying everything)

**Impact**

I estimate the impact of starting up in tech to be
- Total donations per annum (60% of [2.5m$](https://80000hours.org/2014/05/how-much-do-y-combinator-founders-earn/#fn:5))
   - cost of one life (4k$)
   - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
   - Number of years of donation = 30
   - Increase in salary = 0% max per annum
   - Job change every 5 years with 0% increase
   - ~8k lives

**Personal fit x Impact**

I don't think this is for now. As I don't know where to start, and
what skills to leverage. Further more I am worried about the CC, in
case shit goes wrong. I think I generally suck at everything right
now. First goal would be to be really good at something and evaluate
my options from there on unless somehow I stumble upon something that
I can spin off. 

I can evaluate it when I have an opportunity. 

#### Startup employee

I guess I need to split it as an additional contribution.

We expect lower impact, risk and personal demands than a co-founder, 

>If you get the opportunity to join a startup that’s taking off, you
>may have greater earnings and impact by joining it than founding your
>own e.g. the 100th employee of Dropbox still made about $10m,
>equivalent to a 10% stake in a $100m company. -
>[Startup-employee-80000-hrs](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/startup-early-employee/)

The situation we envision and work out odds for is that, we join at
the beginning of a taking off startup and we are say 50-100 employees
into a big ass startup.

I keep the values for this quite rough. To me this appears as an
option in addition to something I choose. When I am at the position of
applying for jobs, that is when I should evaluate how important it is.

**Skills**

Depends on startup and the things you do, for example, DE, or DS or
management etc... Lets give it an 8, assuming that if you are one of
the first 50-100 employees you are probably given a lot of
responsibility and somehow the skills and knowledge become
transferable.

8.

**Connections**

Depending on the job and whom we have to interact with we might have
much larger set of connections.

Whether these connections will get you somewhere? depends and for the
uncertainty, it gets 6.

**Credentials**

It is very uncertain and depends on the field of choice. I say this
because the Credentials I have evaluated are different based on the
fields chosen.

Usually though if it is a high impact startup then you probably have
better credentials. I think this is tough to evaluate. I give it a
value of 7, sort of like an average of the fields I have seen until now.

**Runway**

Will be lower than a normal job in the beginning. 6.0 in the beginning
I guess.


**Personal fit**

As said earlier I will evaluate this further in the coming days when I
am in the lookout say for a job.

I am already working in a startup. When talking about how successful I
will be? 

Unfortunately the odds are that of how successful any startup would be
or how a startup would grow to be the next Airbnb etc... We will use
the same numbers as in `Founding a startup section`.

0.03%. The personal fit is ofcourse only for the extra contribution.

**Impact**

Impact in a startup is estimated at 8k lives. 

>Instead of receiving about 20% of the company’s equity, as a founder
>would, you’ll receive 0.1% – 1% depending on your role and how early
>you join, and you’ll receive more of your compensation as salary
>rather than equity. - [80k-hours startup employee](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/startup-early-employee/)

So the resulting impact is expected to be, lets say 0.5% of 8k = 40
in addition to the impact a normal engineer would have over his
lifetime, which is about 200-300 lives.

Of course there are other ways of increasing the number of lives
saved, but these could just well be our conservative estimates.

**Supporting conditions**

It cannot be as intense as it is for the co-founder. This is pretty
much the impression I get. Trainings and learnings from experienced
people might not really be present here. 

It would be a lot of responsibility. Might have good autonomy and
decent working hours. It will certainly fit with the rest of my life
relationships etc..

developer.

entrepreneurship, research and freelance work.

>Knowing programming is also helpful in many other industries and is
>likely to become more valuable in the future. 

Not much scope for other things besides programming such as
entrepreneurship or work with different organizations like in
consulting.

There is some scope for management level roles as you progress.

So skills are transferable and is usually a decent fit for earning to
give, not so much direct work unless you find something to do in your
freetime that somehow improves this.

7

**Connections**

Being at large companies gives possibility to make connections with
wealthy and influential people many of whom might want to do good.

6.5 due to the hype and factoring for uncertainity.

**Credentials**

Working at top-tier companies already gets you lot of prestige
apparently comparable to working in finance or consulting

Assuming getting into top companies is only a matter of effort, I give
it a close 7.5 as compared to MC.

**runway**

>Software engineering is a moderately well-paid career. Average US

Even at google the estimated salary is 300k at max.

US seems to be the place to be and further more silicon valley and
possibly after a killer bootcamp.

Runway for now is still with DE. Once I get a job in real programming
an earn decently ofsourse, it should not be a problem.

But I need time and so the thing of DE applies.

**Personal fit**

The impression I get based on [80k hrs profile on SE](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/software-engineering/) is that:
- humanities and science people have done it by their own
- need to demonstrate strong interest in programming

<!-- talk to suruta mudi to get some ideas -->

But it doesn't seem to be building skills for direct working I
think. Especially that of an analyst, or an organization person. I
could be a web developer and develop apps for them though, but I don't
at this moment see this taking off in that direction.

It comes with decent exit opportunities, but when will I move to it ?

- Chance of getting into software company (within 1-2 years) (90%)
- Chance of learning the skills of being google worthy in Europe (85%)
- Chance of getting into top tech companies in Europe in 5 years
  (other factors) (80%)
  
Working in NL: 

All of the above

Working in US:

Factor in L1/other ways:

65%; More than that considered earlier, because we are in software

**Impact**

Assuming I start with a salary of 120 k at google in the next 5 years.
- with an increase in salary of 4%
- inflation of 2%
- every 5 year increase of 10%

Can save about ~400 people. In addition I could work on some advocacy,
and direct work due to the available time. I will just estimate that
at say another 20 lives (wild ass guess)

There is possibility to do more, by working remotely say from
Thailand. Working lesser hours on work and on other side projects.

###  calculations
##### Calculating impact of direct working in 80k-hours

**Problem**

80k-hours has changed the lives of 1k people over 8 years. Per change
the cost is about 1337$. We seek to estimate the contribution of an
analyst in case he joins 80k-hours.

**Assumptions or guesses** 

80k is a reputed NGO, that is committed to creating massive impact. It
is one such organization which I would want to join with the hopes of
creating large impact.

They are about 15 people excluding advisors, 2 co-founders, 6 core
members, 3 freelancers and 4 operations people. 

My contribution would be 1.8% of the whole company, in the first year
assuming my contribution is [10%](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) of the co-founder, and the core
team and management team at 30% and 10% each respectively.

<!-- **Other factors** -->
<!-- - contribution of the donors -->
<!-- - Contribution of the analyst assuming he is replaceable -->

**Factors:**

- contribution of 80k to the total lives saved by the changed lives
  (based on 80k's plan) (20%) (guess based on one of the profiles)
- contribution of 80k with the donors money (40%)(based on [GiveWell
  estimate](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/))
- contribution from the analyst when he is replaceable (10%) (
  [GiveWell estimate](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/))
- Contribution to the analyst is 1.18% of the whole company (as in
  assumptions and guesses)
- The minimum number of lives saved by anyone whose plans have been
  changed is assumed to be what I can contribute at my easiest. i.e.,
  working at DE for the rest of my life and donating 15%. Easy. Comes
  to about 222 lives. (derived above)
  
  Although I think 10% is a fair number to assume for donations, I
  suspect that with the change in plan based on 80k-hours
  intervention, the impact could be atleast 1.5 times than what I
  could have done without 80k-hours.
  
- Number of plans changed in a year = 457 on average and is growing
(last 2 years plans changed was >1k)

**The calculation**

- Number of lives saved would thus be: 457*222 lives per year

- Number of lives saved by an analyst per year = Multiplying by all
  factors with the number of lives saved in total per year= 10 lives
  
- If this grows compounded at 2% with 1% inflation in costs and a 10%
  hike every 5 years for the next 40 years, we get **626 lives**.
  
**Reflection on the calculation**

- I feel like I have been heavily hoping for this answer to turn out
  ridiculously large say in k's of people saved. But its only 2-3x more
  than what I could save just being a design engineer. I want to say
  JUST 2x more, but I will wash my mouth. 
  
  >Stanford economists have demonstrated that the average value of a
  >year of quality human life is actually closer to about $129,000.
  
  I am very STUPID. It is not the difference between 200 and 600 rs my
  dear motherfucker, it is the goddamn difference between 25 million
  to 75 million $ in value, and that too just for one year.  (My
  internal bells just went off!  essay writing you rock)
  
  Looking at this, even if I spend 4k on a saving a fucking life,
  imagine the value I create. It is very easy to fall for shit due to
  my scope insensitivity, but pandians are awake and kicking now. 
  
  Even if we assume the value to the cost of saving a life alone,
  right now. To save 200 lives and to save 600 lives is the goddamn
  difference between saving 800k$ and 2.4mill$ over a life time. It
  might not do a lot inside, but mind you, you are scope
  insensitive. Shut up and multiply has never been so resounding
  inside my head this much. A year later it starts to make sense.
  
- The numbers produced here seem conservative and very rough, with
  the estimates of my contribution as well as the number of
  plans changed (as we take average and not the current)
  
  Changing the numbers a bit, and making it less conservative, I
  stumble upon another rough estimate of about 2777 lives per
  lifetime per person.
  
  So I would say there is a possibility of saving 600 to 3000 lives
  over the next 40 years for me while doing direct work.
  
- Another estimate of value created by working [@ GiveWell is
  $97,900](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) which translates to about 1500 lives roughly over 40
  years (compounded at 2% with 1% inflation in costs and a 10%
  interest every 5 years)
  
- I guess it is more about the ball park or the relatively larger good
  you can do by working in EAO's such as GiveWell.
  
- Recently I came across an argument regarding ["Why I am not
  replaceable"](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#why-is-working-at-an-ea-organisation-high-impact), by 80k hrs. And it argued that if I take
  up job at an EAO, then I free up the other person who is "supposed
  to replace me" to do other good things. 
  
  Also most organizations are talent constrained rather than funding
  constrained, adding more points to the above argument regarding
  replaceability.
  
  And in that case the GiveWell estimate would go from 97k to 970k/
  year.
  
  But, 
  
  >To get a sense of how much value you create by working at an EA
  >organisation, we asked the organisations how much funding they
  >would have traded for their most recent hire. They gave an average
  >of $126,000 – $505,000 and a median of $77,000 – $307,000 per
  >year.
  
  It appears that assuming yourself as not completely replaceable as
  well as assuming yourself completely replaceable might not be a good
  estimate. We will fall in between and based on the expected value an
  EAO thinks of us, it appears that the 97k is indeed a nice
  conservative number and we will stick with the impact calculated as
  a result which is 970 lives over 40 years. 
  
  Another thing is that the whole [Indirect
effects](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) is not taken into account at all.

##### Calculating the impact of working in design engineering

I estimate the impact of being an engineer as
 - Total donations per annum (20% of 46k$)
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 40
 - Increase in salary = 4% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 10% increase
 - 20% donation per year
 - = <200
 
 
I estimate the impact of starting up in tech to be
 - Total donations per annum (60% of [2.5m$](https://80000hours.org/2014/05/how-much-do-y-combinator-founders-earn/#fn:5))
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 40
 - Increase in salary = 5% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 12.5% increase
 - ~38k lives
 
## Analysis
  * [x] Fix the bug of impact of Top NGO's

        section

        and inform the findings.
		
I have now two sets of data one that I made including my personal fit,
all based on articles mostly from 80k. The other being the set of data
from[ 80k's career reviews](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) summary with their own evaluation of the
numbers.

**Why didn't I use the numbers from 80k directly**

For me I wanted to compare impact across all types of saving
lives. Plus I made some subdivisions of each profession trying to
gauge how useful it would be if I went in one direction instead of the
other within the same career. For example, MC as ETG or MC followed by
DW. I could have probably extrapolated from 80k numbers now in
hindsight. 

I guess I still could.

**Performing the sanity check:**

For Career Capital: The ranking goes as 

| rank | My result     | rank 80k |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 1    | MC            | 1        |
| 2    | Econ PhD      | 2        |
| 3    | IB            | 3        |
| 4    | DS            | 2        |
| 5    | Working @ NGO | 2        |
| 6    | Starting up   | 2        |
| 7    | DE            | -        |

80k-hours evaluates DS better than IB in CC. But if you can go from IB
to MC, PE, hedge funds and other exit opportunities, I don't see why
it is bad in CC. IB on the resume seems to sound fancier than DS.

But this is not the deal breaker.  I don't see the need to make it
more accurate as personal fit will be the deal breaker anyways.

For Impact:

I compute total impact to the extent possible by translating
everything into equivalent money possibly generated and then translate
it to lives by dividing it with 4000 $(The cost of a life according to
AMF).

With 80k-hours these are just points to individual impact. So I don't
know if we can directly compare direct earning and direct impact. In
other words, is the 5 star rating in direct impact and a 5 start
rating in Earning and that of the career capital equal to each other.

Adding them directly I compare the result:

| rank | Work                            | rank (80k) |
|------|---------------------------------|------------|
| 1    | Starting up                     | 1          |
| 2    | IB(ETG)                         | 3          |
| 3    | MC(as a partner)                | 3          |
| 4    | Direct working @ EAO (DS etc..) | 1          |
| 5    | Econ PhD. with rare chance      | 6          |
| 6    | MC (exit after 5 year)          | -          |
| 7    | DS/SE in the US                 | 5          |
| 8    | DE in the US                    | -          |
| 9    | DS in Europe                    | -          |
| 10   | DE in Europe                    | -          |

I find my estimates to be reasonable.

- Based on mainly 80k text I generate these values as much as I can
assuming every 4k$ saves 1 life.

- I am not sure if the 80k scale is made to be directly added.

- I have attempted to consider a type of career within a career
  category. For example, within MC I look at MC primarily for direct
  giving and MC for earning. This is generally not done by 80k-hours.
  
  I think what 80k hrs might have with their scaling is that they show
  the maximum capabilities in direct working and earning or
  advocacy. Unlike what I have done, as a person can probably pursue
  one activity primarily and not all of them simultaneously.

With this I conclude the section on impact, reasonable as well.

Supporting conditions/ Job satisfaction:

| 1    | DE        |

| 2    | Startup   |
| 5    | MC        |
| 5    | Econ PhD  |
| 6    | IB        |

No supportive conditions details given in the 80k directory. But it
can be derived based on their career profiles.

But I don't care about it too much except for working crazy hours like
in IB, or that I have to uselessly sit in an office and do mundane
work.

### Question to Ram

1. Can I multiply prolties? Is there a better way to do this while
   comparing different options

So I am attempting to estimate which career is my best fit. In order
to do that I look at the chances of an event A, B to G. I multiply all
of these chances to get my personal fit.

The problem is though, with every career, my events are quite
different and the number of events also are different.

Also, the more number of events I have my personal fit automatically
goes down big time. 80% probabilities in 2 events will give me a very
bad personal fit of 64%.

Can you comment on if this is the way of the world or can I do better?

2. What is the best way to estimate lifetime salary.

My typical approach is assume a salary growth of 4% an inflation of 2%
and 10% increase every 5 years and take it all the way till I am 70.

By doing this my estimate really large salaries when I am say 70. I am
afraid it is realistic. So for example, my current salary is 40k/year,
I claim it to become 362k/year when I am 70.

Sometimes I really know what the salary is going to be at a certain
level and then I use that directly, say in the case of Management
Consulting.

Is there a better approach? Your thoughts on what I can do better and
what I am doing wrong.

It appears that **DS for direct giving** would be the best to choose,
looking at CC, impact and Personal fit together.

  * [ ] One thing I want to check is how CC and Impact are compared to

An Econ Phd would be the next best thing, if we don't really try to
1work in the government and look out for that rare chance as an
analyst.

It is very suprising that DS for ETG at NL is the third option,
followed by DE for earning to give.

The personal fit plays a mightly role in all of this I guess.

I am early in my career (27) and would like to place more weight on
flexible CC.

1. IT of EAO = CC of MC ; Everything from there could just be a linear
extrapolation.

Seems to be a reasonable estimate I think. I do not want to match it
to the IT of IB as it then makes IT of EAO look really low (looking at
it linearly). Which seems to not be the case.

80k gives Direct impact capabilities a max rating when one works in an
EAO. 

Also there could be other career profiles that could have much larger
impact say 100k lives. If I take them to be the gold standard then
everything else will have a small number compared to CC. 

I think what I am doing here is compare achievable CC to Achievable
impact. This sounds reasonable?

Well! 

Atleast it seems to not make sense to compare to a president. 

Is it possible to somehow estimate the impact worth of CC and equate
it to EAO.

In my head I have already made the decision that IT of EAO = CC of
MC. I am only trying to prove it right I think. 

I shall comeback to this later I guess. for now, this seems fine.

2. Rate max best CC as 10 and best IT as 10.

But the problem is that impact is like very non linear. There is
impact of 400 and there is like 10 times its impact.

Say I know something that can save 8k lives and then something that
can save 400 lives. 8 lives can be 10 and 400 lives can be 0.5. But
then in CC, IB could have a max 10 and DE could have a 5 already. If
we add it up directly then the contribution of impact is so low for
DE. What does this mean? I 

I am afraid it is not weighed properly

Define properly. If there is an accepted number of CC which can
correlate with Impact. Maybe even then we have lot of problems. 

  * [ ] I feel too confused. I would like to get the data out
again. Look at 3-4 cases only and decide how I am going to compare and
weight the different alternatives.

  * [ ] look at the 80k guide
  
  or just keep it as it is and go forward. Don't do the adding?


Skip this. Don't need to add and compare. Seems pointless when I have
no idea what it means. It seems like just a ranking.

### Looking at the ranking

The second best option seems to be DS in NL as ETG. Shocked! I guess
it is because of the ridiculous personal fit that this has happened.
IB is out of the question. I am really afraid of burning out, the way
of work is quite unhealthy and I need to take care of myself for
serving mankind on the long run.

**CC**
MC seems promising CCwise. But say I find out I am not partner
material or I didn't get a scholarship or the hours are sick, then ETG
is not really an option, so I have to move out. When I move out yes I
can do other things, join a company bla bla and rise the ranks. What I
am uncertain about this is being able to work in an EAO. 

MC is my decentest chance of maximizing ETG. And it is not really out
of my scope I think, although my personal fit might say otherwise. The
personal fit factors in a ton of uncertainity and path that I have
chosen i.e., an MBA without scholarship sounds unimaginable. In case
it is not the cut for me, then with the GREATEST CC (5 stars on 80k) I
should be able to pick up my shit and do other things. But, the other
best way to create impact is by working at an EAO. *My uncertainity is
whether I am allowed to work at an EAO*.

<!-- MC in EAO OK/NOK: mail rob now -->

Given 6 months more, my personal fit estimate would have improved
because, that is how long I plan to take to prepare for GMAT and give
a score. By then I can make a better decision to move out to DS byt
year 28- whats in another few months. It seems like I should be able
to pick up DS with a delay of 6 months. I don't see it as a problem.

I assume the impact due to an MBA not in any of the top 3 or without
a scholarship as shit. I don't consider the career.

maybe... <!-- try to evaluate a MC without scholarship and  -->

**Impact based**

I don't think I can already start working in an EAO as I might need
some special skills, or do other things to get attention of people in
the community before I apply for a job, but never the less, based on

>Earlier we saw the example of Kate, who went to work at a
>non-profit. Not only do non-profit jobs often build your skills more
>slowly, they’re also less flexible. It’s widely accepted in the
>non-profit sector that it’s easier to switch from a business job to a
>non-profit job than vice versa. So if you’re unsure between the two,
>a business position offers more flexibility.

**Best choice overall**

DS in the beginning and moving to opportunities in DW seems to be the
best option with decent CC ([4/5](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) according to 80k) and decent
possibilities to DW ([3/5](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) according to 80k). However, because of
the skills, I see decent chances of moving to an EAO in some
years. There by gaining sufficient flexible CC and capabilities and
credentials to move to be worthy of a top EAO. 

By this I mean for the next 5 years, I will work my ass off and
understand and build my skills in programming and statistics and
writing. This will allow me to improve my scene in the 80k community
and join as an analyst, or writer, researcher based on DATA. Critical
thinking is the main think, solving problems is the other part of it. 

At this point I say, why won't I be offered a job in EAO, taking into
account why I am doing what I doing.

#### Elimination of the obvious

I have the numbers that I need and can already make a decision. Just
choose the highest number and I should be good right? Well there is
uncertainity in the numbers and I want to take it slow and start by
first removing the obvious ones based on reasoning and looking at the
numbers.

**CC wise**

DE for DW is a no go, has the lowest cc rating. One can argue that
once you get into and EAO, you will do great things and with the time
that DE in NL offers I can pretty much build whatever skill I want.

The point is the EAO's primarily require organizational capabilities,
research capabilities, writing capabilities, DS, programming, as far
as I know. But DE seems to offer none of this. Staying in DE and
becoming great at it and moving to a start up can be an option, but we
know how low probability that is.

<!-- What do EAO's actually require skills wise -->

So over all, for the above reasons it seems like a weak choice, but an
obvious other option is to do DS instead and it seems to beat the DE
for DW instantly as it gives you several opportunities to become
capable for EAO, wiht programming and statistics info. Everything
thing that you do at work, is counting towards the 10k-hours-rule
unlike in DE where the work at an EAO is almost orthogonal.

**Support conditions wise**

SC wise it appears that IB is a sure reject. I am really afraid of the
long hours and the tales of horror, lack of excitement in job. Which
is why I think it is a poor fit SC wise even for me. SC, I
gather/understand/guess that it is better even with MC. With hours
being reasonable.

**Impact**

I think it is fair to eliminate Econ Phd with rare chance. Based on my
calculation the number of lives saved isn't as much as working in MC
for 5 years and then leaving

**Total wise**

An Econ Phd can contribute moderately towards impact using ETG and
Advocacy. But, the one that has most impact is when an Econ Phd can
just save too many lives by being at the right place and at the right
moment. The thing is people look at Econ people with respect regarding
things they say, and this makes them very valuable in the field of
policy. 

An Econ PhD however with such a chance of getting this opportunity of
potentially adding benefits to a few millions of lives seems mighty
low as factored in the profile on Econ PhD. To add further, the
estimated impact was calculated to be lesser than EAO impact. Based on
my source who is an Econ PhD from the top 5 universities and got a job
in the government, I think it is wise to let this rare chance in
combination with an Econ PhD slide. 

Despite with the scope of causing maximum impact ever, the chances of
succeeding are really really low for now. 

However, in the later stages of my life working for a startup or
co-founding a startup should definitely be considered, considering the
impact. With a year or 2 of effort, we can better estimate the success
of the startup (say you get accepted into Ycombinator). Even to
attempt startups I need some proper CC, having worked a few years,
which I can use to add value.

<!-- I am afraid that I give more probability to something that is far
--> <!-- away, I seem to be more optimistic about scenario that is -->
<!-- more far away-->

As a sanity check, all the ones eliminated until now, seem to be on
the bottom of the list, when organized based on the total awarded to
each independent career path.

#### Comparing EAO vs DS

Comparing working now at an EAO and taking up DS now, I interpret the
advice from 80k as 'take up DS now'.

> If you are still early in your career, then it’s best to place greater
> importance on career capital than on role impact, as you’re likely to
> be able to find plenty of good opportunities to invest in yourself. If
> you’re late in your career, place less importance on career capital
> and more on making an impact now. That said, the amount of weight to
> put on career capital can also depend on which problems you want to
> work on. See more. 

I anyways need skills, which I need to spend time on. By the looks of
it, statistics, organizational etc... Maybe it may workout that after
one year I should move to EAO. But for now, I don't think EAO is the
right place for me yet.

The CC at an EAO is not really great with respect to getting training
or assistance from experienced people. The DS track followed by
working at an EAO at some point in life seems better than the EAO
track right away based on the advice of 80k-hours.

#### Comparing Econ Phd without the rare chance vs DS

An Econ Phd although hyped greatly by 80k-hours due to its advocacy
potential and possible impact and CC, it still seems to be a not so
great fit. Impact wise I claim an Econ Phd without the rare chance can
save 550 lives @ 29% personal fit. Where as a job at an EAO can save
>970 lives @ 41% personal fit.

It appears that EAO is the place to be and not an Econ PhD. As seen
above though, we want to start with something else (say DS) before we
move to an EAO. By extension then 'DS for DW' beats Econ PhD. 

#### DS vs MC (becoming partner)

MC along with becoming a partner is an incredible opportunity for
ETG. However the personal fit of 1.3% is really low for something with
a potential to save >1200 lives over ones life time. It appears that
it would be better to bet on EAO instead. As the >1200 lives is
dependent on several stages of the career over the next 25 years. It's
not like you can work it out a little and figure out much better
estimates of the personal fit. A personal fit of of 57% is required
for it to match the 'total' of a job at an EAO. With 1 years effort I
can know if I got scholarship in top 20. I would still be at a
personal fit of 25% and far from competing with 'working at an EAO'.

Although an MC is great in CC, I am not sure how it translates when I
would like to work for an EAO. In any case based on the personal fit
(i.e., probability of success) a DS would still beat an MC as the
number of lives saved has been assumed to be the same when working at
an EAO. 

At this moment it appears that MC of any form is not favourable even
with a few years of going further with the career due to the large
uncertainity and seemingly better option of 'DS for DW'. And as said
earlier, even if I spent time to see how far I get with 

So becoming partner is far fetched. Even if I went as far as finishing
my MBA successfully, my other options now are to work for some
organization (with an impact of 700 lives) or join an EAO (with an
impact of >970 lives). I am not sure why I would go with any of these
two options as DS with an EAO track seems more possible with similar
impact levels. 

There by it appears that MC is not worth pursuing just for the CC
alone, as impact estimated along with the personal fit, can be
obtained by other means with much more confidence.

#### Eliminating 

Having eliminated Starting up, Econ Phd with rare chance and IB, I see
that MC all variations of an MC career at low in the table.

This I think is mainly due to the personal fit. For example, becoming
a partner at a top agency is going to be really hard, even for the top
brains, and I estimated that probability to be 1%. Even if you save
1000 lives, it is still not the right move for you, as the net result
is looked at `0.01x1000=10 lives`

Getting an MC is so hard already that the even if there are back up
options, the personal fit is still low. This does not make any more
sense and hence until the personal fit is revised this does not seem
to make sense. 

Also, 



### Questions to Ram

1. Can I multiply prolties? Is there a better way to do this while
   comparing different options

So I am attempting to estimate which career is my best fit. In order
to do that I look at the chances of an event A, B to G. I multiply all
of these chances to get my personal fit.

The problem is though, with every career, my events are quite
different and the number of events also are different.

Also, the more number of events I have my personal fit automatically
goes down big time. 80% probabilities in 2 events will give me a very
bad personal fit of 64%.

Can you comment on if this is the way of the world or can I do better?

**Answer**
Ram suggests to use atleast the same number of events for each case.

2. What is the best way to estimate lifetime salary.

My typical approach is assume a salary growth of 4% an inflation of 2%
and 10% increase every 5 years and take it all the way till I am 70.

By doing this my estimate really large salaries when I am say 70. I am
afraid it is realistic. So for example, my current salary is 40k/year,
I claim it to become 362k/year when I am 70.

Sometimes I really know what the salary is going to be at a certain
level and then I use that directly, say in the case of Management
Consulting.

Is there a better approach? Your thoughts on what I can do better and
what I am doing wrong.

**Answer:**
Above 45 the rise in salary cannot be as much as 4%. 

3. While evaluating careers. 

lets take MBA track with becoming partner, leaving Mc after 5 years or
do something else.

While estimating the P of each of this, the P of MBA multiplies.

I look at it like independent tracks, but in reality they are backup
options, which I will take up based on how they pan out.

How can I caliculate resulting number of balls I can buy?

**Answer**

P(partner)*impact of partner+P(mc)*feefles;

This might actually change some results and the contribution or the
total lives it can save Huh?


## Reflection

Work at a growing organization

Pursue certain graduate studies

Develop valuable transferable skill

Do what contributes to build career capital


Blockchain

- Summary of the whole thing.
- compare main careers
- Look at things like startup to aid or increase CC in tech only
- There seems to be a possibility of being more than one.

#### IB

[Rubin and Archer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ibMt0kQiw)were analysts quit IB for the following reasons:

- Despite putting 80-100 hrs/ week they still had to kiss ass,
  sometimes it doesn't make 
  
- Exit options are good apparently

- Mundane, not really, mainly ppts.

- Work goes unnoticed if kissing ass is not done 

- pretend to do work, when there is no work

- Very competitive

- Can learn the finance skills in 6 months.

- analyst to associate almost needs in MBA go in private equity and
  hedge funds (500k$)
  
- MBA for higher ups anyway most people.

- The skills you learn in IB can be got within 6 months (finanacial modelling), you don't
  really need to spend years working here to gain the skills
  
- Pure skills might be more freaking valuable or business skills that
  will allow you to scale a company from the ground up
 
- POlitics Bonus... 

- Pretend to do work... 

- Whether they like you are not. Unhealthy!

- They might not use your work everything you sacrificed. 

- He missed his cousins wedding and they still took the name out of
the book he made.

- If you focus on Statups and gaining crazy skill, then you will get
equity. and a fulfilling career. Stick to this part of the game.

----- 

What is IB?

Supporting companies that do mergers. Nothing sexy. As analysts
support the bbuying selling of companies, raising capital etc...

What do they do Day to Day?

There is an organizational schematic. The associate will drop at 7pm
in the evening a task of making 100 pages of document within the next
morning with good graphs and stuff that the higher ups can deal with.

Do market research, projections on excel what the company can
	buy... they present the ppt and engage as advisor. 1-2 months
	
Is IB fun?

Everybody is super excited. 100 hrs a week, not working on models
every week, lot of politics, youre even changing font colors on
things.

Lot of analysts use IB as a stepping stone finance and the corporate
world... exit opportunities. Hedge funds and private equity after 3
years. I am not sure I am 

21 years-  80-90k base ...signing bonus 10k ... bonus at the end of
the year...  75% to 100% of annual salary. 150 to 200 k ... By the 3rd
year you could make 250k . 150k easily @ 22 years. 100 hrs a week.


Exit opportunities: 

looks good on the resume.... good for MBA to exit to


Avg day: 8 to 9 am start.. 3-4 deals... need ppt by 3pm.. do
stuff... models draft by 2pm... follow up work for to other
things...until 7 pm. 

After that... you sometimes have to work until 2am and even drop off
the stuff at your MD's house. if you go to sleep at 6 am you are still
expected to come back to work at 10am. (get out of here)

Doesn't happen everyday, but it does happen. NO Weekends

168 hrs - 100 hrs work -40 hrs sleep = 28 hrs!

They have breaking into startups.

## Who earns the most

People in management law or Finance


## Consultant

X-BCG employee is glamourous?



## MBA

There are couple of things one can do after an MBA, such as management
consulting, Investment Banking Private Equity, Hedge Funds, Trading. 

I barely have a clue of what each of this is. 

In [this post](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/152549/working-for-mckinsey-bain-and-boston-consulting-vs-goldman-jpm-and-morgan-stanley) the difference between an IB'er and an MC't is
seen. 

> Investment banking (IB) denotes a financial service that creates
> capital for individuals and organizations, according to one
> definition. Investment bankers (i-bankers, or just “bankers”) give
> investors counsel on market strategies that can minimize their risks
> and maximize their returns. They provide assistance for mergers,

>A management consultant (MC) provides expert advice to businesses on

>to create strategies to help companies make a turnaround. They look
>at what their client companies have been doing and suggest what they
>can do to perform better. MCs deal with different types of problems

>how to improve its product delivery or advise HR people how to create
>a new health plan for employees.-[MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/)

It is clear from the above that one majors in Finance and the other
just in about anything to help a company get back or improve. MC's are
generally generalists, but somehow in the end are working for a
particular type of industry. 

Job satisfaction is expected to be better in MC than in IB, and the
hours are not that bad as in IB. Sometimes we work weekends, sometimes
not. IB in addition to all this shit, needs Facetime and 

Pay in MC is about 30-50% of an IB'er.

Pay in MC is detailed [here](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/nl-en/246284/work-in-management-consulting-how-much-you-will-make-at-mckinsey-bcg-and-bain). It appears that at Mckinsey one
earned in the year of 2017 an average salary of 140k. Which basically
a high performing engineer in apple can doing DS. [80k says a similar
salary for an associate as well (80 to 170k)](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/)

**PE** is usually seen as an exit opportunity for IB. I googled what
it is and found some finance jargon and I leave it at that. PE can be
as bad as IB in terms of hours clocked or not depending on somethings,
but the pay gets even higher than in IB is my understanding according
to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ibMt0kQiw). People usually work for a few years in IB and then
move on to PE. PE apparently has more interesting work. Hours are
better when deals are not being made. But if in the middle of the deal
16 hours. But PE hours for juniors might still be punishingly
hard. Pay is same apparently according to [this source](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/nl-en/178146/honest-account-working-promised-land-private-equity), but
somehow the environment is better and chances of a burn out are
less. The hours still look bad according to this [quora post](https://www.quora.com/Whats-it-like-to-work-in-private-equity).

**Hedge funds**

 So you start at a company
and based on the amount of success you add, you get a corresponding
compensation. So in the beginning years it is not really high as you
need time to learn the tricks of the game. 

>We found that junior traders typically earn $300k – $3m per year, and
>it’s possible to reach these roles in 4 – 8 years. Senior portfolio
>managers can easily earn over $10m per year,-[80khours-hedgefunds](https://80000hours.org/2017/05/how-much-do-hedge-fund-traders-earn/)

- Money is crazy. 
- Hours are not as bad as in IB (50-60hrs). Apparently as the job
  revolves around capital markets and market closes.

As pleasant as that may sound, a brief view of what happens as [shown
here](http://www.lifeonthebuyside.com/buy-side-analyst-good-bad-day/) wants you to get away from this as well. I cannot deal with
these things knowingly that they will happen some time. I am not cut
out for this, I think. I have hated it always and I would liek to add
value in a different way.

In all of these programs it is to be understood that there is crazy
competition and you need to be the best of the best. Also there is the
possibility of market crashing affecting you. With all the stress I
doubt I will be able to eat sometimes, or go to the gym even.

#### chances hedge fund
Earnings need to be corrected for chances of leaving a job to more
operational roles, future prospects of industry and personal fit.

## Economics Phd

Non quantitative background would need additional training. Being a
ME, I am not sure what I need.

165+ in GRE is definitely achievable with some training. 


### Personal fit

I don't know how much of a fit it is. So I am trying to estimate my
fit..

In [here (80k non-quants bc help)](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/) I find that it is rather hard to
get an Economics PhD, if we haven't done MATH or ECONOMICS. Atlest
that the switch wont be straightforward. 

Although I am in Engineering, the switch we are looking according to
the link above seems to be 1-3 years, i.e, doing a transition course
and then a masters and gathering up some decent references and then
trying to get a PhD.

I think it makes sense to consider what happened. It appears that
University of Florida (UF) is ranked 105 in 2015, the year I had
joined and TU delft is ranked 17 for mechanical engineering according
to [here](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2015/engineering-mechanical). Checking on another site informs me that TU delft is
fucking ranked 18. Get out of here!

That is going for me to say that I have actually been studying here
instead of in the US. 

The credentials that got me here in Mehanical engineering

Although I do see really fucking stupid people overall in TUDELFt,
unfortunately even in material science. People who are so stupider
than me. Who basically studied shit in their bachelors and yet got
admitted to rank 18 university. 

To further comment about TU delft. I see that, even in my batch, there
were some really intelligent people or rather, people who have done
some realted work on a subject before, but I could match their
intelligence by putting in more hours than they did with their social
life. 

The master that I joined also had one really dumb person, who somehow
managed to finish it. My problem is TU Delft although a credential
doens't reflect my capability. Although, I would say I will be inthe
80% of my class. mostly. I am not very dumb or anything, and towards
the 2nd year, I also earned quite some >9s in my subjects in subjects
that had a lot of math involved, also dynamics and the like. This I
can highlight for the team.

Coming back I cannot claim crazy references to get an eco phd. I
suspect I have better references now, example, Rixen, Matthijs from TU
Munich and Tu delft, and maybe Sandipan or Palram from IIT. Mostly I
should just do some economics course and score highly there say even
on course era or something. I need to get evaluated how good I could
be to get an Eco Phd from then on.

I think speaking to an Eco Phd guy or looking at the two guides I have
in front of me, shed more light.

But according to [ here (person from non-quants background)](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/), 

>The most straightforward route is to do either the one year economics

>diploma at the beginning). These courses are designed for people who
>have done other subjects for undergrad, and if you do well in the
>first year you can progress on to do a masters. If you perform highly
>in the masters program, and line up some good references, you stand a
>shot at getting into a US PhD program at the end (and an even better
>shot of getting into an UK PhD).

Sounds like a 60% chance at best.

a) I don't have the money now to do a diploma 
b) If even then you "only have a shot", its not that good of a bet to
be placed.

Apparently a lot of harvard graduates have done a masters and then a
year of work in research to obtain a stellar reference, that gets them
some place good. 

[Certainity of finding soe job exists for sure](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html) according to Noah

My uncertainity lies in how do you define good?

How much time I need to prep for an eco master?

Frankly speaking Harvard is obviously not for me.




### How much good can you do?

[Here is one low probability scenario](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) working in the US federeal
Government agency. 

The article shows a true EA't who clearly looked at numbers and did
some amazing things. He seems very much in touch with reality, seems
to truly understand the value of one goddamn human life. So fucking
Inspiring. Wow. 

Coming back to actual impact, the author claims that a 20 year career
high of the person who interviewed him to be: raising some questions
during a meeting that probably has saved farmers from tens of millions
of dollars, in total. Thats it.

And probably nothing to this level will ever happen again.

>This is what you can expect your direct impact to be as an agency
>economist: find ways to save people money and make life a little less
>difficult for them, while still accomplishing the mission of the
>agency. This is a good life and a noble calling, for those who think
>about efficiency and the big picture, and it is unreasonable to
>expect more.

The author also shared his own stories in this regard wherein he ended
up with saving an estimated 400 lives (somehow only). Plus he also
earns more than 100k and is able to donate 30k, saving atleast 10k
people .

The key points to remember are:

>The main message of this story is that the direct impact of a
>government economist is extremely high-variance. Most of the time,
>you will do nothing to make the world better. Occasionally, you will
>do something that prevents a few million dollars from being
>wasted. And if you get very very lucky, you might do something that
>saves the statistical equivalent of hundreds of lives.

### Am I good enough?

- High grade (min. 3.5+)

Based on [authority conversion of dutch score to US](https://www.studyinholland.nl/documentation/grading-systems-in-the-netherlands-the-united-states-and-the-united-kingdom.pdf) and wiki's [internal
US conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States), I think my grade is 4.0/4.0. [Another source](https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/764/how-are-grades-different-in-the-netherlands-compared-to-the-us.html)
suggests that my grade 3.75. Both seems to be decent. 

- I will work hard on quants and try to obtain 165+ in GRE

I think I can. But Verbal I have no control over.

- Good reference letters

This is the thing that I have not much idea about.

  
#### Working @ effective altruism organizations

**Basic qualifications**

>If you’re a highly self-motivated individual who cares deeply about
>the ideas of effective altruism, we think it’s one of the
>highest-impact things you can do with your career.

>If you’re a good fit for one of the positions, and believe in the
>ideas of effective altruism, we think that working at an EA
>organisation is one of the highest-impact things you can do with your
>career.

[Why?](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#why-is-working-at-an-ea-organisation-high-impact)

Types of roles
- research 
- marketing and outreach
- product management
- operations
- Management

>Meet the leaders of the organisations by attending EAG
>conferences. Demonstrate your fit by commenting on organisations’
>blogs, volunteering at EA Global conferences, helping to run local EA
>groups, and doing freelance work and internships. 

>If you’re a good fit for one of the positions, and believe in the
>ideas of effective altruism, we think that working at an EA
>organisation is one of the highest-impact things you can do with your
>career.


But won’t I be replaceable? 

>Some people worry that since a lot of people want to work at
>effective altruist organisations, if you don’t take a job, someone
>else who’s capable will do it, so you won’t have much impact. They
>also often think that they should earn to give instead – take a high
>earning job and donate to these organisations, since their donations
>won’t be replaceable.

Exactly what I was thinking.

**Impact**

>To get a sense of how much value you create by working at an EA
>organisation, we asked the organisations how much funding they would
>have traded for their most recent hire. They gave an average of
>$126,000 – $505,000 and a median of $77,000 – $307,000 per year.4
>Some of the organisations gave figures as high as $1m. There is
>incentive to inflate these figures in order to attract hires,5 but it
>at least suggests that these hires are expected to have a major
>positive impact on the organisation.

>This is substantially more than most people could donate, even if
>they work in one of the highest-paying industries. This suggests that
>if you could get one of these jobs, your personal fit is similar to
>other recent hires, and you think these organisations are effective,
>it would be better to do that than to earn to give.



## Todo

copy 80k ranking in the samel excel, 

look at all comments and propose actions

re-edit english and non-repeatability of text of the whole 14k essay.

Continue excel to detail out more info like salary, etc... etc..

Discuss with Ram ... estimating prolties like when you add more and
more, the value become sless.!

Where can I come in with my innovation?

Where can I be most useful?
Because there are people already doing things, why should I go there,
when I do not know if I can add value to it. Earning to give I
understand, but direct work not sure.


- There are others to do these kind of things, what is your
  contribution then? 

<!-- Settling the debate of number of lives saved -->

<!-- Add? job security? -->

<!-- Growing old -->

<!-- >30 and learning -->

### Plan
		
  * [ ] [Career planning tool ](https://80000hours.org/career-planning-tool/)
  * [ ] [research decision tool](https://80000hours.org/career-decision/)
  * [x] [investigate risk aversion](https://80000hours.org/career-decision/)
REad some stuff got no where!
  * [ ] RE-writing main parts of the essay
  * [x] Re-writing the prolties from sheet to emacs
  * [x] making the impact calculations
  * [ ] Final analysis
  * [ ] MC vs DS 
  * [ ] uncertainities of DS for DW 

Getting a job in DW after DS
MC to DW skills?
DS vs SE
  * [ ] Explain the probability calcs and theories
Such as "having same events for diff
      prolties"
XxCC = YxImpact; X? Y?

and the total impact calculations

  * [x] Fix blog to clean it
  
  * [ ] 30 years 20 to 30 prime?  

  * [ ] Get feedback from
Rajesh, Sivagagnam, Ram, Praneeth burra and talk to them about
uncertainities

  * [ ] Apply for coaching
  
  * [ ] Plan ABZ
  * [ ] Name your uncertainities

### Probabilities

I want to attempt to make the events equal and factor in rams
suggestions, so that I can have decent estimates of prolty. then I
want to add some more sheets that will calculate the impact and
personality fit reliably

First I am going to look at the number of events and see how many I
need to come up with

Then I am going to check if there are any other probabilities that I
left out.

In the case of Econ Phd and MC I have 6 events!

  * [x] Events for which I don't need to check personal fit and impact?
  
  * [x] Try for MC and see the net contribution to the result
  
  * [x] Check if the calculations are ok?
  * [x] Check if impact calc are ok?
  * [x] check if prolty * impact calcs are ok?
  * [ ] Wrap it up
  * [ ] name your uncertainities in the end
  * [x] Send to Vinod sivagagnam style
  Time to sum up?
Continue this! good job

### ideas
	
What If I take another 6 months to evaluate by trying out some things
like economics, MBA etc... 

MEanwhile also write about persuation.

Did anyone ask you everyone asks you how your weekend was ? 

Godfordome, what about my goals?

## Rant

How do I want to make the excel sheet with all the numbers?

I think I should just keep Design Engineering earning to give, DEsign
engineering building skills to work in an NGO.

And when I talk about startups or working in startups after 5 years of
work around here, I can make contributions due to
DE,DS,MC, etc... Most likely I think they will be the same, but I will
do it there. OK?

That settles it.

- to give money either by starting up 
<!-- these numbers need justification, looks like they are pulled out -->
<!-- of someones ass. -->
	The probability of succeeding in starting up, seems to be dependent on:
	- Chance of having the vision to be a Y-combinator level startup and
          applying (5%)	  
	- chance of getting accepted in Y-combinator (2.5%)
	- Chance of that startup succeeding (25% based on current
      [Ycombinator list](https://yclist.com/) of 11 years)
	- = 0.03% (by multiplying everything) [0.003/10]

17 year olds were affected much more by interference in learning than
were 9 or 12 year olds.

Quoting some scientist
https://www.fastcompany.com/3045424/what-it-takes-to-change-your-brains-patterns-after-age-25

In the above article they talk about how we can make new pathways when
we are young and that as we get old it will be harder. I doubt that I
am unable to learn something new say when I am 32. 

Granted it will slower than I can now due to the plasticity thingy,
granted there will be young people who are faster than me in
that, but I suppose I have laid down some foundation for it. By that I
mean it won't be completely new.

The thing I am worried about is about having enough time to learn it
and having opportunities to intern and then change job.

I am looking for an answer where people tell me "Don't try to learn
someting completely new at the age of 35" for example.

### Earning potential if you make partner 

**Impact**

- partner after 45

	- At associate level we get 130k 
	- after 5 years 250k
	- after 7 years 450k
	- 600k + bonus after 7 more years say
	- inflation of 2%
	- retiring at 57
	- getting 75% last drawn for the rest of life (another 20 years
      atleast)
	- I didn't take into account the bonuses which is expected to be a
      lot more.


- Earning by once we leave industry in 5 years

	- With compound interest of 4% a year
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- for a beginners salary of 150k (assumption i.e., after quitting
      MC)
