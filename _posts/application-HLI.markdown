**Briefly, what's your current plan for making lives happier? *
We do not expect you to have a definite answer to this question;
please describe how you are thinking about this problem.**

Get better at "critical thinking", "Rationality", statistics, writing,
and research (using Deliberate practice)

Break into EA orgs in the coming years with ETG Data Science as backup.

Work in or start an Aspiring EA org in GH&P.

**Why do you think you are a good fit for this role? *
Please list your key points.**

- I have 2 years of research experience (albeit in another field)

- EA is the purpose of my life. It is very important to me to have
  maximum counterfactual impact. It is why I spend 20-30 hrs every
  week in addition to my day job on EA skills related activities.
  
- I think I am good at communication and my job involves me regularly
  communicating with stake holders.
  
- I am a quick learner. At work I am able to pick up new and different
  tasks quickly and I thrive in such situations.

- I like seeking challenging assignments. and I thrive in such
  situations.

**Which giving-opportunity do you currently think is highest impact and why? *
No need for more than ~5 sentences.**

Giving to GiveWell recommended charities in GH&P and MIRI in
Longtermism. I give 10% in total to both orgs.

GiveWell recommended charities, because 40 people are working on it to
produce the "best" research. Also GiveWell charities seem to be able
to absorb a lot more money. For example AMF can receive 100m$ more
than it is projected to receive. I don't want to try to second guess
them now (when I am working on other things).

MIRI, because they seem to be to doing fundamental research in AI
which is very important. I respect Eliezer as a rationalist, too
much. Following that they met 50% of their of 2019 fundraiser, which
is really sad as they would really like to grow.

**Say it costs $50 to provide 1 course of Cognitive Behavioural
Therapy (CBT) to someone with severe depression in a low-resource
setting. Please estimate the cost-effectiveness of this
intervention. We suggest you use $/DALY or $/"wellbeing-adjusted
life-year". * We're most interested in how you got to your answer, so
show your reasoning. Please don't google anything or spend longer than
10 minutes on this question.**

DALY = Years of life lost due to disability (YD) + Years of life lost
due to death (YLL)

Assuming disability weights (w=0.5) larger than that associated with a
blind person (w=0.2) .

Assuming 5 CBT Therapy courses reduces YLL and YD by half.

Assuming avg life expectancy in low-resource setting is 70y.

Assuming avg. life expectancy of "severe depression" in a low-resource
setting is 50y.

Assuming the avg. age of life lived to whom this course is given to be
30.

DALYs without CBT = 0.5x50y + (70-50)y = 45y

DALYs with CBT = 0.5x30y + 0.25x(60-30)y + (70-60)y = 32.5y

CE=DALY's/cost = (DALYs with 5 CBT-DALYs without CBT)/50$/5 =
12.5/50/5 = 0.05 DALYs per $. For 1$ invested you get 18 days of life
in return.
