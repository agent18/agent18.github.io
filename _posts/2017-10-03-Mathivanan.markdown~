#### Problem

Recently been struggling with motivating myself to do things that are important to myself. Such as Cardio, Gym, writing creating impact, making money only to give etc...

Scooby says in his website,
> if you have only 20minutes of time in a day for excercise. Do cardio.

That is how important cardio is. And yet I find myself struggling to keep it up. This is the thrid week and it is quite hard for me to feel great while doing cardio.

It's outdated to say "be like batman, make the decisions no one can make". But its hard without motivation.

I have been working out at the gym full time for 3-4 weeks now, 4-5 days a week atleast. And I am afraid the beginning where I do rotisserrie workout for 15 mins is boring. I want to go inside lift straight up. I don't want to do silly stuff, atleast not when I see I am loosing my ability to do more. I can go to the gym almost everyday, as long as I feel epic when I come out. I remember leg day, I finish with squats. Do you have any idea, how I feel when I sweat my fucking ass off pulling off the last sets! Thats not what I see on push day, pull day is the worst.

I told my friend I will write for 2 hrs every day and come up with 2.5k proper post at the end of the week. Oh god kill me, why did I even sign up for this. IT's hard.

#### time of deadline, close to deadline, close to reward or punishment
When do people file their taxes when the deadline is in april?
as close as possible to the end.

A few weeks back, when did an agent write most of the 2.5 k words?
on friday, usually until 4 or 5. I remember 1 time, when I was at 1.2k. and god forbid how the fuck I managed to finish it on that day with 2.5 k. The reason I guess I finished it because I had huge money on the situation, and the stake of respect from an STM else I would be considered lite.

When are you motivated to give or do great service?
When I see someone in need of my services, when I see southsudan

#### Challenging to the point

Why do people (I) procrastinate on doing laundary or cooking or buying grocery?

What jobs did agen like at work?
Ones that kept me on my toes, ones that had new things to learn, ones that were out of my comfort zone, once that involved solving problems that I was able to. For my thesis, I spent a large amount of my time, writing python code. My writing scripts in python task at work.

Apparenty you have 108 bits to occupy and a task that fits all these bits is challenging enough, something that doens't need all, is not. Something that needs a lil more is just outside your comfortzone. Some thing that needs a lot more is completely out of your comfort zone. This is what is called flow.


#### Feedback reward
How long can you play Games?
Forever! Why? feedback: +1, Smack. I can't remember the countless hours of AOE I played in my life.

Programmers seem to be able to go on and on with working, STM, Aaron IBa, my friends roommate. All claim they love programming. Probably its quite challening? I wrote a lot of pyhthon code for a software as part of my thesis. I am infomred that the mere action of compiling your code and getting it to run can give you enough motivation to keep working. enough feedback that you are doing a good job. Less errors, etc.. I seem to engage with such a sentiment.I have this wague feeling where I thought of becomming a programmer, and I know quite a few people looking to programme! or wanting to jump from their work to something related to programming. Of course the whole thing is hyped.

Most of my thesis was reading papers and implenting those ideas in python in software and testing them. I remember my friend telling me that he can work on such assignments thoroughout the night. And I susect I can too. I have worked overnight on such assingmnets and I suspect without getting bored. It somehow was like a game where you got a tiny place ahead and then you got further and further while you build the whole ship. I can't remember feeling it like a chore. Well this is a chore, not programming adn getting omthing to work. I guess that is what it is about. the feedback you get and the whole thing being actually challenging enough to get things to work.








#### Using your brain at full capacuity

Why humans have boredom?
To make sure they should always be working at full capacity. You need to work at full capacity always use all your ram, so that you can make the best of the situation, you dont know what will happen when, you need to be aware of the surrounding. On a dark alleyway, youare at your full capacity because only then can you save yourself.

#### Where do you feel Motivation
A few weeks back I did work as a trouble shooting engineer. I remember telling myself, wow. I didn't get a minute of break. I was working in peak form getting shit done, because delays would cost us money. At 15 hrs is when I was able to take a break to eat. I just didn't want to eat. I wanted to finish the work. I didn't feel uncomfortable, I was just running possibly at full capacity.

I go to the gym 5 times a week. I suspect I am going there primarily to get a great body. But, for example, today, I am thinking about my baby squats and how motherfucking awesome its going to be to kill at those sets. I am clinging to the feeling I had last time or some time I guess. The day when I did squats, when I was pushing myself to do the last rep and I was sweating AF from just moving slowly. Thats when I knew (feedback) that motherfucker did some work today. Motherfucker tore some muscles. Oh boy am I excited about leg day tomorrow.

Many days I am excited abotu work. Solving problems I suspect is the one that drives me. And as you solve problems, the day keeps getting better? I suspect. I feel bored at work, but thats when I have to update some lame as procedure, do some crazy ass manual work (I do it only while listening to music). When I am on my toes, sufficiently solving a problem that I just can work on, something challenging. And ofcourse a  now and then, good job from my DL. This is what keeps me going at work. The time when I was doing design, time would fly, with so much things to do.

Basket ball. I used love playing that sport. Everyweek I used to play with who ever was available. I love playing, I love playing and most importantly I need to score for my team, do some incredible passes, some great plays some blocks. These are the things that would make me want to play more. If I sucked in a week, I have had the motivation to practice through the week to imporove.


#### Some examples where motivation actually happens

#### The equatoin of motivation

  $ Mathivanan=Capacity*feedback/delay of reward

The rudimentary equation of motivation seems to be the above. The question is how to we make our lives geratly motivated to the task that we need absed on this shit.

Cardio
During cardio I don't know about the capacity of my work, basically, I need to push to a huge point. The  problem is I don't know how far I am supposed ot push. Pushing too much in the beginning causes exaustion. Overall cardio is seeming to become hard cause I don't have the tools to let me know how I a doing.  I am not sure what I can do with capacity. But I suspect I can do with feedback. I have been thinking the solution to my motivation problem being buyin g a new cycle, which I can change gear and ride fast, probably see more scenray. But If you look closely, it has never been clearer to me, my oh my, its feedback. I don't know what spped I am supposed to do with my bike. So I am thinking speedometer. I am thinking one that shows me speed. This way, I can make estimates of what speed I should try to average. This is my goal. Despite wind(control activity by going both directions), I think it is easy to keep getting constant feedback from the instrument so that  I can know how much more I need to travel. I still have my doubts about how to make the whole thing solid and what happens when I max out?. It is one of my biggest worries. That how will I motivate myself further. I guess there are several people in the world doing this, they somehow get the motivation. I am pretty convinced that the speedo meter should terll me what I am doing and then from there I know what is my average. and I will work with it from there. Cheers!

Of course I can measure the distance and the time. This will tell me how I did today. What to expect tomorrow? How to keep it slightly out of the comfort zone?

#### How is a bike going to change motivation

#### How is a speedometer going to change 
Right now, I don't have feedback until the end. If I had some meter informing about my heartrate or speed of travel I would get feedback then and there. Of course that is not enough, I need to know what average i need to maintain, and go by it. See if I am sticking to it everyday. Also as soon as I am done I get the distance. I have the time on my phone. Oh fuck.... I can see distance/ 5 mins, 10 mins, 20 mins and 30 mins. I understand holland has some winds and some slopes. I usually try to take the routes which do not stop me and routes that take me in and against the direction. I suspect it doesn't change it much. I want the feeling of finishing.

I suspec this is it. But why didn't your phone work? I guess it is becuase, I dont trust the reading. I forget to switch on the
