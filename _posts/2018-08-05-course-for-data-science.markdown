## Introduction

Based on [this](/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html) article, I have almost decided to take up Data
Sciences. With this blog, I hope to find and justify the use of a
particular course. 

## What am I looking for

A course on which I can spend a 6x20 (120hrs) hrs to learn DS. No
adambaram, simple just follow the course.

Speaking to DS.

>To get an entry-level job you usually need basic familiarity with a
>statistical programming language like R or Python, statistics, basic
>machine learning algorithms, database systems and data communication
>and visualisation.

[Roman Duda of 80k suggests this
courseera course for ultra beginners](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) looks like the 10 set
capstone project suggested in quora, and looks good to start, costs
50$ a month.


Still want to investigate 2 other course atleast or check with Body!

## DS Scholarship

Why financial aid?

I earn 40k euros, I pay a lot of tax and have a huge loan from studies
to pay. In addition to this I give 10% of my income (4k Euros/year) to
Effective Altruism Charities. My budget is so tight that I am able to
spend on things like vacations as I also need to have some runway, in
case I lose my job. I want to do this course over 1-1.5 years as I
have a full time job (~10hrs per day) and also need to work on a
project related to Effective altruism. I do not have 600-900 $ for the
course. My current job is in a startup and I am not sure this job is
going to last long, so I want to move to DATA Science by next year. I
am also moving into Data Science as the skills I get there are the
ones needed by Effective Altruism Organizations such as Give Well and
80k hours. I hope to work in those organizations within the next 5
years.

Align with career goals?


As said above, I see this course offering me a road into the life of
Data Science. There are a lot of jobs I see available and I hope to
get a stable job in Data science and gain lots of flexible career
capital by improving in statistics, critical thinking and programming
with which I want to move into Effective Altruism Organizations over a
period of 5 years. I am very keen on the Effective Altruism Movement
and I am positive this course will align me in that direction.

Loan?

I don't mind getting a loan, but I am not stable enough right now to
pay it. I don't know if I would be in the future as well. If you
suggest starting the course and paying once I successfully port to DS,
then I am very much interested in the loan. Thank You for considering
my application.
