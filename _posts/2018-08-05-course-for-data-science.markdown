## Introduction

Based on [this](/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html) article, I have almost decided to take up Data
Sciences. With this blog, I hope to find and justify the use of a
particular course. 

## What am I looking for

I am looking for a course on which I can spend ~6x20 hrs (120 hrs) to
learn DS. I just want a course where I can follow said material in an
ordered way to get a grip of the basics of DS. This is how I want to
start. I hope this is enough to already start applying for jobs in DS.

>To get an entry-level job you usually need basic familiarity with a
>statistical programming language like R or Python, statistics, basic
>machine learning algorithms, database systems and data communication
>and visualization. - 80k hours career guide

I will find courses and run it by my DS friend.

[Roman Duda of 80k suggests this coursera course for ultra
beginners](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). It is the same as the 10 set capstone project suggested
in quora, and looks like a good to start. Costs are about 40€/
month. I hope to finish it in less than 2 months.

There is a coarse [CS109](http://cs109.github.io/2015/) for DS by Harvard. Surprisingly all the
[lectures and slides](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html) are available. The [Assignments from 2013 and
2014](http://cs109.github.io/2014/index.html) along with solutions are available as well (bottom of the
page). There are some videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0-KaiZFXBlGOFN71YsEV8g/videos) made by cs109 for tutoring on
some small parts like git etc... This seems to cost 0€.

A course by udacity known as the [Data analyst nano degree](https://in.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) costs
about 550€ for a 160 hr (30% off with code UMQXGK87482XHCN, So the
cost should come to 385€).

This [quora answer on DS resources](http://qr.ae/TUIJ91) seems to be very informative,
regarding where to learn basics, where to get data from. The same
question has developed an [answer wiki](http://qr.ae/TUIJ9N) which also contains
multiple sources for doing things. The way the answer is formed is
that we quickly learn some basics and get into doing projects and
learning from there.

Should I just start with projects? What projects do I do? Or which
course do I then take?

As per the suggestion of a friend in DS I take the Courseera course
and finish it and see where it takes me.

I think [this kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/hiteshp/head-start-for-data-scientist) is like a project with a summary
submitted for a competition, something which I should hope to achieve
as part of my training.

## If applying for DS Scholarship

Why financial aid?

I earn 40k euros, I pay a lot of tax and have a huge loan from studies
to pay. In addition to this I give 10% of my income (4k Euros/year) to
Effective Altruism Charities. My budget is so tight that I am able to
spend on things like vacations as I also need to have some runway, in
case I lose my job. I want to do this course over 1-1.5 years as I
have a full time job (~10hrs per day) and also need to work on a
project related to Effective altruism. I do not have 600-900 $ for the
course. My current job is in a startup and I am not sure this job is
going to last long, so I want to move to DATA Science by next year. I
am also moving into Data Science as the skills I get there are the
ones needed by Effective Altruism Organizations such as Give Well and
80k hours. I hope to work in those organizations within the next 5
years.

Align with career goals?


As said above, I see this course offering me a road into the life of
Data Science. There are a lot of jobs I see available and I hope to
get a stable job in Data science and gain lots of flexible career
capital by improving in statistics, critical thinking and programming
with which I want to move into Effective Altruism Organizations over a
period of 5 years. I am very keen on the Effective Altruism Movement
and I am positive this course will align me in that direction.

Loan?

I don't mind getting a loan, but I am not stable enough right now to
pay it. I don't know if I would be in the future as well. If you
suggest starting the course and paying once I successfully port to DS,
then I am very much interested in the loan. Thank You for considering
my application.
