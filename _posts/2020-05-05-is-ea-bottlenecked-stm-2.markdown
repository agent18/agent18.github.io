## Entry question

I would like to know if EA Orgs are able to hire enough people with
specific skill-sets (e.g., researcher with 2 years of experience) for
a given pay (e.g., 70k`$`). I would like to know if EA Orgs have a
"lot" of "good candidates" to choose from. I would like to know if
funding is stopping them from hiring people.

## Introduction

In the following discussion, I have *not used* "for a given pay" as I
don't have any examples for them. Similarly, certain positions such as
director of operations or fundraising people are not considered as I
don't have evidence for it.

I started off with writing out the claims and examples, checked if it
matched the definition, and reiterated a few times before I came to
this post in this format.

With the following post I look into the following aspects:

1. If EA Orgs are able to find and hire skilled people that they want.

2. If there are "many" "good" candidates.

3. If there are EA Orgs unable to hire due to lack of funding.

## Are EA Orgs able to find people?

**Finding people**

EA Orgs seem to be able to hire the number of people they want, *at
the end of the hiring round* be it in *research or operations*. [OPP
wanted to hire 5 GRs in 2018](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting) and succeeded in it. [EAF set out to
hire 1 GR and 1 Operations](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/d3cupMrngEArCygNk/takeaways-from-eaf-s-hiring-round) personnel and managed to do
that. [FWI](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YGBgWfLqeqCCWfnmK/hiring-process-and-takeaways-from-fish-welfare-initiative) also managed to get a researcher and "welfare
specialist".

[RP, RC, CS](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC#ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC) and [TLYCS](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=tojT8rKhwCz9rfJbB#ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC) seem to suggest that they have no
problem finding people (researchers I think [based on their recent
hires](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2237265641%22%5D)).

> I’ve certainly had no problem finding junior staff for Rethink

> from Charity Science)…  and so far we’ve been lucky enough to have
> enough strong senior staff applications that we’re still finding
> ourselves turning down really strong applicants we would otherwise
> really love to hire. --- Peter Hurford

However, EA orgs *don't* seem to be able to hire the number of
*Entrepreneurs* they want, *at the end of a hiring round*. CE in 2019,
during its incubation program was only able to [accept 17 people](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship)
despite having ~20 positions. Apparently (in an email to me), they
would have hired more if there were better candidates. *However*, this
year they have more than 10 times the applications of last year for
the same number of positions and CE thinks that they would *probably*
find more people than they have seed grants for.

*Note:* *I don't have more info on other hiring rounds and so stick with
the above for most of the rest of the discussion as well.*

<br>

It is *unclear* if the type of organization (Longterm, GH&P, Meta,
Animal EA) relates to finding a hire or not. OPP (Meta), TLYCS, RC,
RP, CS (GH&P), FWI (Animal EA) are able to find hires. But it is not
clear what are the struggles of Orgs such as MIRI or FHI in finding
people (Longtermism) as I don't have those examples.

---
<br>

**Quality of hires**

EA orgs are able to hire Researchers (in the last 2 years), either
with greater than 3 years of experience related to EA, or people who
studied in top universities (based on rankings) in [UK](https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings) and
[US](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities), or PhD's in Philosophy or Political sciences or Economics or
Math or relevant (e.g., PhD in Marine life for FWI). A look at the
recent hiring rounds seems to agree with the claim above. Saulius,
however seems to be an exception. But he seems to have [done other
things (such as to write and criticize EA research on his own)](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but?commentId=AiZ96d7trvcBh9jMg) to
grab the eyes of recruiters who requested him to apply for the
vacancy.

Whether you are a new org or an old org you are able to hire
Researchers (in the last 2 years), either with greater than 3 years of
experience related to EA, or people who studied in top universities in
UK and US or PhD's in Philosophy or Political sciences or Economics or
Math or relevant (PhD in Marine life for FWI). RP and FWI are orgs
founded in or after 2018, GiveWell in 2007 and OPP in 2014. The same
table above is used as evidence.

EA Orgs seem happy with their recent hires. ~~It does not look like
they had to settle for someone with "lesser experience", when they
wanted someone with "more experience".~~ [OPP said](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting) they got more
than 100s of "very good resumes" for the GR positions. In the end they
thought multiple people from the pool who didn't make it, *would
exceed at OPP in the future*.

[TLCYS](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=tojT8rKhwCz9rfJbB) suggests that he is confident and able to find
"high-quality" candidates. CE in an email said that they have an
absolute bar and wouldn't take anyone if they didn't pass that bar. As
far as they hired they seem to be happy with the level of the hires.

*Was that too "vague"?*

## How many people

**Number of "good quality" people**

The acceptance rates of EA Orgs are similar to [top Universities](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities)
like Harvard and the [best startup incubator](https://tendercapital.com/en/the-ten-best-startup-incubators-in-the-world/) Y-combinator. The
following are the acceptance rates for EA Orgs ([OPP](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting), [EAF](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/d3cupMrngEArCygNk/takeaways-from-eaf-s-hiring-round),
[CE](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship), [FWI](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YGBgWfLqeqCCWfnmK/hiring-process-and-takeaways-from-fish-welfare-initiative)) followed by Top universities ([<rank 10](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities)) and
Y-combinator, and followed by moderate universities ([>= rank 20](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities)).

| 2018 | Florida (#34)       | student                             |   42% |

Looking at the acceptance rates it appears that EA Orgs are hard to
get in just like the top Universities. I am unsure anything related to
the number of "good quality" people can be derived from here.

--- 
<br>  
New Orgs seem to have similar visibility as older Orgs (number of
people applying per position). In [FWI's (founded in 2019) hiring](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YGBgWfLqeqCCWfnmK/hiring-process-and-takeaways-from-fish-welfare-initiative)
round for researcher there were roughly 40 apps for 1 vacancy. In
OPP's (founded in 2014) 2018 hiring round for GR, there were more than
20 apps for 1 vacancy.

---
<br>

EA Orgs seem to think that there are *more candidates fit for the job
than the ones they hired* in *research*. [OPP said](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting) they got more
than 100s of good resumes for the GR positions. In the end they
thought multiple people from the pool who didn't make it, *would
exceed at OPP in the future*. [TLCYS](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=tojT8rKhwCz9rfJbB) suggests that he is confident
and able to find high-quality candidates. [Peter of RP said](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=s9wuF9QQgjfHvfPAB),

EA orgs seem to think that there are *NOT many candidates fit for the
job than the ones they hired* in *Entrepreneurship*. CE had ~20
positions and were able to [fill only 17 in 2019](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship). But in 2020 with
more than 10 times the applications as in 2019, it is *probable* that
they have more "acceptable" candidates than the people they hire.

--- 
<br> 

I am unable to say more about the type (PhD's, yoe) and the number of
people who didn't manage a job because of reasons such as, the orgs
didn't have money to hire more, or the orgs were management constrained
etc. I don't have any data or even one example regarding the unhired
people who were "good enough" to be hired.

I assume for now (for lack of other better alternatives) that the
number of candidates in the last round gives an indication of how many
were fit for a job. Most of the final rounds had 2x the number of
people hired, for *research* positions. (And orgs had about 5 rounds
including initial application.)

[OPP had 17 people](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting) in the trial round while hiring for 5
people. [EAF had 4 people](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/d3cupMrngEArCygNk/takeaways-from-eaf-s-hiring-round) in the trial round while hiring 2
people. [FWI had 4 people](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YGBgWfLqeqCCWfnmK/hiring-process-and-takeaways-from-fish-welfare-initiative) in the last round, which was a
"reference check and call with finalists", while hiring 2 people in
the end.

The final rounds in orgs hiring for Entrepreneurship, don't seem to
have 2x the number of people hired. [CE in 2019 had 27](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship) people in
the last round compared to 20 people they wanted hire *!= 2x*. It
could be different in 2020 where they have 10 times the applications
as last time for the same number of positions.

## Jobs in govt/academia in AI Policy

[80000hours](https://80000hours.org/articles/us-ai-policy/#ai-policy-challenge): "Senior staff within governments and top AI labs tell
us that they are *struggling* to find experienced and qualified AI
talent to employ". I have 0 examples to understand this. I have no
idea what each of the words refer to as I don't have an example. I
don't know what "struggling", "experienced", "qualified AI Talent",
"top AI labs", "senior staff within governments", means. How many jobs
are there? how many jobs were they not able to fill? Did they end up
hiring people withe lesser experience? I don't know. 

In the [case for working in AI policy](https://80000hours.org/articles/us-ai-policy/#ai-policy-challenge), 80000hours seems to suggest
that there could be *many* jobs in this field. But, there doesn't seem
to be 100s of jobs in Govt./Academia ([>20](https://80000hours.org/articles/us-ai-policy/#ai-policy-challenge)) in AI Policy in one
year. A look at the 80000hours job board seems to identify only [10
positions including internships, in companies, non-profits, academia
and Govt](https://80000hours.org/job-board/ai-safety-policy/) over a 3 month period. This translates to 40 per year at
max, including companies non-profits, academia and Govt.

<!-- Even if we look at 80ks example of DoD's JAIC now and its progress in -->
<!-- the last 2 years, it *appears* about 10 people have been hired in -->
<!-- policy (conservatively) since 2018, 5 per year. And they have only [40 -->
<!-- in total (as per Linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dod-joint-artificial-intelligence-center/about/) not 200 (as they envisioned in 2018). -->


<!-- This is tedious to test, as I have to look at 20+ orgs and gather. But -->
<!-- a quick check at the orgs I know of and their open Policy related -->
<!-- positions, points to the following: DOD JAIC has no vacancies now; -->
<!-- DeepMind, No; OpenAI, 1 Policy manager; FHI, 0; This doesn't say any. -->

<!-- 80000hours suggests that there are many agencies (>20) and many more -->
<!-- in academia and that here there ought to be "many" jobs. I don't want -->
<!-- to go to each of these and then add it up. A quick check on the open -->
<!-- Policy related positions, points to the following: DOD JAIC has no -->
<!-- vacancies; DeepMind, No; OpenAI, 1 Policy manager; FHI, 0; With -->
<!-- companies like Facebook and Microsoft it is hard to discern which jobs -->
<!-- are related to AI policy. So my conclusion is *I don't know*. -->

80000hours also suggest that in the future we will need a ["lot of
people"](https://80000hours.org/articles/us-ai-policy/#ai-policy-challenge). It is not possible to test that. But it shall be noted
that LOT means atleast 20 senior people with the right background
working in the 20 or so US Govt. agencies that will be involved.

--- 
<br>

There seems to be an underlying assumption that AEAs will have more
impact than the people who take up these "senior roles" or other roles
in academia and govt. I don't have any example for this either.

## Funding: Short on cash to hire people

Meta Orgs don't seem to be affected by funding while considering
hiring researchers. [OPP said](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting), "our current ability to immediately
assess and deploy this base of available talent is weak".

It is not clear if hiring is affected by funding in Longtermism
Orgs. There is not info I can find regarding this on MIRI for example.

---
<br>  

There are orgs working on GP&H, seem to be willing to hire more
research candidates but are short on cash. [TLYCS's Jon Behar](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=tojT8rKhwCz9rfJbB) says
that here,

However, orgs in GH&P hiring for entrepreneurship don't seem to be
short on cash. CE (via mail) says that, they were not having any
issues with money, but suggest that this year (2020) the situation
might be different due to the 10 times more applications.

Whether you are a new or an old org you seem to want money to get more
hires. RP is a new org (founded in 2018) and would like money to get
more hires, but so does TLYCS (founded in 2010) and the whole RC
(2013) CS franchise according to Peter which were founded many years
ago.

**Fundraisers**

Some Longtermism Orgs are unable to meet their fundraising targets as
small as 1m`$`.

~~MIRI in [2017](https://intelligence.org/2017/12/01/miris-2017-fundraiser/) managed to raise all of the 2.5m.~~ MIRI in
[2018](https://intelligence.org/2018/11/26/miris-2018-fundraiser/) was short by 250k (trying to raise 1.2m). In [2019](https://intelligence.org/2019/12/02/miris-2019-fundraiser/) they
were short by 400k (trying to raise 1m). The severity of this is
expressed here:

I don't know the scene with GH&P or Meta Orgs regarding fundraising. I
don't see any fundraising efforts by GiveWell, RC, RP, CS or OPP for
example. ~~GiveWell and OPP seem to be covered for the most part by
[Good Ventures and non-restrictive donations](https://www.givewell.org/about/FAQ).~~

## Reflection

**Disentanglement research redacted**

I re-read the [disentanglement research (DR) post by Carrick
Flynn](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RCvetzfDnBNFX7pLH/personal-thoughts-on-careers-in-ai-policy-and-strategy). It seemed to contain opinions on whether DR is
"bottlenecked" across whole of EA. What I am interested in are things
such as if FHI is able to find people for their vacancies or even a
statement such as "you clear the bar you WILL get the job at FHI and
that they are always hiring for DR researchers". But I didn't see
anything like that in Carrick's post. Hence it was decided to not use
that content.

**No more holistic decisions on claims**  

I forget to check the example against the definition correctly. In the
[last post](http://agent18.github.io/is-ea-bottlenecked-3.html), I mainly looked only at one claim. The claim was that,
"EA Orgs are able to find people with specific skills at the end of
the hiring round". For this what I needed was to check hiring rounds
and if they hired those people with specific skills that they
wanted. 

But what I did implicitly is look at the rejection rates, number of
people who applied, comments on the how good the talent pool was, how
many people made it to the work trials etc... And somehow
"holistically" got the impression that EA Orgs are able to find the
people they set out to need.

This doesn't seem to be a proper way to go about claims. For example,
I seem to have factored in rejection rates, but I had no idea of what
rejection rate was high or low. I looked at how many people made it to
the work trials, and figured that was somehow "good enough". I should
have been explicit about all these proxies and should have tested them
individually.

**Narrow the claims and feel better**

When people say "TC" now, it hurts. I realize I don't know what they
are talking about anymore. Instantaneously I feel confused. There are
atleast 5 definitions that I know of[^1]. Jesus! Pick one at a time
and feel better.

**Split into familiar claims and question people**

People asked me a lot of questions and added further claims such as
"You can't judge TC based on rejection rates", "Orgs probably hired
'lesser capable people' and hence said they were TC", "new Orgs have
problem with funding, what you have is an anomaly", "there are many
jobs in the govt for AI Policy, surely it is TC" and "What more can we
do, we already asked the Orgs if they are TC". 

I don't feel tensed and confused about how to deal with these claims
anymore. I know that I can split the claims into narrow claims and
have a discussion as opposed to just shrinking my face in confusion
and not knowing how to proceed.

P.S.  
I answered "Yes, I agree we can't do more", to "What more can we do,
we already asked the Orgs if they are TC". Damn it! Split into
familiar claims.

**Don't just write, think in claims and examples**

I tried writing the previous paragraphs on "reflection" and the main
post, and seemed to be ending up with a lot of words, feeling confused
(head hurts) not knowing where this was going. Then I changed to "what
claim am I trying to make", followed by an example. And it seems to
have gone "smoother". Less "confused", more "organized" types.

**Too soon to judge**

I am too soon to judge an example as satisfying the claim. When I
heard an example that DoD JAIC was looking for 100s of people, for the
claim: "EA needs people in AI Policy", I was like wow! This is a great
example, showing that there are many jobs in the govt, for EA
people. The claim is true I thought immediately. I even called it a
beautiful example. But when I spent time on understanding it, it took
me more than 3 hrs.

First, the assumption I made was that people who identify as EA
somehow make "better impact" at such positions than people who don't
(for which I don't have any examples of). Additionally, Dod JAIC was
looking for all sorts of people, not just AI Policy people. 2 years
since they seem to have hired 40 people in total (as per LinkedIn) and
a conservative estimate suggests that there would be 10 people in
policy across all seniorities. So 5 people per year have been
hired. Not 100s of jobs in JAIC, just 5 per year.

**Re-write a fresh**

Send distractions to the footnote. Don't force yourself to keep them and
weave them in the post. You are out here to find the truth and not weave
all the research you have done into a flowing story.

Re-writing in a fresh sheet and re-factoring old stuff seems to have
helped in this regard. I got rid of many things I was clinging on to
and struggling to weave into the story (such as a section on "why I
think EA is TC", A section on 'definitions' etc.). It was taking so
much time to make it all fit into a story, until I removed those
sections completely.

## Footnotes

[^1]: **Definition 1**

	80k defines TC in "[Why you should work on Talent gaps](https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/#what-are-talent-gaps)" (Nov 2015)
	as,

	> For some causes, additional money can buy substantial progress. In
	> others, the key bottleneck is finding people with a specific skill
	> set. This second set of causes are more “talent constrained” than
	> “funding constrained”; we say they have a “talent gap”.

	So, a cause is TC if finding people with a specific skill set, proves
	to be difficult. The difficulty I assume is in the lack of those
	skilled people, and not some process/management constraint[^3]. "[EA
	Concepts](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/talent-constraints-vs-funding-constraints/)", clears this confusion up with a better worded
	"example":

	> Organization A: Has annual funding of $5m, so can fund more staff,
	> and has been actively hiring for a year, but has been unable to find
	> anyone suitable... Organization A is more talent constrained than
	> funding constrained...

	**Definition 1.1**

	When Orgs hire "lesser people", as "better people" are not available,
	can also be considered TC according to one EA.

	**Definition 2**  

	TC seems to also stand as a proxy for other things most notably used
	by people from 80000hours themselves. [Banjo talks about it here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z9x56yiX2ceRZnKTR/a-naive-analysis-on-if-ea-is-talent-constrained?commentId=uS7YvonDGRfrznaZq):
	"These roles (referring to policy roles in Govt.) are all ‘talent
	constrained’, in the sense that hundreds of people could take these
	positions (in govt.) without the community needing to gain any
	additional funding". That seems quite different from what TC meant in
	Definition 1.

	**Definition 3**  

	In addition, imagine an org that isn't able to hire researchers
	because of "insufficient upper management people", "don't want to grow
	too fast", "some inability to asses and deploy the available talent
	now". Such an org can also say they are TC.

	**Definition 4**

	And when an org that doesn't have funding to hire new staff, it could
	claim that they are TC because they are unable to hire new staff.
