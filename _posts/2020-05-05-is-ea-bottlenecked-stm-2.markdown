## Entry question

I would like to know if EA Orgs are able to hire enough people with
specific skill-sets (e.g., researcher with 2 years of experience) for
a given pay (e.g., 70k`$`). I would like to know if EA Orgs have a
"lot" of "good candidates" to choose from. I would like to know if
funding is stopping them from hiring people.

## Introduction

In the following discussion, I have *not used* "for a given pay" or
"for x years of experience", as I don't have any examples for
them. Similarly, for every claim, I have not talked about any
position/org that I don't have evidence for (such as CEO or director
of operations etc.)

I started off with writing out the claims and examples, checked if it
matched the definition, and reiterated a few times before I came to
this post in this format.

With the following post I look into the following aspects:

1. If EA Orgs are able to find and hire skilled people that they want.

2. If there are "many" "good" candidates.

3. If there are EA Orgs unable to hire due to lack of funding.

## Are EA Orgs able to find people?

**Finding people**

EA Orgs seem to be able to hire the number of people they want, *at
the end of the hiring round* be it in research, operations and
*possibly* even charity entrepreneurship. [ OPP wanted to hire 5 GRs
in 2018](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting) and succeeded in it. [EAF set out to hire 1 GR and 1
Operations](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/d3cupMrngEArCygNk/takeaways-from-eaf-s-hiring-round) personnel and managed to do that. [FWI](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YGBgWfLqeqCCWfnmK/hiring-process-and-takeaways-from-fish-welfare-initiative) also managed
to get a researcher and "welfare specialist". [RP, RC, CS](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC#ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC) and
[TLYCS](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=tojT8rKhwCz9rfJbB#ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC) seem to suggest that they have no problem finding people
(researchers I think).

> I’ve certainly had no problem finding junior staff for Rethink
> Priorities, Rethink Charity, or Charity Science (Note: Rethink
> Priorities is part of Rethink Charity but both are entirely separate
> from Charity Science)…  and so far we’ve been lucky enough to have
> enough strong senior staff applications that we’re still finding
> ourselves turning down really strong applicants we would otherwise
> really love to hire. --- Peter Hurford

CE in 2019, however during its incubation program was only able to
[accept 17 people](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship) despite having ~20 positions. Apparently (in
email), they would have hired more if there were better
candidates. *However*, this year they have more than 10 times the
applications and CE thinks that they would *probably* find more people
than they have seed grants for.

*Note:* *I don't have more info on other hiring rounds and so stick with
the above for most of the rest of the discussion as well.*

<br>

**Quality of hires**

EA Orgs seem happy with their recent hires. It does not look like they
had to settle for someone with "lesser experience", when they wanted
someone with "more experience". I am unable to be specific as I don't
have any examples for them. Unfortunately, all I have is testimonials
from the Orgs.

OPP said they got more than 100s of "very good resumes" for the GR
positions. In the end they thought multiple people from the pool who
didn't make it, *would exceed at OPP in the future*.

[RP RC CS Personnel Peter said](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=s9wuF9QQgjfHvfPAB),

> Based at least on my recent hiring for Rethink Priorities, I can

[TLCYS](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=tojT8rKhwCz9rfJbB) suggests that he is confident and able to find
"high-quality" candidates. CE in an email said that they have an
absolute bar and wouldn't take anyone if they didn't pass that bar. As
far as they hired they seem to be happy with the level of the hires.

**Number of good quality people**

The acceptance rates of EA Orgs are similar to top Universities like
Harvard and in the best startup incubator Y-combinator. The
following are the acceptance rates for EA Orgs ([OPP](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting), [EAF](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/d3cupMrngEArCygNk/takeaways-from-eaf-s-hiring-round),
[CE](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship), [FWI](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YGBgWfLqeqCCWfnmK/hiring-process-and-takeaways-from-fish-welfare-initiative)) followed by Top universities ([<rank 10](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities)) and
Y-combinator, and followed by moderate universities ([>= rank 20](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities)).

| 2018 | Florida (#34)       | student                             |   42% |

Looking at the acceptance rates it appears that EA Orgs are hard to
get in just like the top Universities. I am unsure anything related to
the number of good quality people can be derived from here.

EA Orgs seem to think that there are more candidates fit for the job
than the ones they hired.

[OPP said](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting) they got more than 100s of good resumes for the GR
positions. In the end they thought multiple people from the pool who
didn't make it, *would exceed at OPP in the future*.

[RP RC CS Personnel Peter said](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=s9wuF9QQgjfHvfPAB),

[TLCYS](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=tojT8rKhwCz9rfJbB) suggests that he is confident and able to find high-quality
candidates.

CE had ~20 positions and were able to [fill only 17 in 2019](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship) but in
2020 with more than 10 times the applications as in 2019, it is
*probable* that they have more "acceptable" candidates than the number
they hire.

--- 
<br> 

I assume for now (for lack of other better alternatives) that the
number of candidates in the last round give an indication of how many
"good quality" candidates, Orgs had. Most of the final rounds had 2x
the number of people hired.

[OPP had 17 people](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting)in the trial round while hiring for 5 people.[
EAF had 4 people](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/d3cupMrngEArCygNk/takeaways-from-eaf-s-hiring-round) in the trial round while hiring 2 people. [FWI
had 4 people](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YGBgWfLqeqCCWfnmK/hiring-process-and-takeaways-from-fish-welfare-initiative) in the last round which was "reference check and call
with finalists", while hiring 2 people in the end.

[CE in 2019 had 27](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship) people in the last round compared to 20 people
they wanted hire *!= 2x*. But then again we should remember that in
2020 they have had more than 10 times the applications for the same
number of positions (20) as in 2019.

---
<br>

It is *unclear* if the type of organization (Longterm, GH&P or Meta)
relates to finding a hire or not. OPP (Meta), TLYCS, RC, RP, CS (GH&P)
are able to find "good hires". But it is not clear what are the
struggles of Orgs such as MIRI or FHI in finding people (Longtermism).

## Jobs in govt/academia in AI Policy

Apparently, "Senior staff within governments and top AI labs tell us
that they are *struggling* to find experienced and qualified AI talent
to employ". Honestly I don't know if they are talking about Policy
people or technical people or strategy people. I don't have any
example for this anyway. So I can't test. I don't understand how bad
the talent pool is of their hiring rounds and I don't have more info
on that as well.

In the [case for working in AI policy](https://80000hours.org/articles/us-ai-policy/#ai-policy-challenge), 80000hours seems to suggest
that there could be *many* jobs in this field, citing DoD's new JAIC
(2018) which is expected to hire 200 people by 2020 (not all in Policy
though). 80000hours suggests that there are many agencies (>20) and
many more in academia and that here there ought to be "many" jobs.

But, there doesn't seem to be 100s of jobs in Govt./Academia in AI
Policy in one year. A look at the 80000hours job board seems to
identify only [10 positions including internships in companies,
working in non-profits, academia and Govt](https://80000hours.org/job-board/ai-safety-policy/) over a 3 month period.

Even if we look at DoD's JAIC now and its progress in the last 2
years, it *appears* about 10 people have been hired in policy
(conservatively) since 2018, 5 per year. And they have only [40 in
total (as per Linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dod-joint-artificial-intelligence-center/about/) not 200 (as they envisioned).

<!-- 80000hours suggests that there are many agencies (>20) and many more -->
<!-- in academia and that here there ought to be "many" jobs. I don't want -->
<!-- to go to each of these and then add it up. A quick check on the open -->
<!-- Policy related positions, points to the following: DOD JAIC has no -->
<!-- vacancies; DeepMind, No; OpenAI, 1 Policy manager; FHI, 0; With -->
<!-- companies like Facebook and Microsoft it is hard to discern which jobs -->
<!-- are related to AI policy. So my conclusion is *I don't know*. -->

80000hours also suggest that in the future we need a ["lot of
people"](https://80000hours.org/articles/us-ai-policy/#ai-policy-challenge). It is not possible to test that. But it shall be noted
that LOT means atleast 20 senior people with the right background
working in the 20 or so agencies that will be involved.

--- 
<br>

There seems to be an underlying assumption that AEAs will have more
impact than the people who take up these "senior roles" or other roles
in academia and govt. I don't have any example or data on this to
check it.

## Funding: Short on cash

Orgs working on Global Poverty and Health, seem to be willing to hire
more candidates but are short on cash. [TLYCS's Jon Behar](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=tojT8rKhwCz9rfJbB) says
that here,

> TLYCS’s experience is very consistent with Peter’s. Money is
> overwhelmingly the constraining factor, with more funding we’re
> confident we can get high quality candidates.

[PH representing RP, RC, CS says](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC#tojT8rKhwCz9rfJbB),

> I personally feel much more funding constrained / management
> capacity constrained / team culture “don’t grow too quickly”
> constrained than I feel “I need more talented applicants”
> constrained.

However, CE of the Incubation program (via mail) says that, they were
not having any issues with money, but suggest that this year the
situation might be different due to the 10 times more applications.

---
<br>
Hiring is not affected by funding in meta Orgs. OPP said that, "our
current ability to immediately assess and deploy this base of
available talent is weak,". 

It is not clear if hiring is not affected by funding in Longtermism
Orgs. There is not info I can find on this on MIRI for example.

 
---
<br>
**Fundraisers**

Some Longtermism Orgs are unable to meet their fundraising targets as
small as 1m`$`.

MIRI in 2017 raised all of the 2.5m. MIRI in 2018 was short by 250k
(trying to raise 1.2m). In 2019 they were short by 400k (trying to
raise 1m). The severity of this is expressed here:

> "Given our $6.8M budget for 2020, and the cash we currently have on
> hand, raising $1M in this fundraiser will put us in a great position
> for 2020. Hitting $1M positions us with cash reserves of 1.25–1.5
> years going into 2020, which is exactly where we want to be to
> support ongoing hiring efforts and to provide the confidence we need
> to make and stand behind our salary and other financial commitments.

I don't know the scene with GH&P or Meta Orgs regarding fundraising. I
don't see any fundraising efforts by GiveWell and OPP for
example. GiveWell and OPP seem to be covered for the most part by Good
Ventures and nonrestrictive donations.

## New org vs old org 

Whether you are a new org or an old org you are able to find good
quality candidates. OPP, TLYCS, RC, CS are all able to find "good
quality candidates". They are all Orgs founded before 2015 atleast. RP
is certainly new ([founded in 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rethinkpriorities/about/)). Peter assures us that the
candidates are "good".

<br>
New Orgs don't seem to have much lesser visibility than older Orgs
(number of people applying per position). In [FWI's (founded in 2019)
hiring](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YGBgWfLqeqCCWfnmK/hiring-process-and-takeaways-from-fish-welfare-initiative) round for researcher there were roughly 40 apps for 1
vacancy. In OPPs 2018 hiring round for GR, there were more than 20
apps for 1 vacancy.

---
<br>
Whether you are a new or an old org you seem to want money to get more
hires. RP is a new org (founded in 2018) and would like money to get
more hires, but so does TLYCS (founded in 2010) and the whole RC
(2013) CS franchise according to Peter which were founded many years
ago.

## Reflection

**Disentanglement research redacted**

I re-read the [disentanglement research (DR) post by Carrick
Flynn](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RCvetzfDnBNFX7pLH/personal-thoughts-on-careers-in-ai-policy-and-strategy). It seemed to contain opinions on whether DR is
"bottlenecked" across whole of EA. What I am interested in are things
such as if FHI is able to find people for their vacancies or even a
statement such as "you clear the bar you WILL get the job at FHI and
that they are always hiring for DR researchers". But I didn't see
anything like that in Carrick's post. Hence it was decided to not use
that post.

**No more holistic decisions on claims**  

I forget to check the example against the definition correctly. In the
[last post](http://agent18.github.io/is-ea-bottlenecked-3.html), I mainly looked only at one claim. The claim was that,
"EA Orgs are able to find people with specific skills at the end of
the hiring round". For this what I needed was to check hiring rounds
and if they hired those people with specific skills that they
wanted. 

But what I did implicitly is look at the rejection rates, number of
people who applied, comments on the how good the talent pool was, how
many people made it to the work trials etc... And somehow
"holistically" got the impression that EA Orgs are able to find the
people they set out to need.

This doesn't seem to be a proper way to go about claims. For example,
I seem to have factored in rejection rates, but I had no idea of what
rejection rate was high or low. I looked at how many people made it to
the work trials, and figured that was somehow "good enough". I should
have been explicit about all these proxies and should have tested them
individually.

**Narrow the claims and feel better**

When I say "TC" now, it hurts. I realize I don't know what they are
talking about anymore. Instantaneously I feel confused. There are
atleast 5 definitions that I know of[^1]. Jesus! Pick one at a time
and feel better.

**Split into familiar claims and question people**

People asked me a lot of questions and added further claims such as
"You can't judge TC based on rejection rates", "Orgs probably hired
'lesser capable people' and hence said they were TC", "new Orgs have
problem with funding, what you have is an anomaly", "there are many
jobs in the govt for AI Policy, surely it is TC" and "What more can we
do, we already asked the Orgs if they are TC". 

I don't feel tensed and confused about how to deal claims anymore. I
know that I can split the claims into narrow claims and have a
discussion as opposed to just shrinking my face in confusion and not
knowing how to proceed.

P.S
I answered "Yes, I agree", to "What more can we do, we already
asked the Orgs if they are TC". Damn!

**Onions at 10rs/kg**

Contrast "OPP has low rejection rates for PhDs", with "OPP has low
rejection rates". The first claim seems to weed out all the fluff
applicants and tries to get info on rejection rates per "good set of
candidates" (PhDs). The second seems not so useful to verify.

**Don't just write, think in claims and examples**

I tried writing the previous paragraphs on "reflection" and seemed to
be ending up with a lot of words, feeling confused (head hurts) not
knowing where this was going. This seems to have also happened in the
previous re-writes of this essay. Then I changed to "what claim am I
trying to make", followed by an example. And it seems to have gone
"smoother". Less "confused", more "organized" types.

**Too soon to judge**

I am too soon to judge an example as satisfying the claim. When I
heard an example that DoD JAIC was looking for 100s of people, for the
claim: "EA needs people in AI Policy", I was like wow! This is a great
example, showing that there are many jobs in the govt, for EA
people. The claim is true I thought immediately. I even called it a
beautiful example. But when I spent time on understanding it, it took
me more than 3 hrs.

First, the assumption I made was that people who identify as EA
somehow make "better impact" at such positions than people who don't
(for which I don't have any examples of). Additionally, Dod JAIC was
looking for all sorts of people, not just AI Policy people. 2 years
since they seem to have hired 40 people in total (as per LinkedIn) and
a conservative estimate suggests that there would be 10 people in
policy across all seniorities. So 5 people per year have been
hired. Not 100s of jobs in JAIC, just 5 per year.

**Re-write a fresh**

Send distractions to the footnote. Don't force yourself to keep it and
weave it in the post. You are out here to find the truth and not weave
all the research you have done into a flowing story.

Re-writing in a fresh sheet and re-factoring old stuff seems to have
helped in this regard. I got rid of many things I was clinging on to
and struggling to weave into the story (such as a section on "why I
think EA is TC", A section on 'definitions' etc.). Shit was taking so
much time.

<!-- **Systematic way?** -->

<!-- First you check if people are hired. Second you check if these hired -->
<!-- people are as good as they set out to be. Third you check how many of -->
<!-- these people are there. That's it. Simple. building up over narrow ass -->
<!-- claims. -->

	So, a cause is TC if finding people with a specific skill set, proves
	to be difficult. The difficulty I assume is in the lack of those
	skilled people, and not some process/management constraint[^3]. "[EA
	Concepts](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/talent-constraints-vs-funding-constraints/)", clears this confusion up with a better worded
	"example":

	> Organization A: Has annual funding of $5m, so can fund more staff,
	> and has been actively hiring for a year, but has been unable to find
	> anyone suitable... Organization A is more talent constrained than
	> funding constrained...

	**Definition 1.1**

	When Orgs hire "lesser people", as "better people" are not available,
	can also be considered TC according to one EA.

	**Definition 2**  

	TC seems to also stand as a proxy for other things most notably used
	by people from 80000hours themselves. [Banjo talks about it here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z9x56yiX2ceRZnKTR/a-naive-analysis-on-if-ea-is-talent-constrained?commentId=uS7YvonDGRfrznaZq):
	"These roles (referring to policy roles in Govt.) are all ‘talent
	constrained’, in the sense that hundreds of people could take these
	positions (in govt.) without the community needing to gain any
	additional funding". That seems quite different from what TC meant in
	Definition 1.

	**Definition 3**  

	In addition, imagine an org that isn't able to hire researchers
	because of "insufficient upper management people", "don't want to grow
	too fast", "some inability to asses and deploy the available talent
	now". Such an org can also say they are TC.

	**Definition 4**

	And when an org that doesn't have funding to hire new staff, it could
	claim that they are TC because they are unable to hire new staff.
