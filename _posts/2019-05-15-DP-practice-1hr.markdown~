## Poisson's distribution from coursera notes

This is from the lecture on poisson obtained from [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference/lecture/mAKj5/06-03-poisson).

For 1 and 2, we think of the plot of "number of plane crashes in a
given year" form 1995 to 2018.


For 3, we think of problems like below:

## Poisson distribution introduction JB statistics

> A (poisson's distribution)[1] is another (important)[2] and
> (discrete)[3] (distribution)[4].

For 1 we think of a the following graph below:

![poisson image](./images/images-DP-3/poisson.png), where \lambda is the mean (explained below).

For 2: When we want to estimate the probability that 3 or fewer plane
crashes will occur this year we can use the [poisson's distribution to
determine it](https://youtu.be/sv_KXSiorFk?t=775). 

For 3, number of plane crashes per year being equal to 3

For 4, we think of the following graph of probability vs outcome for a
die roll

![die roll dist](./images/images-DP-3/die-roll-dist.png)


**Claim**: [1] is [2]

[1] is [2] because it allows to predict probability of plane crashes
in a given year.

**Claim**: [1] is [3]

Poisson's distribution can be used for identifying the probability of number of plane
crashes in a year (which is discrete, 2 plane crashes, 3 plane
crashes, 10 plane crashes).

> earth at a rate of approximately 2 per million years. 
>
> What is the (probability)[5] that in a (randomly selected)[6] million year
> period, there is exactly one collision?

For 5, we think of a die roll and the (chance of getting an outcome)[5a] 5
is 1/6. 

For 5a, we roll a die a 10k times, and plot the number of times each
outcome (1,2,3,4,5,6) has occurred divided by 1000. This should be 0.16

For 6, we think of a 

![lottery](./images/images-DP-3/lottery.png)


**Claims**: No claims here!

> Suppose,

> - (events)[7] (are occurring)[7a] (independently)[8] (in time)[8b].


For 7&7a, we think of a plane crash.


For 8, we look at the [plane crashes in 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft). 

Event 1: A US airways flight ditches into the Hudson River just after
taking off due to total engine failure, due to multiple bird strike

Event 2: Another plane crash occurs due to engine failure, but due to
[an overweight take off, which the engine was unable to handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Manaus_Aerot%C3%A1xi_crash).

Event 1 is would have happened irrespective of Event 2 happening or
not. Conversely, Event 2 would have happened irrespective of Event 1
happening or not.

for 8b, we think of the year 2009.

For 7 we think of a coin tosses ending up in heads or tails.

For 7a we think of tossing a coin and getting Heads.

For 7&7a, we think of the outcome being 1 as a result of a die roll. 

For 8, we think of 2 coin tosses. Probability of coin toss 1 getting
Heads is 0.5. Probability of coin toss 2 for Heads is 0.5. i.e., coin
toss 2 is not affected by coin toss 2.

For 8b, we think of coin toss 1 and coin toss 2 happening one after
the other after 1 second.

For 7, we think of 3 cars in 1 hr crossing Street X.

For 8&8b, 

When you take an unbiased coin, the (probability)[8c] of H is 0.5 in
the first hour. The probability of H is 0.5 in the second hour and 3rd
hour as well.

Similarly, we think of the (probability)[8d] of 3 cars passing in the
first hour and the second hour and third hour and the fourth hr is
exactly the same. Just because 3 cars passed in the first hour,
doesn't mean the probability changes in the 4th hour.

For 8 we think of 3 chocolate chips in a randomly selected volume of
1cm^3 in a dough mixed with chocolate chips. We see here that the
probability of finding 3 chocolate chips in a randomly selected volume
is X, When we repeat this experiment the probability is still the
same.

Let's consider another example where we add fresh set of chocolate
chips, on the dough and do not mix. The probability of finding 3
chocolate chips in 1cm^3 is Y. It appears that when we take another
volume to find if there are 3 chocolate chips, the probability of
finding 3 chocolate chips is still the same.

For 8c, we think of 500/1000; 1000 coin tosses and expect 500 of them to be heads.

For 8d, we think of 500/1000; out of 1000 hours we expect 500 of them
to have exactly 3 cars passing Street X.

*Is this "good enough"? Can you give some feedback here. I use more
examples for myself to "understand" the "difference". It is very hard
to give examples of independence in the context of poisson's
distribution. All examples also are made up.*

> - the (probability)[9] that (an event occurs)[10] in a (given length
>   of time)[11] (does not change through time)[12].

For 10, we think of a plane crash.

For 9, we think of the probability being 

For 11, we think of one year time period

For 12 we think of the period between 2009 to 2019.

If P of a plane crash is 1 in 11 million in one year. Let's say 3 plan
crashes occured this year already, it doesn't mean that the
probability of a plane crash i

*I am not sure what this means, I have guess the meaning. Somehow, the
sources that I look at, i.e., youtube, books, do not like giving
examples for each of the above case. So in the end I am just left with
an interpretation. With repect to a Die I have it figured out, with
respect to Basketball I understand it, but with plane crashes I just
cannot give an example, because I don't really know what probability means.*


For 10, we think of rolling a die and getting a 5 as outcome.

For 9, we think of 1/6 being the chance of getting a 5 when a die is
rolled.

For 11, we think of 1 toss 

For 12, we think of 10 tosses, 100 tosses.

**Claim**: probability of 10 in 11 does not change with time




The "probability" of getting a 1/6 irrespective of the many die tosses
is always 1/6. Doesn't matter if you get 1/6 in the last try.

Here the only known definition of prolty is that when I roll it 1000
times I see that it is 1/6.

In other words Lebron James has a free throw percentage of say 75%
throughout his career. Let's say he's at a game and he attempts 19
free throws and he makes 14 of them. Now does this mean on his 20th
free throw that there is a 100% chance of him making it? No it still
means that there is a 75% chance of making it. The only thing this 75%
says is that if you make 10k FTs you are expected to make 7500 of
them. That is all it says. It's all about long numbers.

A case when this is violated is: Say you have 2 prize tickets in a
raffle of 10 tickets. P(getting a prize) = 2/10. Once the 1st prize is
given, the P(2nd prize) = 1/9 = 0.11. The probability changes through time. 


For 10, we think of the Cars passing Street X.

For 9, we think of 3 cars passing street X within 1 hr.

For 11, we think of 1 hr

For 12, we think that in no way if 3 cars pass this hour, that somehow
only 0 cars will pass the next hour. With every hr the probability is
assumed to be the same. 

*At this point it appears that both the statements seem to meaning the
exact same thing, as the examples provided are exactly the same!*

For 13, we think of 3 cars crossing street X

For 14 we think of 1 hr 

For 15 we think of 

![poisson image](./images/images-DP-3/poisson.png)

**Claim**: If events are occurring independently in time and the
probability that an event occurs in a given length of time does not
change through time, then Number of occurrences is a Poisson's
distribution.

Number of occurrences of  [plan crashes in a year follows a Poisson's
distribution apparently](https://youtu.be/sv_KXSiorFk?t=837). We see that number of plane crashes in

For 16&19: If 3 cars pass in the first hour, 2 cars in the next and 5
cars in the next and 2 cars in the next, then the mean is 3 cars per hour.

For 17 we think of 3 cars passing in the first hour.

For 18, we think of 1 hr

For 20, we think of this:

	((3-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 +(5-3)^2 + (2-3)^2)/4 = 1.5 


**Claim:** Not only the mean but also the variance is $\lambda$ (in a

## Lorentz actuator

> (Lorentz actuators)[1] are (predominantly)[2] applied in (high
> precision)[3a] (positioning systems)[3] because of their (inherent low
> mechanical stiffness)[4] between the (stationary)[5] and the (moving
> part)[6].

For 1, we think of the following picture where a current carrying coil will move right
or left when it is placed in a magnetic field.

![lorentz](./images/images-DP-3/lorentz.png)

For 2, we think of every stage used in every type of ASML Machine, there are
atleast 6 Lorentz actuators

For 3, we think of a WAFER moving stage in ASML machines, needs to
move 0.5um with 50 m/s^2 acceleration.

For 4, we think of a long loose rope connecting a ship and you. When
the ship moves, you will feel nothing until the rope becomes
tight. Similarly, let's say the coil is moving at 1mm/s to the
right. If I move the yoke by 1mm to the left, the coil will continue
to move to the right at 1mm/s simply unaffected (provided the magnets
always cover the coil as shown in the above picture).

In ASML, typically vibrations in the order of nanometers from the
yoke, will not be passed on to the coil due to the low mechanical
stiffness.

For 5, we imagine the yoke being fixed with bolts to the ground

For 6, we imagine a current carrying coil moving.

**Claims:**  


> [1] is applied in 3,3a because of [4]

Lorentz Actuators are used in ASML XY position stages, primarily so
that disturbance (running motor causing vibrations) from the outside
world does not get transferred through the yoke to the moving coil,
aka low stiffness like a loose rope.


> Also the (linear relation)[1] between (current)[2] and (force)[3]
> combined with the (favorable)[5] (dynamic properties)[6] are
> (important factors)[7].

For 1, think of the relation below where if current increases by 1N,
then Current will increase by say 1 A (assuming BL=1N/A)

	F = L I B; 
	L- windings
	I- current
	B- magnetic field


For 2, think of 1A in the coils

For 3, we think of 1N push on the coil of the actuator

For 5 & 6, we think of the low stiffness of say 0.001N/mm , like that of a
"loose" rope connecting a ship and I. 

*not sure about this number or even if this is how it works as none of
the data sheets seem to show what this stiffness is for lorentz
motors*

For 7: we  imagine the ASML stage, which needs to move 1nm and stay
there within +- 1nm. If a machine is running next to it, it will
change the position of the stage from 1nm to 3500 nm. Having a lorentz
motor allows the stage to stay at 1nm+-1nm even though machines next
to it are moving by 3500 nm.

**Claims:**  

> 5,6 are "important factors"

Having low stiffness we  imagine the ASML stage, which needs to move 1nm and stay
there within +- 1nm. If a machine is running next to it, it will
change the position of the stage from 1nm to 3500 nm. Having a lorentz
motor allows the stage to stay at 1nm+-1nm even though machines next
to it are moving by 3500 nm.

> 1 is an important factor.

*Why exactly a linear relation helps is not known to me. It probably
has to do with linear control and non-linear control, but I need to
talk to folks to get this info. Here I know that people in the
industry generally fear non-linear systems.*

> The (low stiffness)[1] (reduces)[2] the (amount of external motion)[3]
> that is (transferred)[4] from the (support structure)[5] through the (actuator)[6]
> to the (moving part)[7] ((transmissibility)[8]!).

For 1, we think of the made up 0.001N/m

For 3, we think of 3500nm

For 2, we think of 3500nm to 0nm

For 4, we think of stage being moved to 3500nm from 1nm in case motion
is transferred.

For 5, frame of the machine in which the stage is

For 6 we think of the loretz actuator discussed above

For 7 we think of the moving coil connected to the stage

For 8, we think of 3500nm from the external machine to the stage
reduces to 0nm, which means there was no transmissibility (aka 0).


**Claims**  

> [1] reduces [3] transferred to [7]

ASML regularly uses lorentz actuators to avoid disturbance in the order
of nanometers, i.e., 3500nm of movement to 0nm at the stage.

*Maybe I need to write about how the transmissibility is 1, well it is
also actively controlled!*

*I agree that these numbers are made up out of my intuition. I need to
talk to some people on monday to understand what is their expectation
or understanding. I can speak to Niels, maybe lakerfeld or verboom See
who is approachable and ask them some questions.*

For 1, we think of turbopump running at 80000 rpm present in the same
machine as the stage shaking the parts next to to 10 microns.

For 2, we think of the 10 microns of movement from the turbopump
running in the adjecent machine which is 1m away.

For 3, when the stage accelerates with 50m/s^2 and weighs 1kg, it
creates a force of 50N on the Yoke as well.

For 4, we think of a turbopump in the same machine as the stage.

For 5, we think of 

![lorentz](./images/images-DP-3/lorentz.png)

For 6, i dont' have an example for its drawbacks, other than in
theory, as mentioned in [7] and [8].

![force-lorentz](./images/images-DP-3/force-lorentz.png)

*I don't need to understand these documents to the letter,
unfortunately. Although it is clear how much I suck at it now that I
try to give an example. The very foundation that it has low stiffness
and what in the actual fuck it means is absolutely not clear. What is
limiting the acceleration is not clear, maybe the price of magnets? or
the amount of magnetic field and windings!*

> Lorentz (1853 – 1928) formulated the (Lorentz force)[3] as a

For 1, we think of Albert Einstein, and his "theory of relativity"

For 2, we think of Albert Einstein once again

For 3, we think of the force in the coil in the below picture when the
yoke is held in place

![lorentz](./images/images-DP-3/lorentz.png)

For 5, we think of [these equations](https://brilliant.org/wiki/maxwells-equations/)

*Not sure if I am expected to come up with other things than the
equations, an example perhaps of the usage of one of the equations?*

For 6, I don't know what he meant by completeing and ho

[3] is a "completion" to 5? come back to it!???

For 6, 

*how can you give an example for the law?*

For 8, we imagine a fixed point and a magnet that moves away from and
towards it, like below. Say it changes from 5T to 40 T in 4s

![faraday masturbation](./images/images-DP-3/faraday.png)


For 9, we think of a copper wire loop with a resistance of 2 ohms.

For 10, we think of the electrons moving in the loop and as a result
showing  2.5 A on the amp meter.

For 11, we think of electrons moving in the loop with a velocity.

*I am not giving an example for 11, as it will take more than an hour
to come up with the right example, as I have to redo my fundamentals
in current. I leave this for now and move on with knowing that I have
failed to provide an example here.*

**Claim**

[8] on [9] generates electricity from [11].

Based on [this](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/magnetic-forces-and-magnetic-fields/magnetic-flux-faradays-law/v/faradays-law-example), When the magnetic field changes from 5T to 40T in
4s, then we have a current generated of 2.5A as a result of the
charges moving.

> energy)[13] from (motion)[14] is (fully complementary)[15] to

For 12, we think of "(the total energy)[12a] of an (isolated system)[12b]
(remains constant)[12c]"

For 12b, we think of a pendulum on a friction-less joint (roller
bearing), we lift the ball of mass 1kg to a height 1m. 

For 12a, sum of kinetic energy and potential energy = `mgh`

For 12c, you let go of the pendulum, 

At that point, KE =0 and PE = mgh ; total = mgh

At the mid point the KE = mgh, and PE =0; total = mgh

At the other extreme the KE = 0 and PE = mgh; total = mgh

For 13, Current of 2.5 A as a result of varying magnetic field from 5T
to 40T in 4s.

For 14, we think of motion of the magnet to produce a change from 5T
to 40T.

For 15, I don't know what it means, I suspect it is fluff!

For 16, we think of the moving coil in the lorentz actuator 

For 17, we think of the current in the coil

For 18, I do not know what is the point and what they mean by that.

**Claims**


> 13 from 14 is 15 to 16 from 17

No idea what complimentary might mean in this case!

> the Lorentz and Farady are "strongly related

No idea!

For 1a, we think of pick and place robots, wafer scanners

For 1, we think of every wafer stage (made by ASML).

For 3: At ASML, in one of the products, there is a stage which needs
to move at 40g's and expected accuracies of positioning are 1/10
nanometers. This stage is also connected to a cable slab. 

For 2: The stage defined above moves from 0 to 100mm within 0.02s. The
cable slab also follows it. When the stage stops the cable slap
continues to oscillate and is capable of moving the stage in the order
of mm and will not settle in 10ms. A controller, actively reads the
position every 10000th of a second and provide movement to the
stage so as to counter act the motion introduced by the cable Slab.

For 3&5, we think of the wafer stages at ASML once again.

For 6, we think of stages with accelerations moving at 0.5m/s

For 7, we think of the wafer stage connected to lorentz actuators.

For 8, we think of the same example as in [2].

For 9, we think of a wafer stage moving at 0.01mm per second

For 10,10a, The stage is expected to move from 0mm to 300mm.

For 10c, positioning the stage at nm accuracy within 10ms

For 11, correction to the stage needs to be applied every 1ms.

For 12, applying correction every 1ms instead 0.1ms

*I use the word dynamics 40 times a day, and yet when it comes to
examples, I whimper like courage the cowardly dog when he sees a
ghost*

**Claims**

> Most Mechatronic systems are actively controlled motion systems

ASML stages, pick and place robots we see in automotive factories


> [2a] is actively controlled implies it is of [6].

ASML Stages are actively controlled and they move at ridiculous speeds
of 0.5m/s [6].

> if [7] does not show any dynamics[9], then [10c] becomes [11]

When a stage moves at 0.01mm/s [9] and stops at say 10mm then,
positioning the stage within a resting time of 10ms [10c] can be done by
reading the position every 1ms and providing correction instead of
every 0.1ms[11].

> [10c] is trivial[12] when [7] shows no dynamics[6]

When a stage moves at 0.01mm/s and stops then, positioning the stage
within a resting time of 10ms can be done by applying a correction
every 1ms instead of 0.1ms[12].

For 0, with think of kuka making robots and ASML making stages

For 1, we think of ASML stages which need position within 10nanometers
within 10ms

For 2, we think of stage moving at 0.01mm/s and stopping at a value
say 10mm. The correction applied to the position is done at 1ms
instead of 0.1ms

For 3: if a stage is at 0.03mm instead of 0.02mm, then a "proportional
force" of 0.24mN is provided by the actuator to bring it to 0.03mm.

For 4, we think of a cable slab attached to the stage. When the stage
stops suddenly (from 10m/s^2 to 0m/s^2 acceleration) the cable slab
continues to oscillate 5 to 10mm's. This creates a force on the stage
that moves it from current position(0.03mm) to +- 10nm.

For 5, we think of a controller black box which brings the stage to
0.03mm +- 1nm within 10ms by varying the forces in the actuator.

For 6, we think of what happens when there is no control, i.e., the
stage would oscillate with +-10nm for atleast 1s (exceeding the budget
by 100 times).

For 7, we think of settling of the stage,
within 10ms after accelerating at 10m/s^2.

For 8, we think of the settling of the stage at 0.03 mm within 1nm, @
0.02mm within 1nm etc...

For 9 we think of the movement of the stage by 0.01mm within 0.5nm,
between any two points!

For 10, we think of an excitation at 10hz and magnitude of 1N which
the cable slab gets due to the neighboring machine. Because of this
the stage will move +-10nm (let's say). The controller needs to counter
this deviation by moving the stage opposite to the excitation or damp
this out!


**Claim**


> In most motion control systems, [2] is not the case

With Kuka robots and ASML stages, we do not have parts moving at
0.01mm/s with a settling time of >10ms.

> In most motion control systems, [3] of [4] via control is required

ASML stages are connected to cable slabs. The stages accelerate at
50m/s^2 and stop within 10mm. When they stop at 10mm, the cable slab
continues to vibrate at say 150Hz with an amplitude of >1mm leading to
moving the stage beyond +-10nm budget. In this case, a "controller" is
used to counter the motion of added to the stage by the cable
slabs. If the stage moves at 1hz with an amplitude of 10nm, then the
controller uses the actuator to move the stage in the opposite
amplitude.

For 1, we think of (proportional control)[1a], "integral control" and
"differential control"

For 1a, we think of stage at 10mm that needs to go to 20mm. The Force
applied on the actuator varies with how close the stage is to
20mm.

	F=k_p x (20mm-current position)
	
Here K_p is a constant.

For 2, 3 and 4,5 we think of earlier examples. 

For6, we think of the stage moving to different spots on the wafer
starting from the centre and moving outwards at 50m/s^2 for every 10mm

For 7, we think of the above trajectory but that needs to happen so
that the stage can handle 200 wafers per hour!

For 8, I have no idea what the author is trying to say.

**Claim**

its a trivial claim covered above in example 6 and 7, not going to
deal with it!

For 9, think of ASML stages where positions need to be within 10nm

For 10&11, we think of stages where

For 12 we think of

For 1, we think of getting a sample with mean of difference in heights
of fathers and sons = 0.99, 1 time out of 100000000 samples picked; as the
probability is 0 in this case. 

For 2, we think of the difference in height between father's and their
son's to be 0

For 2a&2 together, we think of, assuming that the mean of the father's
height be equal to the mean of the Son's height

For 3a, we think of the dataset available in R called "father.son",
which contains heights of fathers and sons in pairs.

For 3, mean of difference between the pairs is 1 inch ( in the sample
we have while we expect it to be 0 inches +- 0.08 inches
(std. deviation/ sqrt(n))

For 4, we think of mean of difference >1inch

For 5, we think of mean of difference is 1 inch (which is what we got
from the sample)

*For me writing the t-statistic exclaims the extremeness, but I am not
sure how to write it as I have to explain a normal distribution adn
then a t-statistic. What is expected here? I still used a lot of
jargon here!*

For 6, we think of <5% in our case it is ~0%. 

For 7, we think of mean of difference in father and son's height as 0
for the entire India (population)

For 8, we think of a sample where the father's drink a potion that
decreases their height by an inch approximately, after their son's are
born. i.e., chance of this sample being picked <5%.

For 9, we think that the mean of difference in father's and son's
height is != 0.

**Claims**

> p-value is the probability of obtaining a mean that is >= obtained
> sample mean.

*It is a definition. I don't see this as a claim!*

> if P-value is small then either H0 is true and we have observed a
> rare event

Let's say we have knowledge that the fathers in the sample drank
a potion before coming to the study that made them 1inch shorter. And
that in all other cases are of the same height.

In this case, p-value is 0 for sample with mean 'difference in heights
of father and son'. In this case, the father's height is same as son's
height but we have observed 1inch height difference in this sample.


> if P-value is small then H0 is false

The p-value is ~0 (to the 12th digit), in this case, we say that there
is no way the father's and Son's height could be the same for the
whole world.


## Three confidence intervals of linear regression

There are three different concepts:

1. The confidence intervals for the coefficients β0 & β1 in the the
linear model.

2. The confidence interval for the regression line at a
particular value x_k. 

3.​The prediction interval for a predicted value $$ when x=x_k

Confidence intervals for the coefficients in the model (page 47-49):
can be used for hypothesis testing, to see whether a relationship
between x and y is likely or not.

Predict a y-value in x_k by y^=β^0+β^1∗xk

Confidence interval for the regression line (page 49-51):the predicted
value lies on the regression line and is the mean of possible
y-values. Because of the random nature of your observations the
regression line has a confidence interval for each x_kx k ​ . The
intervals lie as a band around the regression line and the width
varies with x. You can see the confidence interval for the regression
line as the confidence interval for the mean of y (\mu_yμ y ​ ).

Prediction interval (page 49-51): the prediction interval is like the confidence interval, but now for the value of y (and not for it's mean). It also varies with x, and the band around the regression line is wider. The "real value" for y, given x= x_kx=x 
k
​	 , lies within the prediction interval with ..% confidence.

I guess in most situations people will be interested in the prediction interval

*this is going to be mighty ass painful! but let's go!*

*I don't know what confi Intervals stand for*
 
In the other case I see a bell cureve, I see a mean get it!

For 1, we think of a weight that is 5 times the wafer stage (12kg), so
that if the wafer stage moves 1mm the weight moves 0.2mm in the
opposite direction. In this case this weight comes from the Lorentz
actuators.

For 2, we think of the "X beam" having only the Lorentz actuators and
no extra material 

For 3, we think of the Lorentz actuator which consists of
magnet, placed on iron as shown below (without the coil).

![lorentz](./images/images-DP-3/lorentz.png)

For 4, we think of the Lorentz actuators that move the wafer stage in
X and Y directions.

For 5, we think of the Y stage where in addition to the actuators, we
also need 300kg's of mass, where as in the X stage just the actuators
and their resultant weight of 60kg is "good enough".

For 6: If the stage moves at 50m/s^2 for 10mm, it creates a force of
600N in the opposite direction(newton's law). The X-beam (60kg
actuator) will move only 2mm, as a result of this force. This movement
of the X-beam will not exceed the volume limits given (5mm). Hence no
separate structure is necessary.

For 7, we think of 


![lorentz](./images/images-DP-3/lorentz.png) 


For 8 & 8a, we think of of a bolt running through the magnet into the yoke,
forcing them to stay together.

For 9, we think of the setup with bolts and without bolts and check
the ""force band"" for a ""given current""! this has an "effect" on
the "contro"

*This is not an example, I get it! An example would be an actual
analysis!*

For 10, we think of the bolted magnets to the yoke!

For 11, I don't know what is to be checked, how to know if it has
influence or not!

For 12, when there are two opposite magnets facing each other, there
is a magnetic field. In the case of the actuators we are using it is
about some "X" Tesla!

For 13, I don't have an example...


For 14, no example, to suggest what magnetic field changes are
expected...

For 15, plastic small? how will this solve the problem?

Any more of this is a waste of time. It is not my forte!

11 12 The function is of the Magnet Yokes are primary
for the stator part of the wafer carrier actuators, 13 secondly as a
balance mass in X direction.  14 For a good balance mass function, the
driving forces into X beam need to be in the CoM in both Z as Y 15
direction. This was one of the reasons for connecting one X motor to
the front pillars and one X motor to 16 the rear pillar.  17 18 The
connection of the X-beam to the Y connecting bodies is done via linear
bearings.  19 This linear bearings give the X-beam the freedom to move
in X direction while giving stiffness towards 20 the X-beam in the
other 5 DoF’s.  21 22 The total moving mass of the X-beam is budgeted
as 4x the Wafer Carrier mass = 4 x 12 kg = 48 kg.

For 1, we think of the fuel consumption data along with 10 aspects of
automobile design aka, mtcars. 

For 2, linear regression fit

For 3, we think of a straight line passing through the plot of miles
per gallon vs weight of the car so as to produce least error between
the line and the actual values.

	mpg = beta0 + beta1 *weight
	

This way for a given weight you can guess what will be the miles per
gallon.

For 4, we think of weight. For a given weight we guess the mpg.


For 5, we think of mpg, for a given weight we guess the mpg.


For 8, we think of x0=mean(weight)=1.6

For 7, we think of the point on the regression line at the mean

For 6, we think of band about which the point in 7 varies

       fit      lwr      upr
	1 20.09062 18.99098 21.19027

For 9, we think of the lwr value.


**Claims**

None. It was all questions as far as I could see!

For 1, we think of a linear regressor between breath mint usage and
pulmonary function, such that 90% of the points lie within 2% in the Y
of the estimated linear regressor. More like error = something also
the following cases!

For 2, we think of a 60 degree line plot of breath mint usage in X and
pulmonary function in Y, i.e., if breath mint is x0, then y0 = beta0 +
beta1*x0. (linear relationship)

For 3, we think of mints per day

For 4, we think FEV measurement

For 5, It could be that mints per day is a direct result of smoking
which could be the actual reason for the measured FEV, for example!

For 6&7, you would guess, think or "naturally believe" as "probable
cause"

For 8, People who smoke more than 10 cigarettes a day

For 9, I am not even sure this should be highlighted!

*I want to leave out all the bullshit and read just the main words,
like leave out tend to use, you would say and all that!*

For 10, we think of breathmints_smokers-breathmints_nonsmokers>3

For 11, we think of people who smoke less than 1 cigarette per day. 

For 12, there is a regressor line with y varying by 2%

For 13, FEV

For 14, Smokers taking in "more" breath mints that average joes!

For 15, we think of the regression line between breathmint usage and
FEV and conclude wrongly that breathmints cause FEV.


**Claims**
Moving on?

> function)[9] (than smoking non-breath mint users)[10], I'd be (more
> inclined)[11] to (believe you)[12]'.

For 1, no examples are needed.

For 2, we think of a regression where the effects of smoking is
removed from the data. For example, if we use the data for non-smokers
only who use and don't use then it gives more confidence that the
hypothesis initially mentioned is right!

For 3, yeah! what is likely? most probably! Having been trained a bit
in statistics, we know that correlation is not everything. the effect
of other possible regressors needs to be removed!

But what does likely mean? No idea!

For 4, doesn't need an example as well

For 5, we think of FEV levels that are "low"

For 6, we think of non smoking breath mint users,  having an few of
"low" and the non smoking non-breath mint users > than "low".

For 7, doesn't need an example

For 8, we think of the two arguments

- smoking breath mint users....
- non-smoking breath mint users!

For 9, we think of "low"

For 10, we think of > "low"

For 11, we think of "pursuing this line of thinking" that breath
mints actually cause lung issues.

For pursuing, I would think of checking if there are other variables
such as people flossing or not, contributing to the use of breath
mints.

You are never a 100% sure. Atleast smoking seems not to cause the
issue, but flossing could, so we pursue that line of thinking i.e.,
look at the data on flossing peop


Check if people who floss and take breath mints and bla bla bla... I
understand flossing has nothing to do with lung function or whatever!


For 12, we think of the same think, pursue other variables and right
now I don't fully understand the effect of keeping one variable and
removing the other. Removing all variables sounds like  a plan as lm
does! but of course bcaffo said you need to play with the variables 




* In other words, to even consider my results, I would have to
  demonstrate that they hold while holding smoking status fixed.
## Summary of by understanding of 80k

So at this point having learnt new techniques to check my
understanding, I put it to test on text that I have written
earlier. One such text is the 22k article I wrote based on the english
and some impact calculations I did! God help the lack of study level
data!

For 1, I think of the time I did "research" or "read through articles"
"based on which" I form my "opinion".  

I mean why do you think bla bla bla. Is it really important I talk
abut "i think"? if I just talked about 2 and 3, I don't skip anything
important like "if DW is "better" SE"

Yea no more I think words shall be respected. We move on I guess.

For 2, I think of number of lives saved, which is the only goddamn
thing we care about!

For 3, we think of how SE, can make a lot of money (working at
Snapchat paying 300k$), but does not get you skills like in
statistics or management, as compared to say working in DS. Statistics
is almost life here. Critical thinkging aka hypothesis and rejecting
is the norm here. Scientific way is the shizz here!

For 2a, we think of working at Givewell at a starters position like an
	analyst and create an impact of 500 to 1.4k lives

For 3a, we think of working in google for as an SE writing python/C
code for their softwares like their search engine, for a salary of
200k$ within the next 5 years.

For 4, I think of SE as described the previous example.

For 5, we think of ("skills in statistics")[] and ("researching")[]

For 5a, like listed in the GiveWell website, cause that's what they
are looking for!

For 5b, like listed in GiveWell website

For 6, we think of "stuff" listed in GiveWell website!

For 7, we think of barely writing 5 lines of code without referring to
stackoverflow, barely knowing python and just starting with R, lack of
ability to write software?

For 9,  I think of within my lifetime

For 10, I think of being a researcher

For 11, we think of MIRI

**Claims**

> (DW)[2] (potential)[3] with (SE)[4] is (very poor)[5].


For 2, we think of working at GiveWell

For 3, we think if # of lives saved by getting a job at GiveWell is
~1000

For 4, we think of working at google making softwares like google maps

For 5, we think of working at google on google maps, without learning
any statistics that is very important for GiveWell.

An example of the claim is: Number of lives saved by getting a job at
GiveWell, as a result of working at google on building google maps,
does not give us the knowledge in statistics (causal inference,
limitations of experimental methods), which could in turn get us a job
at GiveWell which could save about "1000 lives"" over my lifetime.

> (It)[1] does not give me (skills)[2] in (statistics)[3] 

For 1, we think of working in C and python building the platform for
google maps

For 2, we think of knowing when to use what variables to model miles
per gallon vs number of cylinders, for example, In the mtcars dataset,
we want to look at outcome miles per gallon and the influence of the
predictor: number of cylinders. If you don't use any of the other
variables in your model, you get a slope of

Why not start with claims and then identify the roots, so that it
gives you a heads up on what you need to give examples for, otherwise
it feels like pandian is flying in the dark!

## Mechanics

If the trajectory ui of the particle is such that the effectively applied forces produce
no virtual work for any virtual displacement compatible with the constraints, the
equilibrium is then satisfied.

The virtual work of the forces effectively applied onto a system of particles is zero
with respect to any kinematically compatible virtual displacement if and only if
the system is in dynamic equilibrium.

For [3], we think of the time it takes to get the car out, the time it

your destination.

**Claim**: [1] rejects [4], for [3].

**Example**: Mr. T doesn't say where he has a problem with estimates,
instead he just says, that holistically, it seems unlkely.

**Claim**: [2] is [4].

Here you either find one other tool that is "more powerful" than
analysis or you give an example of how it is "quite powerful".

For example, at my work, we are building a machine and the cost of
goods is of high priority. Here we have an excel sheet showing the
different costs of the each part. We look at which has the highest
costs and see how we can reduce them for example.

If I am trying to dispute most powerful, then I would go with Eliezers
example on how to make predictions about future based on the
past. Eliezer says, estimation of time money cost are all done based
on previous costs! Which is one part of it. Breaking down seems to be
a part of it. 

So loose claim!

**Claim**: either not used [4] to test/[5], or not willing to discuss [6].

*I don't know how to test for this!*

**Fun Fact**: I wrote a comment on this blog, a [2] years back, of
course I didn't understand shit! Let's see!

**Claim**: If [1], [2] and [3], but only [4] \* [5], then [6]

**Question**: bla bla bla ____

**Split** 

For [2], we think each year we are able to live after death is worth 100k
<span>$</span>/yr now.

That's a lot???

For [3]: *This is my interpretation from the shit that I think is his
writing*

Year 1 after being revived = 100k, year 2 = 98k and so on...

For 4, assuming a 5% chance of revival, does he mean:

year 1 5% of 100k, year 2 = 5% of 98k or does he mean  :

year 1 100k, year 2 = 5% of 2k = 100 <span>$</span> so life in year 2
is 100k -100. I don't think this is true. But maybe he means sumpin
else

For [5], we think of 100k/2

For [6], 

Ok, So I did, 100k\*1/2\*5% = 2500<span>$</span>. If you reduce 2% for
every year lived after being revived, we get for the first year 2500,
next year 2401, and the next 2352 and so on, in the 146th year, we get
130 <span>$</span>. If you add this all up, you get 116k
<span>$</span>. Close to 125k (maybe consudering an infinite
series). For 276 years you get 122k. 

So I conclude that he is right. 

P.S
I don't think I understood him because of splitting but more by
chance, as I didn't ponder enough, what he meant and didn't try out
some guess calculations. If I look at what I tried to do I already
seemed to hev a good idea about what was required. I just got confused
with this discounting and how the years should be taken into account!
Anyways, win for Agent!




**Example**: 

**Claim**: [7] is 125k$

**Example**: It's 200k at alcor now!
