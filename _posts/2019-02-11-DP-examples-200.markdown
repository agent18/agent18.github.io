## Mission #5 by an STM

You've described [2] using a lovely concrete example in the [last
post](/DP-CT-examples.html). However, [1] is sorely lacking in examples. What is this
"organizing information"? Or "providing solutions"? That could be
anything from "it's hot today" all the way up to "e = mc^2". Contrast
that to PG's [business plan](http://www.paulgraham.com/vwplan.html) for his startup in 1995:

> OVERVIEW Webgen allows clients to generate web catalogs remotely.
>
> There are several other companies that can generate and serve web
> catalogs. The best known site of this type is Marketplace MCI
> (www.internetmci.com). But while these other sites use their
> generators in-house to build catalogs from materials provided by
> clients, Webgen's generator can be used interactively by anyone with
> a modem and a copy of Netscape. ...

You might want to describe what you're doing in such terms, like
"*generate web catalogs remotely*" or "*used interactively*", so that
it is clear even to an outsider what you're doing.

**Mission #5:** Time to chunk it up. Right now, you are working on
sentences and paragraphs at a time. That is, you get feedback about
your output dimensions after writing the entire paragraph (or God
forbid, the entire essay). The feedback isn't immediate enough
(principle #3 from TiO). In contrast, look at how I narrowed down the
specific phrases [1] and [2] where you gave examples or not.

You need to take passages you feel you don't understand clearly
(perhaps some things you've written yourself about important yet
unclear issues in "rationality" and some outside material about tough
technical problems), mark within parentheses each important phrase
like I did with [1] and [2], check if you've given an example for it,
and if not, rewrite it with a concrete example. If you're not sure if
a phrase is important or not, err in favor of an example. 200
repetitions should be a good start. Soon, you will come to notice
immediately if you are throwing out words without any concrete
example, the way a misspelled word in an editor shows up with red
underlines.

Does it mean that PG and EY will give examples after every phrase? Not
necessarily. But they will have an example in mind as they write. I
suspect that when we say "people don't think clearly", we mean that
their words don't correspond to any concrete example (see: "critical
thinking"). And when your words don't correspond to anything concrete,
you can make them say anything. For a striking example, check out this
philosophical passage that EY tore to pieces:
https://youtu.be/D6peN9LiTWA?t=1067

What was the problem there? The words didn't correspond to any known
piece of reality. They were figments of the poet's imagination, and
yet he thought they described something real. It sounded convincing
even to me. I was like, yeah, maybe we really are fallen people
compared to those wise, brotherly ancients.

How would you and I tackle that? We would stop at the first phrase in
the first sentence: "In the age when life on Earth was full". Ok. Give
me a historical example or empirical evidence for what you mean by
"life on Earth was full". People had AC's? Cars? Long lives? Lots of
sex? (Could be true. Could also be not true. Need empirical
evidence. And if you say you can't get that evidence from millenia
ago... well, that's the whole point! Why are you using as an example
something that you have no real evidence about? End of story then and
there.)

Let's take another example closer to home. "I need to practice
critical thinking and become a master." - Anonymous, 1785 AD. Well,
Mr. Anonymous, what is this "critical thinking" you speak of? Let's
see at least one example (after you've practiced on a bunch of other
sentences).

## Goal and how to do it.

**Goal**: All fluff words (like problem solving, critical thinking)
have to be associated with examples. And we need to do this on 200
phrases.

The first example is given below...

> "(I want to get better at *critical thinking)*"[1]- Anonymous 1795 AD

**P:** I want to get better at "critical thinking". 

**E:** In the article on [scope insensitivity](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity) there is a
lot of discussion about how to design experiments that distinguish the
"prototype-dominated" affect and the warm glow of moral
satisfaction. I don't understand this. There is a whole discussion and
I am finding it hard to wrap my head around it. I'd like to get better
here.

At work, I am having to do quite some "problem solving". By that I
mean I am given a couple of observations (about leak in the Vacuum
Chamber). I need to isolate what is the problem is (is it leaking from
outside? or are these virtual leaks? etc...), I need to design
experiments (pump down the chamber and measure leak) and I need to
convey the results (make a presentation and explain how my diagnosis
is right). This is hard for me, I want to become better here, i.e., I
often find myself banging my head to make sense of what is happening
and presenting it. :)

<!-- **Goal 2:** Not feel bored -->

<!-- Last essay I wrote out loud that there were parts that were boring, -->
<!-- and an STM feels that maybe this was due to the lack of immediate -->
<!-- feedback. We need to get immediate feedback, like am I at a good pace -->
<!-- with this mission? Am I able to find fluff phrases that lack examples? -->
<!-- Am I able to give examples for the fluff phrases? Then and there. -->

<!-- As opposed to the last time, where we looked at the main idea over a -->
<!-- few sentences -->

<!-- But an STM seems to think it was the lack of immediate feedback -->
<!-- as mentions -->

### What is and isn't DP (38)

From [my summary on TIO about 'What is and isn't DP'](/DP-CT-examples.html),

> Sometimes I go to basketball practice and try a few shots from one
> spot. Then I try (some drills in ball handling)[3] to (improve play
> during the game)[2]. I try (multiple variations)[3] 2-3 times each
> and get bored and then play some one-on-ones with someone and feel

**P:** improve play during the game

**E:** So every Sunday I play basketball with my friends. Mostly I suck
and people make fun of it, especially when you make air balls or miss
a silly ass layup when you are so close to the basket. Whilst this is
me, my friends, almost all of them, have very good shooting percentage
and good range from where they can shoot. *I would like to be atleast
as good as them.*

**P:** some drills in ball handling; multiple variations

**E:** I start with shooting from different places randomly (roughly 20
shots), and then try 5 spin moves, and then move on to left handed
layups

**P:** Hopefully gets me to amazing levels

**E:** amazing levels like that of my peers (in a year or two)

**P:** "practiced" with golf balls

**E:** The author hit a few balls and picked one of 1000 reasons why he
didn't hit the ball "right", then believed he was practicing for
it. He then got distracted to another reason he didn't hit the ball
"right". In the end he hit about a few hundred balls and felt happy
that he was getting better.

**P:** this will do jack shit to your performance

**E:** You will NEVER be better than your peers.

**P:** designed specifically to improve performance

**E:** You want to be a better basket ball player. How do you do that? You
first need to identify spaces where you suck, example, shooting, lay
ups, spin moves, passing, court vision, team playing etc... Lets for
now say we want to improve shooting, we need to design an activity
that will specifically improve that. We saw earlier how I had designed
an activity to improve shooting. I shot from random places, and did
less than 20 shots and moved on to something else. That is surely
designed by me but not to improve performance. Instead I should shoot
100 shots from similar spots. Or practice until I get the ball in a
100 times. There is a huge body of knowledge about the mechanics, the
form and the way to do the practice, which is available to us to
improve our skills.

**P:** it can be repeated a lot

**E:** The pathetic practice I had designed earlier seriously missed out
on this. I shot 20 times from different places. Instead I should have shot
20-100 times from the same place over and over again.

**P:** feedback on results is continuously available

**E:** When I am practicing shooting, I look at the parameter of shooting
percentage and log it every week as I practice. So I know if I am
getting better or if I still suck, so I can take some additional steps
to keep improving. In addition I train with a friend who gives me
critical feedback, laughs at me when I suck. Furthermore, on game
nights you see if practice is helping you or not.

**P:** it's highly demanding mentally

**E:** It is quite a mental load to practice. You are physically tired and
you still need to keep grinding. Yesterday I was practicing this spin
move and wanted to do it 20 times. By the 10th time, I felt like I
wanted to stop, but I needed to keep grinding. So I had to push myself
to do more.

**E2:** I was practicing some shooting and I was sucking so hard, but I
still needed to keep grinding over all the negativity. I have put in
so much hard work over the last many weeks and the extent to which I
sucked was incredible, but I still need to grind. I was tired, my arms
couldn't do it and I forced myself to do those 100 shots from close to
the 3-point-line anyways. 

**P:** activity is purely intellectual

**E:** "such as chess or business-related activities"

**P:** activity is heavily physical

**E:** "Sports"

**P:** It isn't much fun

**E:** Shizuka Arakawa, gold medal in figure skating, had fallen on ice
with her derriere atleast 20000 times. It did get her the gold medal
after years and years of practice though.

> aspect)[7].

**P:** sharply defined elements that need improvement

**E:** shooting 3 pointers, or delivering spin moves,

**P:** work on them intently

**E:** [Kobe Bryant the legend](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/kobe-bryant-story-jay-williams-playoff-workout/2/) who quits practicing only [after he
makes 400 shots](https://www.businessinsider.nl/kobe-bryant-insane-work-ethic-2013-8/?international=true&r=US) (around 3 hrs of only shooting). Legend! 

**E2:** Jerry Rice working out all day during the off season to improve
his explosiveness and precision in running patterns

**P:** they stretch your current abilities [4]

**E:** Jerry Rice's off-season workout was known for being extremely
strenuous and he was the only one who could perform it. 

**P:** see a couple of issues and isolate each one of them

**E:** Benjamin Franklin understood from his father that his work
stinks. His father pointed out a few of his flaws. One of the issues
was that he had poor vocabulary, so he designed his practice just for
that. Another practice for organization of the prose etc...

**E2:** 

> Not being the fastest receiver in the league turned out not to
> matter. He (Jerry Rice) became famous for the precision of his
> patterns. His weight training gave him tremendous strength. His
> trail running gave him control so he could change directions
> suddenly without signaling his move. - TIO chapter 4

**P:** work on them

**E:** BF found the best work, made notes on it, a few days later he would
make his own version and compare it to original. 

**P:** seen sufficient improvement before moving on to the next aspect [7]

**E:** In basketball, currently I would be happy if I reached 60%
shooting percentage every week in practice before adding other aspects
to my practice, such as shooting when there is a defender
etc... 

**E2:** You master the scales while learning piano before moving on to
things like trill, jumping octaves.

**P:** the author suggests to atleast give it (getting feedback from the
teacher) another thought

**E:** Ben Franklin's teacher was the writings of Spectator, some work
that is clearly of a higher class than what he was capable of doing.

**E2:** All sportsmen have coaches

**P:** While learning it is good to be in the zone where we are just beyond our
comfort zone; which makes us stretch our abilities; it is quite
motivating instead of being a daunting task to approach...

**E:** I can easily bike with an average-heart-rate (AHR) of 161bpm over
20 mins. If I stick to that every day there will be no improvement. I
need to push myself to a much higher AHR. 175 bpm is too hard, so much
so that the I am crying every minute and it becomes so repulsive to
pick up such a task later. On the other hand 165bpm is just outside my
comfort zone and is challenging enough. If I really wanted to train to
be the best of the best of the best, I should be going for 175bpm, but
it drastically tones down the motivation and it becomes such a
daunting task especially after surviving a grueling weight training
workout.

>

**P:** Isolation of the specific space where you need to improve is key

**E:** One of the important aspects of "critical thinking" is to see all
words as clear cut examples and not as vague sentences. Identifying
where examples are needed and providing them is the skill

**P:** followed by a lot of repetition

**E:** identifying where examples are needed and providing them for ~200
phrases, like I am doing now.

**P:** to see progress and get feedback

**E:** If you are able to lift more weight the next time you go to the gym
you see progress, the feedback is that you are getting better.

**P:** You will stop getting any better and stop caring about the end

**E:** If you don't get better at the gym, then you start to question what
you are doing here, if this is really for you etc... Will you ever be
able to lift 100kg? I had such a slump a few weeks back and I am
trying to do things that will get me over that slump, like eating
properly and training harder.

**P:** Feedback is extremely crucial to feel motivated

**E:** I mainly care about the Basketball I play on Sunday. Based on how I
suck and where all I suck I feel the motivation to come back every
Saturday and grind. This week I sucked so hard I want to up my
practice like that of the [Kobe Bryant the legend](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/kobe-bryant-story-jay-williams-playoff-workout/2/).

There was a time when for three weeks straight I didn't really get to
play the Sunday games, I am sure I contemplated not going to train on
Saturdays during those weeks. I was like, "I mean whats the point of
going and grinding". But I didn't have problems going to practice
this Saturday, nor with last Saturday. :)

**P:** Sometimes results might need interpretation

**E:** Its easy to fool yourself that you played "well" today. If you
scored the last basket, you usually feel good. For a better
understanding of how well you actually performed, you need to look at
some sort of statistics like how many points you scored per game or
what was your field goal percentage or even compliments from your
peers ( #gaining-peoples-respect!)

**P:** trusting your own judgment might not really be the best way to go
about it

**E:** "Is the blog post clear to a new reader? Will people get the main
idea? Is it organized well? Paul Graham for example, appears to take
this very seriously. Before he publishes a post, he runs atleast a few
iterations of getting feedback from his friends followed by correction
before publishing it." #PG

**P:** improving writing

**E:** Looking at better-text in comparison to your work and trying to
imitate it; using the [Benjamin Franklin method](http://pradeep90.github.io/ben-franklin-practice.html).

**P:** I suck at writing

**E:** I make lot of grammatical errors and missing words, e.g., [my post on the
"purpose of life"](/Answers-finale.html).

**P:** First I would need to identify good sentences and maybe try to
emulate them in other works consciously.

**E:** Benjamin Franklin identified the Spectator as superior work and
used it to improve his writing.

**P:** repulsion to that activity is huge

**E:** Today as I am making this exercise, it is hard. Generating examples
of all kinds, knowing that I might not really make the goal of 200,
and pushing myself to still make it, is all the strain mentally, and I
want to let go of it.

**P:** it will distinguish you all the more from the rest

**E:** Aamir Khan for a movie makes a [ridiculous transformation in short
time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aVw1gZ9Ncg). It was not easy or fun for him as you can see from the
video. He is constantly made to push beyond what he is capable of. He
struggles with doing it everyday, but pushes himself anyway. His
willingness, the mental struggle he had to go through to do what he
did distinguishes him all the more from the rest; just like Jerry
Rice. How many Jerry Rice's and Aamir Khan's do we know of?

**P:** whether physical or not

**E:** Bodybuilding or playing the piano or [improving writing](http://pradeep90.github.io/)

**P:** drain out our mental energy

**E:** While writing my [first DP post](/Deliberate-Practice-case-study.html) I say this:

> Well, I remember the day when I started writing it all out. After

### Becoming a critic of your thinking (5)

From [criticalthinking.org](http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/becoming-a-critic-of-your-thinking/478),

> There is (nothing more practical than sound thinking)[1]. No matter

There is way too much vagueness in this paragraph and the coming
paragraphs. Oh my! especially for a website titled "critical thinking".

**P:** Nothing more practical than sound thinking

**E:** If engaging in drama consumes your mind, and does not allow you to
focus on things, you should stay away from drama, even if it means
apologizing to a superior when it not your fault; as your priority is
to squash the beef and move on with other important things.

**P:** better off if your thinking is skilled; good thinking pays off

**E:** Skilled thinking can come up with "right answers" for questions
like, "should we marry?", or "Should we freeze ourselves"

**P:** Poor thinking

**E:** I was moving from one house to another, and in an attempt to save
400 euros I brought self some major stress over the entire month. I
didn't know how to equate money to time, I still struggle with the
idea.

I sometimes end up wasting hours and hours, just so I can save a few
10's of euros. I was buying a phone recently and spent the entire day
trading off different phones, when I could be doing a week of courses
from my Data Science course, and keep moving ahead. A phone is
250€. In the worst case if I bought a bad phone I could return it or
buy a new one in a year. I was trying to make the best decision and
guess what, the phone still sucks, its not good enough. Now I want to
return this phone and buy another one which is even more
pricy. #GreatThinkingNot. Lack of ability to realize what is important
and how to trade off money is one example of my poor thinking. Some of
the realization is in hindsight, but I am about to do it again :(

**P:** inevitably causes problems, wastes time and energy, engenders
frustration and pain

**E:** Once I was expected to inform if the Vacuum chamber was able to go
to low pressures. I did some experiments and saw that the in some
cases it went to the expected low pressures and in other cases the
leak was too high. I was expected to present this, along with why I
think it was happening, how to verify my claim and also propose
solutions for the reducing the leak. So I looked at the observations
and failed to tell a convincing story (logical) about why we were
observing certain phenomenon. I felt quite confused while making the
presentation even, and naturally it showed in the review.

I think I will be dead before I finish this. I stop here. This is too
hard or impossible. So many words meaning the same freaking thing.

### Technical writing (30)

Excerpts from the dynamics paper I wrote long back.

**P:** mechanical components that are subjected to dynamic loading in
their regular operation

**E:** typically parts moving at very high speeds such as parts of the IC
engine (connecting rod, piston), or Gas Turbine components (turbine).

**P:** artificially raising the level of the static load ; unknown
variations of the actual loads

**E:** For instance, lifts and buildings are designed typically with a
factor of safety of 100 over the expected static load of the people
and furniture, accounting for unknown dynamic loads due to earthquakes
or winds etc...

**P:** dynamic component of the total loads are low

**E:** they are low when for instance people jump on a table, or say a
table fan rotating at very low speed. A factor of safety or 2-3 can
easily account for the dynamic component

**P:** not necessarily otherwise

**E:** The connecting rod of an IC engine is such a component where the
factor-of-safety (FOS) method will not work due the coupling between
inertia and mass. If you have more FOS, you will have more mass
leading to larger inertial loads, than what you wanted to compensate
for in the first place.

**P:** upon a kinetostatic model

**E:** The angular velocity of the crank in an IC engine is constant

**P:** incorporates the effects of the mass distribution of the resulting
 designed component on the inertial loads themselves

**E:** Mass distribution changes the inertial loads.  Effects of mass
distribution is taken into account by splitting the connecting rod
into 2 point masses and a varying I section. This mass distribution
has a different effect on the inertial loads as opposed to the
traditional 2 point-masses.

**P:** significant variations

**E:** the mass reducing by 30%, the loads reducing by 50%

**P:** the identification of the loads on the component; their variations,
if any, in the stipulated operating scenarios

**E:** For an IC engine, we look at the torque the engine has to generate
and the forces at the joints (varying with time) of the piston, crank
and connecting rod.

**P:** In many cases, it is not possible to model the loads very
accurately

**E:** With the IC engine, there are 3 main parts, resulting in roughly 10
forces. Solving for these forces is quite hard and computationally
intensive when we have the second order inertia terms. We settle for
lesser accuracy and simplify the model.

**P:** modeling the loads accurately when they vary with time

**E:** If the loads vary with time you have to make atleast another 360 to 720
calculations for the case of the IC engine. 

**P:** it is customary to come up with a design based on the available
knowledge of load

**E:** We set the inertial terms to 0 and this makes computation faster
and straight-forward to get closed form solutions and design the parts.

**P:** This method (FOS method) is not guaranteed to produce the best results

**E:** If you apply this to an IC engine, the parts designed are expected
to break.

**P:** dynamic loads are comparable/greater than the static loads on a
component

**E:** Dynamic loads are greater than static loads in Gas Turbines and IC
engines rotating at greater than 4000 rpm

**P:** over-compensation of the loads

**E:** To account for unknown variations, we take the static loads on a
table, say due to a man sitting on it, and then assume the
maximum load is going to be 3 times the static load and design the
table for that.

**P:** detailed analysis of the mass distribution, strength and loading of
components

**E:** for example using Finite Element Methods

**P:** coupled nature of these

**E:** if you increase mass of the part the inertia increases, if the
inertia increases loads increase, if the loads increase the dimensions
increase/change, which have an effect on the mass

**P:** equivalent system of concentrated masses

**E:** For example the connecting rod is simplified as follows: "One
thirds and two thirds of the mass are lumped at the piston and the
crank end of the connecting rod, respectively."

**P:** true variation of the dynamic forces on the connecting rod, and
their effect on the piston pin

**E:** The FOS method thinks that there is no fatigue loading on the
system within every cycle, where as in reality there is fatigue loading.

**P:** connecting rod is divided into three parts

**E:** "two concentrated end-masses, and distributed central part. The
central part remains rod with linearly varying I-section along its
longitudinal axis"

**P:** a dynamic loading case is decomposed into a series of static
loading cases

**E:** The crank in an IC engine rotates 360 degrees. So for every degree
you can compute the forces as though the system was static

**P:** solving a simple static case repeatedly

**E:** Solving the same set of equations for every degree of rotation of
the crank.

**P:** huge computer models

**E:** "Models using Finite Element Methods": For the IC engine simulation
it could take upto 1 hr on a 8gb ram system per simulation.

**P:** effects of dynamic loading on a mechanical component

**E:** such as the loads experienced by parts of an IC engine.

**P:** kinetostatic analysis model

**E:** crank is assumed to have a constant speed.

**P:** simple and analytical in nature

**E:** We don't need to solve differential equations but solve simple
simultaneous equations

**P:** significantly more accurate

**E:** for example, the static load calculation does not capture the
cyclic loading and overestimates the forces

**P:** existing design scenario reported in literature

**E:** The formulas for stress, used to dimension the piston, connecting
rod and crank, based on loads

**P:** it is expected to produce more realistic results as the analysis
and design modules in each iteration, (are refined further)

**E:** For instance, if the mass distribution of the parts resulting in
better estimates of the inertial load improve, then we should have
more realistic results.

### Article by Paul Graham on writing (16)

From [PG's writing on "Writing, Briefly"](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html),

> I think it's far more important to (write well)[1] than most people
> realize. Writing doesn't just (communicate ideas)[2]; it (generates
> them)[3]. If you're (bad at writing)[4] and don't like to do it,

>

**P:** write well; generates ideas

**E:** Writing that generates ideas and clarifies thought implies that you
are writing well. For example, I was writing an article on my career
choices and found that it didn't make much of a difference to me to
save 600 lives as opposed to 500 lives. I was looking at them like
they were €'s. It was during this writing that discovered for myself
about how wrong I was.

I was constantly worrying myself about how I couldn't save 10k lives
while I was treating the difference between 500 and 600 lives as meh!
It was with this article, when I was writing it, that I understood why
even a 100 lives is nothing short of incredible.

**P:** communicate ideas

**E:** PG writes blogs after blogs to share his ideas with people, ideas
on how to write, how a business plan should look, etc...

**P:** bad at writing

**E:** Writing that does not communicate ideas or generate them would be
considered bad writing. If you look at [this article](/Answers-finale.html) on the
purpose of life you will get an idea of what I am talking about. I
wrote it a while back based on the discussion I had with an STM, but
boy, I had to turn my head away while I was looking at it
recently. It's all over the place, needs some major re-writing.

**P:** 
>(Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can)[1], (rewrite it over and
>over)[2], (cut ~~out~~ everything unnecessary)[3]

E1: For my summary on [Talent Is Overrated](/deliberate-practice.html), I wrote a rough version
in 5 hrs[1] followed by 3 editions of the same text taking 8 hrs, 4
hrs and then 45 mins respectively[2]. The rough version has spelling
mistakes, formatting errors, lots of text dump. I reduced the word
count drastically (30 to 50%) by the final edition [3].

For example...

**Bad version 1** The purpose of life is to save people because that is
what you want to do. Imagine you are walking on the street and see a
baby floating in the water (i.e., a massive chance of dying), wouldn't
you save it?  Now think of a child in Africa who is starving, boy that
mothafreaker is hungry as hell for so 5 days and no one is able to
help him, he is a fucking kid, and here you are deciding which phone
to buy and worrying about it. I was recently starving my ass off and
very much needed food but would have to go through some tasks before
getting to it, imagine being like that every single time. What should
you do with your money again?

**First rewrite**
The purpose of life is to save as many people as possible, in the
present and in the future. The value of life is X, saving nX lives
gets you n times the value.

Imagine the pain of starving. I very badly wanted to eat at 4 pm one
day. but I had to weight-train and then do some strenuous cardio and
then go back somewhere and find my food and heat it up. It was 7pm. I
was pushing every ounce of motivation towards keeping me upright and
finishing my work. A starving child in Africa has to starve more than
often. All you have to do is not eat that chocolate, or not eat
outside and he could eat a glorious meal. How could I be justified in
eating a chocolate while an innocent kid for no fault of his starves.

**Second re-write**

I have 10$ and I have the option to allow an innocent kid far far away
to starve (a kid who has probably been starving for atleast a meal
before) or go to a nice Indian restaurant. The choice is simple in'it?
What should I be doing again?

  

**P:** 
>write in a conversational tone;[4]

**E:** I think this means, write like you talk. The following is an example.

**Just writing**
>Traditionally, such design tasks are handled by artificially raising
>the level of the static load by introducing a factor of safety, which
>is meant to compensate for the unknown variations of the actual
>loads.

Uff!

**Writing like your talking!**
Traditionally such design tasks are handled by artificially raising
the level of the static load, i.e., factor of safety design. This is
expected to compensate for the variations in the actual load.

Much better I think! Ok, So do not write ridiculously long
sentences. Speak what you want to write inside your head and then
write it.

  

**P:**
> develop a nose for bad writing[5], so you can see and fix it in
> yours[6]; imitate writers you like[7];

**E:** An exercise like [this](http://pradeep90.github.io/deliberate-practice.html), "deliberate practice for writing", shows
how to develop a nose for good and bad writing and how to fix it. In
the process you end up imitating the writers you like as you use their
work as reference.

Benjamin Franklin took the Spectator and made notes of it. After a few
days, re-wrote them in his own words, compared his work to the
original, and understood what all he could do better. He focused on
one skill at a time, such as writing-organization, vocabulary
etc... This he did many many times to become "America's first great
man of letters". [5,6,7]

   

**P:** 
> use anaphora to knit sentences together[8]

**E:** DP is hard, DP is repetition, DP is a lot about feedback, DP is painful,
DP is needed, DP is going to make you a legend.


  

**P:** 
> work in fairly big quanta of time[9]

**E:** I don't work on essays or even data science if I have less than 2
hrs to give it. Usually I finish all my work and have like 3-4 hrs
left at the end of the day, which is when I pick up essay writing.

  

**P:** 
> use simple, germanic words[10]; learn to distinguish surprises from
> digressions[11]; learn to recognize the approach of an ending, and
> when one appears, grab it[12].

**E:** I have no idea what germanic words mean [10]. I don't have an example
for [12] either.

In the last essay on [DP](/DP-CT-examples.html), I was following the Benjamin Franklin
method and trying to find out how I compared to an essay written by an
STM. I was writing some final words, when I jumped out of my way to
write about `Unconscious consistency`. It was nice for me to understand
that separately, but it didn't fit in the context and I put it in as a
note. This seems like a digression[11].

In the essay on my [Career-Research](/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html), I was calculating the impact
due to various careers and saw that there was a difference of
sometimes a 100 people, and I didn't pay too much care for it, but
realized while writing further that I was valuing the life of 100
people much much less than what they were worth. This was a surprising
insight[11].

**P:** 
> expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start
> writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong;

**E:** I don't have an example. But I usually don't plan my writing. All
my thinking happens only during writing. So I write, write and write.

### Article by Eliezer Y on Availability (9)

From [EY's blog on Availability Bias](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/R8cpqD3NA4rZxRdQ4/availability),

**P:** judging the frequency or probability of an event, by the ease with
which examples of the event come to mind

**E:** (paraphrasing) " According to a study there was a high correlation
between reporting frequencies in two newspapers and the guess that
murders were more frequent than suicides"

**P:** errors in quantifying the severity of risks, or judging which of
two dangers occurred more frequently

**E:** "subjects thought accidents caused about as many deaths as disease,
but diseases cause about 16 times as many deaths as accident."

**P:** Selective reporting is one major source of availability biases

**E:** "The objective frequency of Bill Gates is 0.00000000015, but you
maybe tempter to compare your life success to his. Conversely, 19% of
the planet lives on less than $1/day, and I doubt that one fifth of

**P:** Using availability seems to give rise to an absurdity bias

**E:** "Burton et. al. (1978) report that when dams and levees are built,
they reduce the frequency of floods, and thus apparently create a
false sense of security, leading to reduced precautions. While

**P:** The wise would extrapolate from memory of small hazards to the
possibility of large hazards

**E:** We recently had a mild earthquake in India. I think what Eliezer is
trying to say is that we should look at understanding the probability
of a bigger earthquake and possibly get an insurance on it as the
damage could bring you to a 0$ bank balance.

**P:** Instead, past experience of small hazards seems to set a perceived
upper bound on risk

**E:** "Building of dams and levees lead to reduced precautions"

**P:** A society well-protected against minor hazards takes no action
against major risks; A society subject to regular minor hazards treats
those minor hazards as an upper bound on the size of the risks

**E:** Burton et. al. (1978) report that when dams and levees are built, 
they reduce the frequency of floods, and thus apparently create a 
false sense of security, leading to reduced precautions.

**P:** Memory is not always a good guide to probabilities in the past, let
alone the future.

**E:** People think suicide is more common than homicide, based on
selective reporting. But that is wrong. When predictions in the past
are already wrong, and if extrapolation of the past is a way to see in
the future, then the future is also going to be wrong.

would pay to save 2000 / 20000 / 200000 migrating birds from
drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered

**P:** This image, or prototype, calls forth some level of emotional
arousal [1]

**E:** Emotional arousal like feeling sad or crying or disturbed mentally.

**P:** As for the scope, it gets tossed out of the window [2]

**E:** "No human can visualize 2000 birds at once, let alone 200000".

**P:** this small amount of affect is added, not multiplied, with the
prototype affect [3]

**E:** Studies show that people pay 80$, 78$ and 88$ when asked about
saving 2k, 20k and 200k birds respectively. Increase in birds
exponentially, causes barely an increase in donations.

**P:** Valuation of prototype [4]

**E:** Value of 2k, 20k, and 200k birds, being in the same order.

**P:** Purchase of moral satisfaction [1]

**E:** "People spend enough money to create a warm glow in themselves, a
sense of having done their duty"

**P:** Level of spending needed to purchase a warm glow depends on
personality and financial situation [2]

**E:** I would easily donate 10$ without really getting into the cause. If
it was Bill Gates he would probably give 100$ or more without thought.

**P:** but it certainly has noting to do with the number of birds [3]

**E:** Donations for 2k, 20k, and 200k birds, being in the same order.

**E:** "if 4500 people were saved out of 11000 people, then the perception
of human deaths is higher, than if 4500 people were saved out of 250k
people."

**P:** if you want to be an effective altruist, you have to think it
through with the part of your brain that processes those unexciting
inky zeroes on paper[1]

**E:** if value of 2k birds as 80$ then 20k birds are valued at 80$*1000

### Article by Paul graham on Schleps Blindness (24)

**P:** great startup ideas

**E:** Dropbox, ASML, Paypal, Tesla (greatness measured by success)

**P:** great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under our noses

**E:** perhaps an NGO that works with the government to provide free or
dirt cheap extensive health care for all in need

**P:** tedious, unpleasant task

**E:** I am discouraged to pursue starting up as there is so much
unpleasant uncertainty, it will probably not happen within my
lifetime; you have to penetrate your vision into the government
SOMEHOW; you need to make deals; you need to followup; there will be
power changes; I need to have the right skill before I take it up
etc...

**E2:** I worked in a company where there were 40 designers sharing one
license for part of software. Not many people used it often but when I
needed it I always had to beg around and ask for it and waste quite
some time. To fix it I would need to talk to a few people who have the
problem, escalate it to the VP of the company and keep following it up
for months before I see any follow up. So, I didn't. I just left it as
I was somehow able to finish my work. Then it happened again. I
escalated it. This time I didn't follow it up though. #schleps

**P:** people dislike schleps

**E:** I guess the one thing that is stopping me from pursuing starting or
joining an NGO to support healthcare for the poor, is all the work
that I need to do, right from my education, to handling uncertainty of
such an initiative (mainly coming from schleps?)

> One of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers about

**P:** the inevitability of schleps

**E:** Buying groceries has schleps (you need to go there, stand in que),
buying groceries online has schleps (you freaking need to be home for
2 hrs to collect it), 

I want to be able to clock hours after hours in the silent room in
the library. But guess what, I need to cook, I need to pack my work in
bags, unfreeze the food for the next day, clean plates, buy the
missing ingredients from stores that close before 10pm. Schleps is
everywhere.

You want to find another house where the roof doesn't creek and is in
the same city of your work? #Schleps. You need to find someone for
your current place, you need to find a new place within the Budget,
you need to spend hours on the website.

Schleps got to be done.

**P:** never shrink from it if it's on the path to something great

**E:** You still need to eat, live in a space of mental peace. So you need
to put in the work of cooking, storing the food and finding a roof
above your head that allows you to sleep on time etc...

> The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much
> of it is unconscious. (Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas

>
> The phenomenon isn't limited to startups. Most people don't

**P:** Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful
schleps

**E:** "Most people don't consciously decide not to be in as good physical
shape as Olympic athletes, for example. Their unconscious mind decides
for them, shrinking from the work involved."

**E2:** I freaking don't go to a phisio but complain to myself for the
last 3-5 months everytime I go to the gym because of
#schleps. Wow. The Schleps though is that I keep a schedule and I hate
it if it gets disturbed, I have to call the phisio during the schedule
("I don't have time you see")

E3: Fat caliper allows to calculate the muscle mass and fat%, my
unconscious has decided *not to give* me this feedback as it is a schlep
that I have to do every Monday night for about 10-15 mins

E4: It helps to stretch leg muscles before and after strenuous
cardio. It is a schlep, and I have schlep blindness.

E5: I suspect not many people donate and it's schlep blindness. Once a
year we have the opportunity to donate 10$ from the company or get
gifts for it instead. A large number of people chose gifts. It appears
that their unconscious has decided for them shrinking from the schlep
(aka, having to forgo a bag of gifts).

**P:** most striking example

**E:** Stripe took the hardest problem (considering schleps), and
solved it despite so many people having the same problem

**P:** Though the idea of fixing payments was right there in plain sight,
they never saw it, because their unconscious mind shrank from the
complications involved.

**E:** "You'd have to make deals with banks. How do you do that? Plus
you're moving money, so you're going to have to deal with fraud, and
people trying to break into your servers. Plus there are probably all
sorts of regulations to comply with. It's a lot more intimidating to
start a startup like this than a recipe site."

**P:** That scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable

**E:** No one made Stripe before and once Stripe came in they had the
whole market to themselves, unlike other startups making recipe sites
at Y combinator, which everyone has already made.

**P:** their intrinsic value

**E:** ??

**P:** their undervalued stocks

**E:** "there is less demand for them from founders", but they are
cash cows

**P:** if you pick up an ambitious idea, you'll have less competition;
this is also true of starting a startup generally

**E:** Stripe had 0 competitors when they started.

SpaceX's by far extremely ambitious with its plans to go to Mars, and
guess what 0 competition.

Tesla is pioneering the way of the future and has only one other
serious competitor

**P:** overcome schlep blindness

**E:** Starting Tesla, Starting Space X, Starting Stripe irrespective of
the schleps

**P:** the most valuable antidote to schlep blindness is probably
ignorance

**E:** If Elon Musk knew the type of problems he would face such as
constant backlash with investors, the uncertainty of the company
existing every single day, constantly being scrutinized by the public
and having to stay at work 24x7 while accelerating the progress of
humanity, he probably wouldn't have started it.(bold claim, please
read with caution)

2 people from Indian Institute of Technology started Ather Energy,
which is similar in concept to Tesla but for India and they are for
bikes, not cars. When the two founders started they didn't have a
strong idea of what all they needed to tackle; how to handle the
problem of charging the vehicles; how to sell the product; are people
going to even buy it; is there a market for it; who is going to fund
such an idea; What about competing with other vehicles etc... Atleast
they were not too concerned with it. All they wanted to do was build
electric vehicles. The city needed a better class of electric vehicles
and they were going to give it. Period.

Initially they wanted to come up with battery swap. The logistical
nightmare it would be, was ridiculous. He had some ideas of tackling
it, like running pilot tests, but was not really worried about
it. Ignorance? I think so. They had no vision of the hurdles they had
to cross to put an e-bike on the market.

**P:** founders grow with problems

**E:** The founders have no previous history of managing anything. Both
were extremely technical people. Today Ather Energy is killing it,
having been backed by some of the biggest giants in the industry,
attempting to revolutionize e-bikes in a country like India. Every
single problem I talked about, they seem to have grown to handle
it. For example, if people need to charge their bikes, they decided to
give them charging stations with quick charging in several
locations. They introduced a bunch of features using smart phones to
locate them and check if the stations are free. They have started this
already in Banglore and are trying to expand to other cities.

**P:** They (young founders) make two mistakes that cancel each other out

**E:** They don't know how much they can grow, but they also don't know
how much they'll need to.


> (Ignorance can't solve everything though)[1]. (Some ideas so

>
> It's too late now to be Stripe, (but there's plenty still broken in

**P:** ignorance can't solve everything though; Some ideas so obviously
entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them; take yourself out of
the picture; what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me

**E:** After the company matured a bit, Ather Energy knew that no one
would come forward to providing charging stations. Without Charging
stations infrastructure, their product was going to fail. [It was a
chicken and egg problem. The infrastructure companies would have to
see enough demand to provide charging stations, and only if there are
enough charging stations, the company making e-bikes could
survive.](https://youtu.be/iecq6vSr-EQ?t=1399) So they decided to take that on as well. Ather Grid.

Ask not what I should solve, ask what problem do I wish someone else
would solve for me! This way you see without the schleps.

**P:** but there's plenty still broken in the world

**E:** For some of the hottest problems look [no further than here](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/)

## Reflection

I am happy about most of the work, except the technical writing. I
constantly felt it was really bad. For example...

> **P:** modeling the loads accurately when they vary with time
>
> **E:** If the loads vary with time you have to make atleast another 360 to 720
> calculations for the case of the IC engine. 
>
> **P:** it is customary to come up with a design based on the available

I know in all these cases atleast there needs some more work from my
side, as I do not explain the connection between the phrase and the
example at all.

I like what I did for schlep blindness, particularly here where I
attempt imho some decent examples:

## Statistics 

**Words:** ~5-6k words not including quotations or other files inserted

**Total:** 29 hrs

**DP:** ~20 hrs
**Re-writing & editing****:** 9 hours

**Day 1:** 3 hrs work and 1.2 hrs break in between 

Lot of yawning, trying to figure out which articles to pick. If I keep
typing then I tend to get bored less. The last one hr was hard. I roughly did about 10 examples an hour. 

**Day 2:** 5 hrs work and 2 hrs break in between

I understood the real task at hand and how overwhelming it was going
to be to do 200 phrases. I realize I am trying to eat more than I can
chew. I come back after basketball (very rare event) to clock another
hour. I feel more serious. I am saying to myself, this is how it
should be, grinding at top speed and not anything slower. IT IS
SUPPOSED TO BE PAINFUL! ONLY THEN YOU ARE MAXING OUT. IT IS NOT
SUPPOSED TO FEEL GOOD. Inshallah! #Indha-vali-puduchurku!

38 phrases done by day 2.

**Day 3:** 6 hrs work and 1.2 hrs break in between

Feeling frustrated that I am unable to come up with examples in some
cases. This is hard bro! 

Wanted to go all the way till 150 somehow but couldn't, got stuck at
100 phrases.

**Day 4:** 7 hrs work and 2 hrs break in between

Went all the way till 150 phrases.

**Day 5:** 8.5 hrs work and 2.5 hrs of break 

As for my last day, I am tired as fuck, I don't have much energy in
me. I know I didn't do all the 200, but I did 170-175. I tried my
best. I am sorry! Cheers!

**Situation:** I had most of the time in the day to work on this as I
don't have to work now. I went to the gym or did cardio in the
evenings on most days. Usually started work by 10:30 am and went on
till the night with other activities such as rest, gym and eating
food.

**On all days I slept for half hour after lunch!** Like hand on the
table and closing my eyes and waking up naturally.
