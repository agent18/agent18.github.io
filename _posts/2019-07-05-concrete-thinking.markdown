## Common failure modes

- **Labels are given but not the definitions nor the examples**

- **Labels and are given definitions but not the examples**

- **Labels and are given examples but not the definitions**

## Claims identified as different failure modes

### 80k

> (Career capital)[1] is (anything that puts you in a better position to

> credentials and runway)[2].

[1] is [2] is not a claim, but I fail to understand [2] as it is of

**Type 1:** Labels but no Definition or examples.

> (Gaining career capital)[3] is (important throughout your career)[4], but
> especially when (you’re young and you have a lot to learn)[5].

**Claims**: [3] is [4].

**Type 1:** Labels but no Definition for [4]. 

Not sure how to "understand" [4].

**Claims**: [3] is important especially when [5].

**Type 1:** Labels but no Definition or examples for "important"

> (The earlier you are in your career)[6], and (the less certain you
> are about what to do in the medium-term)[7], (the more you should
> focus on gaining career capital that’s flexible)[8] i.e. useful in
> many different sectors and career paths.

**Claims**: [6] and [7], then [8].

**Type 1:** Labels but no Definition and no Examples, for [6], [7],
and [8].

How will you test this?

> Some of the (best ways to gain career capital)[9] early on include:

> (Working in any organization which has, or with any people who have,
> a reputation for high performance e.g. top consultancy or technology
> firms, or any work with a great mentor or team.)[10]  (Undertaking certain
> graduate studies, especially applied quantitative subjects like
> economics, computer science and applied mathematics.)[11]  Anything that
> gives you a valuable transferable skill e.g. programming, data
> science, marketing.  Taking opportunities which allow you to achieve
> impressive and socially valuable things e.g. founding an
> organization, doing anything at which you might excel.

**Claims**: [9] is [10]

**Type 3:** Labels and Examples but no definition  for [9].

<!-- I am dying here... I don't know if there is a problem or not. -->

<!-- I just want to say I don't understand the label best ways, aka, not -->
<!-- definition. CC has the world's broadest definition award, literally -->
<!-- anything will fit into it. -->

<!-- Anyways, good luck coming up with a real example. How will I know it -->
<!-- is the best way? Why am I struggling? -->

<!-- So failing by *I don't have definition of label* -->

<!-- Contrast this to saying "you will save max number of lives" -->

> So we’ve seen that (career capital)[] is (important, especially early
> career)[], but what type of career capital should you look to gain?

**Claims**: CC is important, early in career.

**Type 1:** Labels but no Definition and no examples for "important"

> Earlier we saw the example of Kate, who went to work at a

**Claims**: Non-profit jobs often build your skills more slowly (than
for-profit jobs)

**Type 1:** Labels but no Definition or examples for [2].

**Claims**: [1] is [3].

**Type 3:** Labels and Examples but no definition  for the [3]. 

**Example**: "Tara trained and worked as a pharmacist with the Red
Cross. Eventually she realized that she could have a greater impact
elsewhere, but all the specialized knowledge she learned in pharmacy
would no longer be useful. This is common when people choose
specialized courses that are only really relevant to one path."

**Claims**: [1] realize [2] and [3].

**Type 3:** Labels and Examples but no definition for [2] and [3].

**Example**: Topher, who was studying a philosophy
PhD, but realized that he probably wouldn’t get any academic
positions that he was excited to pursue, and so left early and had
to retrain. 

Not going to find lots of examples, but there is atleast one.

**Claims**: [1] is going to [2].

**Type 1:** Labels but no Definition or examples for [2].

**Example**: If [2], implies polls, it appears that Kamala has
overtaken Joe Biden in [two nation wide polls](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/kamala-harris-polls.html).

**Claims**: [4] were [5].

**Type 1:** Labels But No Definition or examples for [5].

Couldn't find examples about how [4] were [5].

**Claims**: [3] praised reputation of [4] who were [5].

**Example**: 

“At least there was some civility. We didn’t agree on much of
anything. We got things done. We got it finished.”---[Rolling
Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/why-did-biden-praise-racist-senator-booker-deblasio-850220/)

**Type 3:** Labels and Examples but no definition for "praised"

All articles seem to think that JB praised those "segregationist"
democrats, but did he though? I don't think so based on the above
example but people seem to loose their shit, and made it trend on all
news channels.

**Claims**: [3] worked with [4], for [6].

**Example**: JB refutes claims that he was opposed to "busing by
educational department". He is not opposed "busing of America"
(whatever that means).

**Type 3:** Labels and Examples but no definition for [6] is available.

Here it is not clear which busing they are talking about.

**Claims**: (That moment)[7a] was [7].

**Example**: The polls seem to be in favor of Kamala Harris

**Type 3:** Labels and Examples but no definition for [7] & [7a] was [7].

<!-- **Claims**: [8]. -->

<!-- **Claims**: [3] was [9]. -->

<!-- **Claims**: [3] was [10]. -->

<!-- **Claims**: [11] failed to [12]. -->

<!-- **Claims**: [13] was made by [14]. -->

<!-- **Claims**: It was [15]. -->

**P.S**

Very hard! I started with plans to do much more (talk about critical
thinking, one example vs many vs 0 etc...), but got only until
the above. By the end of one hr I had nothing and I just had to sleep
or take rest before I continue.

## TODO later

- Give examples for 3 types of failures

- write and see how many claims from old essay writing, YouTube fit in
  these three types of failures.
  
- Why should we work on concrete thinking

- one example vs journal level vs 0 example

- what about reasoning? **Claims**: [9] is [10]

- to what extent to go with giving examples,

	- to the point of being able to ask questions

<!-- ## What is concrete thinking? -->

<!-- We imagine it to be something where we are able to substitute labels -->
<!-- with an example based on a definition. -->

<!-- For example, if we look at the label car with a definition of having 4 -->
<!-- wheels a steering wheels and can seat 4, we think of an alto or a -->
<!-- santro or any of those 4 wheelers outside in the street. This is an -->
<!-- example of concrete thinking. -->

<!-- When Trevor Noah, says "She wiped the floor with Joe Biden" -->

<!-- ... -->
<!-- ... -->
<!-- ... -->


<!-- ## Why 1 example -->

<!-- Test the claim with atleast one example... -->

<!-- **Claims**: Venezuela is fine -->

<!-- **Example**: [Here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-trash/warding-off-hunger-venezuelans-find-meals-in-garbage-bins-idUSKCN1QI503) we see people eating from the trash.  -->

<!-- This claim seems to be not true. -->


<!-- Career Capital -->

<!-- hightech industries have high profits in the recent years! -->

<!-- what about journal papers? -->


<!-- AC -->

<!-- ## Why is it important -->

<!-- ?? Career decision? -->
