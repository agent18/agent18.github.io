## What is expected

We are examining **guided self-help** as a potential intervention for
this year's charity ideas. Guided self-help can be used to target many
different psychiatric disorders or other problems such as chronic
pain. It can involve a variety of therapy techniques; we are most
interested in examining bibliotherapy. Your instructions are as
follows:

1.  Familiarize yourself with **bibliotherapy** as a form of guided
    self-help by reading sources you see as relevant.

2.  Use our informed consideration methodology ([link](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/informed-consideration.html#ICcrucialconsiderations)) to create a
    list of crucial considerations (CC) that you think should be
    examined before recommending this charity idea.

3.  Research the CC you think is most important.

## What is guided-bibliotherapy

**Bibliotherapy (BT)**: Use of books as treatment of mental or
psychological disorders ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotherapy)).

**[Guided BT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550243)**: Bibliotherapy is a form of guided self-help. The
patient works through a structured book, independently from the
doctor. The role of the doctor is to support and motivate the patient
as they continue through the book and to help clarify any questions or
concerns the patient may have.

## CC

**Entry question**: Should we start our own intervention charity based
on bibliotherapy? What are the significant considerations that could
affect the initiation or continuation of the intervention.

1. Is there evidence of **intervention working**? (RCTs or surveys or
   studies)
	   
	   - strength of evidence (RCTs, surveys, studies, interviews)
	   - Sample size
	   - how weak or strong is the evidence (p-value, SMDs etc.)
	   - how robust is BT to variations in illness
	   
2. Is there evidence of the intervention **not working**?
   what are they? Criticism etc...
   
   Is bibliotherapy not well founded (for e.g., how is the material
   chosen)
   
   Are scientists divided on this? how so?
 
3. **Uncertainties**?

   Are there difficulties in reaching people with the intervention?
    
   What sort of people is this supposed for? the 96% including the
   people who don't feel they need help or 50% who think they need
   help (based on [Undertreatment of people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5288082/)).     

4. **Neglectedness**? Resources allocated to this intervention
   already?
   
   Are there things missing like funding or awareness or charities
   that we can improve to reach BT to everybody who can benefit from
   it?
	
   Is someone else performing the intervention? What issues do they
   have? Should we fund them or help them scale up or start a new
   charity?
   
   Would it be possible for a charity to even pick it up? How would
   that look like?

6. **Scale** of impact in DALYs or atleast number of people that could
   potentially be effected by the intervention? (Seems to be CEA and
   probably not CC)

	What sorts of MNSS illnesses is it for (low mood anxiety and
	stress?), how many people can it theoretically help?

	What sort of ages is it for?
	
	What countries would have max impact?
	
	Theoretically possible reach with the intervention (96%)? Is it
    all people with mental illness or just the people who have MNSS
    and are seeking help (50%).
	
7.  What sort of illnesses can it work on?

	How long do the effects last?


The is roughly the order I want to investigate in.

## CC: What is the evidence that the intervention even works?

For this CC research I look up RCTs first to see what I can find. I
started with the wiki file on BTs first and then moved from there to
just goggling key words and looking into the results.

### Wiki main RCT article

This [wiki cited article](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/mental-health-services/powerofwords/patientsbibliotherapy.pdf) seems to try and capture the "feelings of
people" in relation to bibliotherapy by interviewing them. Furthermore
there seems to be little or no analysis on how many people "feel" a
certain way towards BT. Regardless, I do not expect this type of
analysis is able to provide any useful evidence of the working of
BTs. So we move on to the next.

### RCT of Carers with First-episode Psychosis in adjunct

[This paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3796072/) titled, "A Randomized Controlled Trial of
Bibliotherapy for Carers of Young People With First-Episode
Psychosis", presents effects of Problem Solving Bibliotherapy
Intervention (PSBI) vs treatment as usual (TAU) while used as an
adjunct to "gold standard support from specialist early intervention
FEP services in Melbourne, Australia"

**Output dimensions**: "increases
in positive personal experiences";  based on ECI questionnaire.

**Conclusions**: Self-Directed PSBI had more favorable experience of
caring than those receiving TAU over both follow-up time points (6week
--> p=0.016, 16 weeks --> p=0.036).

**Data**: 124 carers; assessed at baseline, 6-week, 16-week follow-up.

**Note:** I am unsure what the ECI questionnaire outputs exactly (new
to this). There seem to be more outputs and given the time it might be
worthwhile to understand the different outputs/sub-cases of ECI and
how they vary with each group. For now I move on.

### RCT somatic symptom disorder and illness anxiety

[This paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/AC44F297D8A660A0D99D0E0DA4370340/S0007125000245455a.pdf/exposurebased_cognitivebehavioural_therapy_via_the_internet_and_as_bibliotherapy_for_somatic_symptom_disorder_and_illness_anxiety_disorder_randomised_controlled_trial.pdf) titled, "Exposure-based cognitive-behavioural therapy
via the internet and as bibliotherapy for somatic symptom disorder and
illness anxiety disorder: randomized controlled trial." presents the
value of ICBTs, U-ICBTs (unguided ICBTs) and U-BTs (unguided BTs)
compared to WL (control).

**Output dimension**: Health Anxiety Inventory

**Conclusion**: Significantly larger proportion of participants in all
treatments were clinically significantly improved compared with those
in the control condition (p=0.0001). Also, there was no significant
difference between the three treatment arms (p=0.46--0.72). 

**Data**: 132 participants; assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment
and 6 month follow-up.

**Note**: I would consider the 'no significant difference in the three
treatment arms' as weak evidence for U-BT's being "similar" in impact
to ICBTs and potentially more cost-effective.

### RCT Chronic pain

[This paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24740527.2019.1678113) titled, "A randomized controlled trial evaluating the
effectiveness of an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)â€“based
bibliotherapy intervention among adults living with chronic pain",
presents 8 week self administered psychological intervention (based on
ACT) with minimal therapeutic contact to manage Chronic pain.

**Output dimension**: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)

**Conclusion**: Significant reduction in pain-related disability for
the ACT self-help group (p=0.0001).

**Data**: 230 individuals; assessed at pretest, posttest and 3 months
post intervention.


### RCT anxiety and depression in adults

[This paper](https://www.dovepress.com/comparative-efficacy-and-acceptability-of-bibliotherapy-for-depression-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-NDT) titled, "Comparative efficacy and acceptability of
bibliotherapy for depression and anxiety disorders in children and
adolescents: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials", presents
a summary of many RCTs pooled in one place. 

**Output dimensions**: They look at two output dimensions, Efficacy
and Acceptability to inform the results of their meta analysis.

**Conclusion**: BT was *statistically more effective* than the control
conditions in reducing symptoms of depression or anxiety (Overall
pooled estimate p=0.006). BT did not have *statistically significant
all-cause-discontinuations (after-treatment)* as compared with the control
(p=0.09).

**Data**: Total patients pooled from all studies 979. Data corresponds
to children less than 18 years of age at the time of enrollment into
study. Length of treatment 4-12 weeks. Info on the different studies
pooled is found [here](https://www.dovepress.com/cr_data/article_fulltext/s152000/152747/img/NDT-152747-T01.png).

**Note about age**: 

- BT vs control in  including adolescent patients --> p=0.02 (significant)
- BT vs control in studies including children --> p:0.18 (Not significant)


### Summary

There seem to be quite a few RCTs on BT. Each RCT that I came across
seems to vary in type of BT, whether BT was solely used or in adjunct,
type of illness addressed, and different forms of measurement (HAI,
BPI etc.) etc...

In all cases the main result seems to be that there is a statistically
significant result in favor of BT. However, there seems to be some
evidence for BT potentially not working with children (as seen in the
last meta-study). Overall BT seems to have potential to improve
lives. 'By how much' is a question I am unable to reflect on now at
this moment (due to time constraints).
