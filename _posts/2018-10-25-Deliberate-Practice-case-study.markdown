## Mission 

> Mission #3: Design and execute a simple deliberate practice routine
> for "expressing an idea clearly and systematically" using the Ben
> Franklin method (as explained in the essay above). 100 input scenarios
> should do the trick. Output dimensions would be (a) providing a
> concrete example (like factorial(3) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 when teaching
> someone about factorial), (b) stating the observations and hypotheses,
> and (c) having the output of one sentence flow as the input of the
> next sentence (e.g., data from my computer goes to my wireless router,
> then from my wireless router to Google's data center, and through
> maybe a few more data centers, before it comes to your router, and
> then to your computer). You are free to use more dimensions. The idea
> is that you take a trouble ticket, make brief notes, later write your
> version from the notes, compare to a better response using the output
> dimensions, and try again. If other TT responses are unavailable, you
> can work with articles that you think were written clearly. 1 week.

## Translation

- design and execute a simple DP routine for "expressing an idea
  clearly and systematically" using the ben Franklin method.
  
  This way you cannot fool anyone (yourself) with words, you got to
  execute it.
  
- output dimensions

	- concrete example, stating obs and hypothesis, having output of
      one sentence flow as input to the next sentence)
	  
## Previously

The last few essays have been about Deliberate Practice, what it is,
and an attempt was made to identify skills and design deliberate
practice for those skills. It was hard! really hard. I didn't really
design anything compared to what I saw in an STM's blog. Fuck me! What
a read it was. That's how my essays need to be. Also that's how my
thinking needs to be. 

Where I failed in designing DP activities was with feedback. It
appears that there are ways to get plenty to feedback (exhibit STM's
blog). And I think I completely missed this block of info from chapter
5, TOI.

To back up a little, a book by the name of 'Talent is overrated'
attempts (and I think succeeds majorly) in providing empirical
evidence on what makes people great. The way to increase skill, the
way to become great at something is by doing "Deliberate Practice".

## Let's go

So take a superior work that "expresses an idea clearly and
systematically". Make notes on meaning of each sentence, rewrite them
in your own words, when done compare with the original. or do as an
STM did, compare with dimensions.

## What type of notes to make

I don't want to make every sentence notes. as that is for a differnt
assignment of writing well as picked up by an STM in his recent
blogpost. 

So how about making notes on paras like few words? The goal is to get
me to express the idea. The idea I think is usually delivered
throughout the essay. 

## expressing an idea clearly and systematically


From Revenge or Grow, an essay to this day I go back to, to re-feel
the emotions I felt, I think the idea was very clear and the solution
was one that I suspect I couldn't have come up with by myself and
hence the respect. I suspect as a direct consequence of this and
experiencing what the author expresses about drama, I try to remove
drama from my life (try), even if it goes to the extent of saying
sorry, cause you want peace, you want to focus on the next big thing,
and not fucking what your colleague said to you. Move on! Biatch!

Again the goal is about expressing an "idea clearly and
systematically"

Anyways don't stress yourself out, just trust in the ben franklin
method and do some hard work.

How big should an idea be? how long before

### Superior example 1: revenge or grow

### rough Notes

- what do you do when people hurt you

- two options: revenge or grow

	- The consequence is some sort of punishment, insult or not doing
      something that he might want

	- it would feel good to deliver an insult or the punishment
	
	- what if your revenge attempt fails
	
	- way ahead practice attacking

	- being eaten from inside
	
	- mind lives for situations like this

	- good luck thinking about other things

	- alternative is to forgive, and move on?
	
	- they will continue to attack you
	
	- how to move on? what does it mean to move on?

	- generate value, enrich your life
	- social life is the only life
	
	- if you don't retaliate people are going to make fun more.
	- quality of life decreases even more.



	
### rewriting

What is the best course of action when someone hurts you? and Why?

People might pick on you, make a lot of people laugh at everything
that you do, not stick up for you in a moment of need, randomly get
angry at you etc... If you are like me then these things would hurt
you. And then you have two options, to make revenge or to grow. 

Taking revenge is about providing some sort of punishment to the
person who wronged you. Say if he insulted you in front of everybody,
then you wait for the right moment and try to insult him back or
somehow seek the upper hand. But what if your revenge attempt fails?

Your life then starts to suck even more. Winning against someone
who has forever practiced only this, is going to be really hard, and
you might want to remember the times you failed when you engaged in
drama. Hmmm! So the way ahead seems to be to deliberately practice
attacking and get better at it. Is that it? Is this the whole picture?
Nope! What happens when someone wrongs you? Introducing, drama.

How do you feel when you are involved in a drama? You constantly think
about it, you are consumed by it. You think of ways of getting back at
the people who wronged you. You run scenarios in your mind where you
are verbally battling with them. You have other things to do, well too
bad, drama is still more important for your brain. If your colleague
came at you hard in front of everyone for a small mistake, drama
starts. The worst thing is you could be waiting for the next
opportunity to bring him down and the back and forth could last until
one of ya'll leave the company. So you would always need to be on your
guard, and all this for what? The great BRAIN is evolved for things
like this. It loves social battles, and it lives for things like
this. The Brain lives for it but doesn't mean you should go along with
it.

So what is the alternative? Forgive, move on, get on with the
important things in your life. Don't engage in drama. But how? The
next time you find yourself in a situation where people laugh at you,
smile and move on, despite all your instincts to retaliate. The next
time your colleague comes at you in anger for a really small mistake
you did in front of everyone -even though he has made similar
mistakes- swallow your pride, say sorry, move on. If this type of
drama extends in a few parts of your life, that is enough to give up
everything important to you. Drama is not worth engaging in due to the
consequences. It consumes you. It eats you alive. Someone gets to live
in your head rent free.

Whether you retaliate or not, people are going to come back for more,
for their own amusement. People are not going to magically change. But
in any case, engaging in drama decreases the quality of your life as
it consumes you and does not allow you to focus on important things in
your life. You need to realize that social life is not the only life
you have. Instead you could focus on creating value, enriching your
life. Work on important problems that need attentions, and gain the
respect from your work, play sports and get better at skills, instead of
by engaging in drama which is more like playing poker with High card.

This took me 2 hrs and 16 mins to write re-edit re-read after having
made notes 2 days back.

### output dimensionbs

This whole comparing thing is going to be really hard to come up with,
as we are talking about something so vague and probably subjective as
"expressing an idea clearly and systematically. Tabooing it might
help. 

I guess when we say expressing an idea clearly and systematically, we
are talking about writing about an idea, exploring it, in a systematic
way. Taboo "systematic". Systematic as in, in an organized way like
and STMs example on revenge or grow. Instead of doing all this, I
could for example start with some output dimensions that an STM has
provided and get some more from criticalthinking.org.

Clarify your thinking
1. state one point at a time
2. elaborate on what you mean
3. give example that connect your thoughts to life experiences
4. give analogies and metaphors to help people connect your ideas to
the things that they already understand (for example, critical
thinking is like an onion, method of cutting it results in
whether your eyes bleed or not)

5. stating the observations and hypothesis
6. having the output of one sentence flow into the other

7. Failing to stay focussed on what is relevant
   - focus on what truly aids in solving the problem.
   - how is what you are saying relevant to the issue?
   - what is the central question? is this relevant? how?
8. failing to consider relevant points
9.  Are assumptions justified?, crucial, consistent 
   Are all reasons justified by the data


### Measure pandian

STM:

ME:

> What is the best course of action when someone hurts you? and Why?
>
> People might pick on you, make a lot of people laugh at everything
> that you do, not stick up for you in a moment of need, randomly get
> angry at you etc... If you are like me then these things would hurt

Rule #1: I think both of us state one point at a time. The main idea
here is that `people get hurt by people around them`. It then follows
on with "there are two options", which is another point seemingly
placed in the end to make a continuation. 1-1.

Rule #2: `people getting hurt` doesn't really need an elaboration I
think. But an STM seems to go a bit deeper than I, into the mechanics
of hurt, wheres I just stop with examples I think. Also, I don't
really elaborate on this word `grow`, not now, but much later into my
essay, whereas an STM does, i.e., "ignoring the injury...". I assume
people should know what it means which is bullshit. Strike for
me. Anyways 1-0.

Rule #3: I think an STM and I do the same with giving examples. 1-1.

Rule #4: I think an STM used 3 `metaphors` with "**hit** you where it
hurts" & "You have two buttons in front of you" and "pushing your
buttons". I don't think I do have any analogies or metaphors to convey
the points better. 1-0.

Rule #5: There are observations in the form of examples of how people
get hurt. Here we are just starting off with proposing an idea and
hence do not find hypotheses I think. 0-0

Rule #6: Output of one sentence flows into the other except for the
last sentence, where an STM as well as I, branch to the next point,
which talks about the two options. 0-0

Rule #7: I think both STM and I stick to not saying anything that is
not relevant to the central point of `getting hurt`.

Rule #8: skip.

Rule #9: There are no assumptions.


An STM:

> Agneepath?  What does social revenge look like? Are we talking about
> going out and causing some grievous harm to the other person?
> Nah. What do you think of doing when someone causes you social harm?
>
> You may snub the other person. You may become non-compliant in
> return when they ask you for something they want. You may insult
> them and make them feel low-status in some way, if you have the
> skill. You screw them when you have the opportunity. Or, if you have

> 
> Games humans play in the social world. In other words, it’s
> punishment time.


ME:

> Taking revenge is about providing some sort of punishment to the
> person who wronged you. Say if he insulted you in front of everybody,
> then you wait for the right moment and try to insult him back or
> somehow seek the upper hand. But what if your revenge attempt fails?

Rule #1: STM and I talk about the one idea `revenge`. 1-1

Rule #2: STM and I perform elaboration of revenge,. 1-1

Rule #3: STM has a couple of general examples we would see in life,
whereas I have just 1 example.

Rule #4: This part is interesting, an STM gives an analogy for social
revenge with this movie 'AgneePath', which is also the heading. He
also uses figures of speeches like "Games humans play in the social
world", which I think is a simile connecting social revenge and
Games (something that we are very familiar about).

Rule #5: There are not really any observations or hypothesis. 0-0

Rule #6: I think both of us have decent flow from one sentence to
another. 1-1

Rule #7: I think both of us stay focused on what is relevant, i.e.,
in this case, we stay focused on the idea of `revenge`. 1-1

Rule #8: I don't think there are other relevant points to consider. 1-1

Rule #9: There are no assumptions and hence no justification for the
assumptions.

STM:

> Your life then starts to suck even more. Winning against someone

Rule #1: central idea is about "failed revenge" . Both stick to the
same theme.

Rule #2: I think both elaborate the same amount. 1-1

Rule #3: I have failed to deliver examples of failed revenge unlike an
STM, who gave examples like, "Maybe it doesn’t hurt them because
you’re not good at delivering snubs." 1-0

Rule #4: STM has his right from his heading which is an analogy in the
form of a figure-of-speech, "tongue is mightier than the sword",
"cutting someone to shreds", "Queen Bee Mr. Popular".
analogies and figures of speeches. 1-0

Rule #5: I don't think any observations and hypothesis are considered
here. 

Rule #6: There seems to be good flow from one sentence to the other,
in the form of questions to the next paragraph in STM's case I
think. It is still vague on how to judge flow from one sentence to the
other. Although in my case I *feel* it is rather a jump when I go from
"Your life then starts to suck even more. Winning against someone who
has forever practiced only this, ..." Instead I think it would be
better if I said something like, "Your life starts to suck even
more. Winning such a revenge attempt might be awesome, but there will
always be those players with years of practice who will tear you
apart...", in an attempt to keep the connections.

Rule #7: I don't think anything said by both an STM and I was
irrelevant. 

Rule #8: I slightly didn't consider what it would be to win a social
battle, I skipped over it. Winning against someone who has practice
might be hard, but I never considered or expressed what it would be to
win. An STM did, although the value in this case might not be much, it
looks like it is a pitfall. I should talk about all cases, not wave it
off with my hand. 1-0

Rule #9: "The most popular members of any social
network have fine-tuned the art of cutting a person to pieces", is an
assumption from an STM's side. This assumption is not crucial, other
than for delivering the point. Anecdotal evidence would suggest what
an STM says. So I guess this justifies the usage of that assumption I
think.

write brief notes on the idea of planning fallacy

- large govt organizations seem to grossly miss the deadlines and even cost
  estimates
  
- This could be due to different reasons, such as govt failures,
  availability or/and cognitive bias
  
- students asked to estimate 50%, 75 % completion but they mostly
  never got it right
  
- planning fallacy is that people think they can plan

- reality will be different

- better estimates by getting 'outside view' instead of 'inside view'
