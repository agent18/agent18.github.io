### Learning about ubuntu

[ppa](https://itsfoss.com/ppa-guide/)

Fixing errors with `sudo apt-get update` --> fixed with `#`

~~so maybe I need to add the new launchpad PPA and remove the old
poppler shit? why is poppler not there? do I need to replace?~~

suggested to remove the ppa as [here](https://itsfoss.com/ppa-guide/) I put a `#` instead. OPencpu
seems to be used for R but I don't know if there is even a point.

You don't need to `apt-get update; apt-get upgrade`. As we use the
`Softwar&Updates` all should already be good [it seems](https://askubuntu.com/questions/362872/is-using-software-updater-the-same-thing-as-running-apt-get-update-and-apt-get-u).

How to install nvidia drivers is [here](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-install-nvidia-driver-latest-proprietary-driver/) and [here](https://askubuntu.com/a/851144/443958) and [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/61396/how-do-i-install-the-nvidia-drivers).

or simply remove those repositories?

What happens when I upgrade? does it update the Nvidia driver?
yes. same as running 

### Checking graphics driver

It's not clear what I MUST have 430 or 390. Now should I just change
to 430? how does that work? Wont I have 2 drivers installed?

Nvidia drivers site: https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/135161/en-us


What is the difference? Who is deciding what shows up on additional
drivers?

Is the driver OS version dependent?

Online support is for 450 but I am afraid to use it?

### question (no answer on stack)


**Goal**

I somehow installed the driver 3 years back and want to check if I
have the latest ones and if they are upgraded.

**Status**

`Additional drivers` in `Software & Updates` shows a bunch of
NVIDIA graphics drivers. And currently `390` has been installed and I
see it working with the processes using the GPU, with:
	
	nvidia-smi

I dont think I have added repos ever, (like [this][1]):

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
    sudo apt update 

I know this because I don't see the `graphics-drivers` PPA's in 

    grep ^ /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*


**Question**

0. When I look in Nvidia website there is a higher proprietary version
[450](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/163238/en-us), based on the official [Nvidia driver finder](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us). When I look in launchpad it says [`430`][2] is the current supported version, but`450`
is not shown in `additional drivers`. Why? What am I missing?

1. I want to go to the latest driver available. Is `390` the latest
   stable release for Ubuntu 16.04? How do I figure this out?
  
2. There are many ways to install `450` (I am afraid of conflicts or my
   system breaking). Which should I prefer now that I have `390` via
   `additional drivers`? 

	- download from [Nvidia site](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/135161/en-us) and install
	- apt-get has it's own install `sudo apt-get nvidia-\*\*450\*\*`,
      once I have the `graphics-drivers` PPA's.
	- add PPAs and install from `additional drivers`

3. Should I uninstall `390` so I can install `450` and if so how? (there is no option in
   `additional drivers` to unselect all options). Is the following ok?
   
		$ sudo apt purge nvidia-390 -y
		$ sudo apt autoremove -y
		$ sudo apt autoclean

4. Should I [disable][3] `secure boot` before installing and enable it afterwards?

**Current Config**

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS & Windows 10 dual boot
- 8 gb ram
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050/PCIe/SSE2

## Fastai cloning and installing with conda  


**What seems to work**:

	conda create --name fastaiclean 

	conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda fastai 
	
	conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda gh
	
	conda install -c conda-forge notebook
	
Yes to all the disclaimers such as additional packages to be installed.
	
	
Based on [this stack answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64056681/5986651): We don't need to install anaconda
package as the miniconda install doesn't seem to require it.
	
	
**Attempt 1** (BIG NO):

[Man page](https://docs.fast.ai/#Installing) instructions:

	conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda fastai gh anaconda


Before doing the above I first created a fastai env which is a clone
of my base `conda create --name fastai --clone base`

Error seems to be some [HTTPS error with Pytorch](https://forums.fast.ai/t/pytorch-installation-in-conda-environment-failing/6703). If I know what all
packages I need to install. That is also good. this can be observed in
here:
https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/environment.yml. these
are dependencies of fastai. `pytorch` is a dependency of fastai.



**Attempt 2 (DIDN't try, but looks like it will work)** as long as you
make a fresh env

But where is python installed? Is it in fastai? **Guy 1**:
https://forums.fast.ai/t/platform-local-server-ubuntu/65851/22


	git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai2
	cd fastai2
	conda env create -f environment.yml
	conda activate fastai2
...

Another guy: https://forums.fast.ai/t/platform-local-server-ubuntu/65851

	conda create --name fastaiv1
	conda activate fastaiv1
	conda install -c pytorch -c fastai fastai
	
	...
	
---by [wgpubs](https://forums.fast.ai/t/pytorch-installation-in-conda-environment-failing/6703/4). 

If you’ve cloned the repo for `fastai` and installed/upgraded to the
latest version of Anaconda:

	cd <into your fastai folder>
	conda env create -n fastai python=3.6 -f environment.yml
	That should give you python 3.6 environment with all the required packages.


**Note about Pip**

### Testing with intro.pynb


``` python
ImportError: IProgress not found. Please update jupyter and ipywidgets. See https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html
```

trying from the [link](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html) above, 

	conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets



**FASTAI works.** Somehow the GPU was not used at all, and what took 1 min
for the lecturer in lesson 1 took me 15 mins (atleast that's what it
said).

**More reasonable testing:**

https://songhuiming.github.io/pages/2019/02/16/install-nvidia-driver-on-ubuntu-install-fastai-and-pytorch/

### Fixing GPU

-  [ ] computer slow fix

Based on this [stack answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/756409/443958)

	sudo swapoff -a
	sudo swapon -a

- [ ] bench mark test to access gpu



- [ ] maybe change libraries to improve speed

### Cuda


What is cuda?

https://tech.amikelive.com/node-731/how-to-properly-install-nvidia-graphics-driver-on-ubuntu-16-04/

Restarting didn't help access the gpu.


Do I need cuda? 

Do I have cuda? from pytorch or something

Does installing cuda use nvidia-smi?


**Testing**

check if pytorch even sees your device
https://chrisalbon.com/deep_learning/pytorch/basics/check_if_pytorch_is_using_gpu/


Pytorch looks  like it is not seeing nvidia.. Need to see what to
do...
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48152674/how-to-check-if-pytorch-is-using-the-gpu



and maybe cuda is not enough, or we can maybe use the right cuda

I still don't know what is stable for ubuntu 16 and abd where to look?


### question on nvidia

Which is the **LATEST STABLE proprietary drivers** for UBUNTU **16.04** and NVIDIA
Geforce **GTX 1050** (4gb)? There are simply too many answers which I have compiled below:

1. **Nvidia site** says [450](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/163238/en-us)(450.66) is the latest for GTX 1050 (not
   ubuntu version specific)

	- download from [Nvidia site](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/135161/en-us) and install
	- apt-get has it's own install `sudo apt-get nvidia-\*\*450\*\*`,
	
2. **Additional drivers** tab in `Software and Updates` only shows version
   `390`
   
   - **Note:** `graphics-drivers` PPA's have not been added yet.
   
3. [**launchpad**](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) says `430` (430.40)
   
    > Current long-lived branch release: `nvidia-430` (430.40) Dropped
	> support for Fermi series
	> (https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4656)
	
4. [**Launchpad**](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) also says old branch for GeForce 10 series (1050) is
   390.129
   
   > Old long-lived branch release: `nvidia-390` (390.129)
   > For GF1xx GPUs use `nvidia-390` (390.129)

5. [Launchpad here](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) shows overview of packages (scroll down).

	Here the version names contain 16.04 for `430`.
	
6. [Ubuntu recommended drivers](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia#NVIDIA_drivers_provided_by_the_Ubuntu_repositories) shows different version for
   ubuntu. If I go by this then only `384` has supported versions for
   16.04 (Xenial Xerus)

These are some ofthe links I looked into:

  [1] --> https://askubuntu.com/a/851144/443958  
  [2] --> https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa

[5] --> https://askubuntu.com/questions/61396/how-do-i-install-the-nvidia-drivers?noredirect=1&lq=1  


### Answer to NVIDIA driver to be used

It also says it is `open source` in my `addtional driver` tab... This
looks like a [bug](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1185924/nvidia-vs-nouveau-drivers).

**Plan**

> The key to success is simply to go with the Additional Drivers tab
> recommendations. The Ubuntu Developers worked really hard to make
> that tab trustworthy and reliable. It only shows options that are
> compatible with your hardware from sources that you already
> subscribe to. After you add the PPA, then go with the Additional
> Drivers tab (#2 / 430). If you encounter problems, downgrade to 410
> or 390. ---[my post on stack](https://askubuntu.com/q/1277947/443958)

  * [ ] Figure out what to do with secure boot
  
  * [ ] uninstall 390 how?
  
  * [ ] plan for issues that may come about
  
  * [ ] install 430. 
  
Inshallah Inshallah

To check which drivers are installed, execute the following command :
`dpkg --get-selections | grep nvidia`

**Uninstall and install**

## stack

I am trying to install [fastai][1] but I don't understand what they are trying to do with `conda install`.

The [man page][1] of `fastai` says:

    conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda fastai gh anaconda

**Does this mean:** the channels to be used are `fastai`, `pytorch` and `anaconda` while the packages to be installed are `fastai`, `gh` and `anaconda` respectively? I think they want to install `pytorch` and `fastai` basically. But they don't even mention `pytorch` package.

`conda install` seems to be done like this:

    conda install -c <package-name>

  [1]: https://github.com/fastai/fastai
  [2]: https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/environment.yml

- If I want to install `pytorch` is it enough to mention the channel alone?

    conda install -c pytorch

- Is this even correct to install `anaconda` with `conda install`? Don't you have `conda install` as a result of installing `anaconda`?

    conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda fastai gh anaconda

If I look at the [yml file][2] for any clues, then I am even more puzzled about what needs to be installed:

> name: fastai 
> channels:
> - fastai
> - pytorch
> - defaults dependencies:
> - fastcore>=1.0.0...
> - pytorch>=1.6.0
