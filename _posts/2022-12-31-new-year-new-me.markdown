## Previously on prison break

In the last many years, I thought life had one purpose.

	Purpose is important purpose is all.
	
Purpose was to dedicate life to Effective Altruism activities. It was
important to have a really large impact. And in that pursuit one
needed to be really good at what he is doing. Everything that came in
the way can go to hell. Everything like parents, needs, friends,
etc. Even motivation, injuries and mental health in theory could go to
hell. That dictated everything.

I was never able to consistently have 12 hr work days (8 hrs work + 4
hr of grinding on skills). If I did then it was a few short weeks. And
everytime it was a struggle for swaraj. And everytime I failed I
blamed my sorry ass for not having that infinite mathivanan that the
greats in EA had. 

Last year ~~unfortunately~~, realized (with the help of an STM) that
I am human. I don't have infinite motivation. and most importantly I
learn't sunting about moral obligation and when it is fulfiled. An
essay about it is [here](/is-10-percent-enough-2.html), but the basic summary is that if you
donate 10% it is enough. You don't have to do more or less. If there
is no schellings point i.e., the 10%, then where do you stop? You
prolly will end up in an eternal guilt cycle bla bla bla.

## Ok so now what?

All my actions were guided by "maximize impact for EA" in the past. So
that meant increasing skill. That meant grinding hours on end on "some
vague skills" that I thought I can improve by doing some actions.

Now that I don't need to "maximize impact for EA", aka "grind hours on
end on becoming better" wtf do I do in life. 

How do I make decisions? What do I do? Life is lacking a certain meaning.

During the fanatic days, everything could go to hell. but now?

This is super exploratory essay, I have nothing to go by!!! 

## What I find enjoyable

Giving 10% should be doable (need to cut back on certain expenses).

climbing, going to the gym, playing basketball. Enjoyable is vague
perhaps. I can actually spend so much time in the gyms and its only
physical limits that put an end to how long and how much time I spend
there. Ideally I would like to 

Once I find time I hope to giving dating a go. as much as an stm
swears by it, i can't keep a straight face and say I can stay away
from women. 

I crave them. I am persuaded literally every moment of the day. It's
just hard to s. I think I need to break this down but for later.

I put a caveat that it has a lot to do with peers and trying to be
better than them, there comes the motivation to grind, to be
better. To earn their respect. 

## but what does sciene say?

It goes without saying, I want to give for the rest of my life and I
have to find a way to keep amused. Working on creating "large impact",
having money to buy the things I need,

There are three types of "happiness" says martin seligman. 
1. increasing positive emotion (social, romantic relationship, lots of
   friends giggling), skills to amplify them
   
   as many pleasures as you can
   learning skills to savor them
   
   heritible ()
   habituates like a bitch (french vanilla icecream)
   not malleable (changeable)
   
   you know it's happening (theres thought and feeling)
   
2. having meaning 

	venerable traditionally
	
	
	know your strenths
	
	useing them to belong to and in the service of something larger
    than you are?	
	
3. having flow, engagement ("time stops for you", "work, parenting,
   love")
   
   work, 
   len is no fun,
   bridge national level
   american exchange


	you can't feel anything? you are one with music, intense
    concentration.
	
	knowing your highest strengths (recrafting life to use just them)
	
	bagger at a shop (social highlight of every customers day)
	
	absorbtion

I suspect the crux is to understand what comes in what. 

Correlationaly we can see that "happy people" would haev money
women. but appreently this skill is heriditary, can't be changed much
and doesn't last.

### Science

1. positive emotions (mindfulness, savory, design a beautiful day,
   gratitude visit, strenghts date and design evening, fun vs philanthropy)
2. meaning
3. flow

Life satisfaction, productivity, health, longetivity is also a
function of peositive emotion, meaning, flow

reliving misery, skills living an happiness 

technology, entertainment and design. 


### Mikes lecture

personal income increased whereas percentage very happy remain the
same
 
Where do we feel really happy? creative, scientist, it was worth doing
despite fame and gave meaning?

Theatres, sports arenas, get concentrated positve emotion, but not the
musician (different reality),

Creating... 

110 bits of info per sec (60bits to p)

doesn't have attention to monitor hunger, identify, 

FILL THE 110 bits...

BUT I CANT DO THAT! 

VERY WELL TRAINED (less than 10 years of technical immersion), begin
to change something that was not there before.

You don't want it to stop, because it's going so well, don't haev to
think, autopilot

you have to feel that you are contributing to something worthwhile


#### How does it feel to be in flow

1. completely involved, focused concentrated
2. ecstasy -being outside reality
3. know what needs to be done and how well we are doing (inner
   clarity)
4. knowing that the activity is doable (skills are adequate to the
   task)
5. A sense of serenity --- no worries about oneself and a feeling of
   growing beyond and boundaries of the ego.
6. Timelessness -- total focus on the present, hours pass by in
   minutes.
7. it's it's own mathivanan, intrinsic motivation.


CHALLENGE High vs Sskill High there is a beautiful diagram omg?


Need to go to arousal before going into flow. and control as well. 

How to get to flow? Nothing changed I guess? anga suthi inga suthi


APATHY --> telivision, bathroom singing (actually negative)

telivision 7-8% could still be in flow (but thats when you really
choose a time to watch something that you are really interested in.)
AKA WEDNSDAY. even watching that ted talk, I was learning so many
things. 

Here I am in the last year, chasing how to become better socially, how
to become better at being funny, doing improv chasing an audience,
when in hind sight jo boy got to be doing sunting else.

and this is the sad part about positive emotions, Its so fucking hard
and depends of fucking others. FUCK THIS SHIT! I have been through
rollercoaster of emotions thanks to some fuckers. Adn I still think
about them,, is this shit all worth it? think rachel... Why
drama... postive emotions has the power of drama... 

I kinda need to write it a bit clear but I kinda despise it. Need to
work on identifying or becoming and designing more in flow state.

How I have been miserable all these days searching for something to
do, but today feels different. I feel greatly about uncovering more of
this. Making a "killer blogpost" and hopefully gaining some likes?

lol, postive emotion I guess. 

It is really hard for me atm to distinguish between all these
different things. Why? cause it's not fully clear how they are
defined. 

**Lets restart writing**

THERE IS HOPE, fucking hell I have hope, I think this is what writing
does or rather being forced to write does. you are forced to generate
ideas. FORCED. It can't fucking happen otherwise, you sit and generate
ideas while writing what ever it may be. 

I wouldn't have done this if not for an stm. Because I am the master
procrastinator enator.
