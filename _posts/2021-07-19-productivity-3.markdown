## My name is Agent18 and am a procrastinator

My brother claims to work 60 hours a week. Alexey Guzey claims to work
80 focused hours a week. Peter Wildeford (previously Hurford) workds
60 hours a week as well.

I work only 32 hours as part of my regular job. I want to do "more" in
my free time, in writing, rationality, statistics, getting into EA,
Data Science etc. I need to be "really good" and am far from it now. I
consider >30 hours of "logged work" as Success [^1].

Even forgiving activities like "working on getting my passport",
"attending team outings", "hanging out with friends for an evening", I
have had a pathetic record in the last few weeks as shown below (in
addition to my regular 32hr job):

| Wknum  | Amount of hours worked |
|--------|------------------------|
| Wk-1\* | 7                      |
| Wk-2   | 12                     |
| Wk-3   | 31                     |
| Wk-4   | 7                      |
| Wk-5   | 20                     |
| Wk-6   | 12                     |
| Wk-7   | 25                     |

\*`Wk` --> refers to current week and `Wk-1` refers to the previous week.

Note: In the last weeks I had to prepare for interviews with Rethink
Priorities, Ikea, and other things which are mainly the reason why I
have those crazy spike of 31 hours. In other cases, I was fedup and
made a commitment to my friend that I will work at any cost. More on
this in the footnote here[^2].

My procrastination has gotten so GOOD (really BAD I mean) that I took
off on Friday afternoon from regular work and did absolutely jack
squat till the end of the day. Most of it was spending my time

## Is it time to commit

In the last 7 weeks, there seems to be "quite some evidence" steering
me towards the fact that committing or the presence of the deadline
causes work to happen. For example in `Wk-3` where I did 31 hrs there
was a very SERIOUS DEADLINE the following week. `Wk-5` where I did 20
hrs (not great but better than the average), was because I was fed up
in the lack of work I did the last weeks and committed to doing X
amount of hours. The sad part is in `Wk-1` I did only 7 hours and
looking at the data suggests that all these 7 hours came from 1 day
(the day before the deadline). After that day i did jack squat.

In the above there are two things. One is the presence of an external
deadline (interview dates) leading to a work hours being done. And the
second is committing by myself, putting money on the line also seems
to "get things done". How "focused" the work was is another
question. Both of them seem to invoke increased "hours clocked".

And perhaps both of them are invoking the same response as Scott
Alexander seems to suggest [Applied Picoeconomics](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NjzBrtvDS4jXi5Krp/applied-picoeconomics?commentId=aTxrGdthcX2FrrdfT) writes,

> On an introspection level, the need to study each day (by virtue of
> his **commitment**) felt exactly like the need to complete a project
> with a **deadline**, or to show up for work when the boss was expecting
> you.

In all these 7 weeks, even in the weeks I did 7 hours, appears to be
out of some form of external deadlines or commitment induced
"deadlines".

In addition, to make the case to commit "stronger", Peter Wildeford
writes in his post, "[How I am Productive](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTHe5oGvdj6T73o4o/how-i-am-productive)", talks about
Beeminder. Paul Cristino aslo does something similar. And here Scott
is seen to talk about commitment and how he got ot book reading for a
month 2 hrs a day and Guzey also has some similar experience and seems
to swear by some form of commitment, either money or other for "high
productivity". (RE-WRITE PROPERLY PLEASE)

Also Paul also Peter also Scott also Guzey

## But There's starting trouble

Great now that I have committed it should be a piece of cake. Let's
go! But wait. Yesterday for exmaple of a day. I started at 18:00 hrs
which is a miracle by itself. It has been so hard to start around that
time. I always procrastinated until 18:30 or 19:00hrs, ALWAYS. After
starting, I held my breadth for exactly 7 minutes and rush to the bed
as I couldn't deal with it. With great difficulty I push myself to get
up and sit at my desk. Luckily the task yesterday was a low-friction
task of writing from scratch where I wrote a lot about personal
experience and didn't care about structure or anything and just was
dumping material from my head into a paper. I can manage that. :) and
I did so with just one session >1 hr.

I tell you, committing is just one part of the issue. The current
task, today for example, I am working on is writing an essay,
generating new ideas and doing 4 hours of that everyday with a
deadline to publish at the end of the week. I started at 18hrs and
after only 13 mins I wanted to go sleep. So I forced myself to sleep
on my desk and then following that I worked for half an hour, and then
took a half hour break and another 40 mins and another half hour
break.  

Unlike a coding assignment--where I am able to work 8-10hours
on both days of the weekend-- there is "plenty of feedback" on if I am
on the right track or not. Here, there is absolutely not. It's a hunch
at best, if I will meet the deadline one week away. I am scratching my
head to pick up some form of content that helps me with some decent
structure for an essay. For some reason I feel very hard to focus,
generate ideas and the weight of having to do 4 more godforsaken hours
of this is not pleasing at all. I make one mistake of taking 1 hr off
and then the penalty is huge that I have to extend to late night to
finish it.

Starting before 18:00 hrs might not even be the issue. Let's say I
commit to it. I mean it's hard but maybe I can just commit to it. But
staying focused calls for something else.

## There is also middle trouble

It's not only the starting but also the remaining period.


- It's boring what to do, its also long, I have 6 more hours to go :(

- big picture stuff might help

- PDCing? does not help? I am unable to close myself to work for 1
  min... I have had that thought so many days when I was lying
  aimlessly on the bed feeling like shit and at the same time doing
  absolutely nothing to come out of it.


- Say what you will I just ocmpleted 3 pomodoros back to back without
  feeling like shit, without having (could be a coincidence),
  
- Say what you will I just completed many sessions at work and for the
  first day felt less worthless. 
  
  I feel like it really reduces the burden of having to do another
  fucking 6 hours. and shortens the burden of doing 2 hours at a
  time..
  
  sometimes you are not just lucky to do coding or play videogames
  where you are engrossed for hours heh?
  
  
  I think what is key is to not take off or set the dangerous
  precedent of breaking the HABIT
  
  I have not done a 2 hr session yesterday. I know some tasks where I
  can do that even 3 hrs, where I am doing DP for example and where I
  am looking for information and puzzling out, I really can do long
  times, without no fucking pomodoro. or even coding for that
  matter. But I see the value of it. I am happy that someone asks to
  me to stop and start. 
  
  For the first time in a few days i have hope, that maybe there is a
  way. I mean how long was I going to be in this realm of
  discomfort. Wont I burn out? and when the greats are claiming to use
  it and guzey especially... There is still will power and all that
  bullshit at hand... Let's not deter. :)

I somehow have it in my head I should work for 1.5 hours or more
continously and that I should just pull my shit together and get it
done. I know that would be great if time flew like that but sometimes
with these really exploratory tasks where I am shooting in the dark,
not sure and don't have enough content to write like Japanese train,
then I am struggling to focus.

I know the 3 mins rule and the 300 word rule and the 1000 word per
hour trick to generate quantity over quality for now. But But But I am
unable to apply it. As Guzey puts it, 

> However, (1) you need to decide to do this spontaneously while
> procrastinating â€“ which is hard


Also at my regular work, recently I made a change to a new team, and I
need to work on things that don't have a deadline, but I need to
"understand it". There are not clear questions to answer. there is a
bit of puzzling to do on what I need to do and how I do
it. Unfortunately all I am doing is counting down the 8 hrs and trying
to complete something. I think I felt like shit as well, and going to
work was really painful even. I think that is why I took off on friday
that I couldn't handle more of this shit, just puzzling out and
puzzling out. I just couldn't grind for 8 hours on some vague stuff. I
really am at a loss of describing it.

## review it

What and when and what to look for and what concrete thing to change?

I see that I feel saturated... What that measn is the lack of ability
to focus on this, writing task. Vague?

## Other things 

reading, waking up at said time with 10s timer ets..

## todo

- write basic content
- re-write every para
- spell check
- footnotes
- upload and check

    but just take it that this is time I actually "seriously" worked
    on something.
