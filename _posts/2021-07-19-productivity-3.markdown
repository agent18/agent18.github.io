## My name is Agent18 and am a procrastinator

For the last several weeks I have been working for 48 hours a week on
average. But there are many people (who I look up to), who are able to
work way more than 48 hours a week. For example, [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/co-working/) claims
to work 80 "focused hours" a week. And [Peter Wildeford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhurford8/)
(previously Peter Hurford) claims to work 60 hours a week.

The 48 hours I work for, is split into a 32 hour regular job (one that
pays the bills) and the rest of the time (16 hours) working on "useful
things" such as blogging, writing, interview prep, deliberate practice
etc. 

There is lot of variation over the weeks in how I spend my time on
those "useful things". (From now on "useful things" shall just be
referred to as work). Even forgoing certain activities during the week
(like "working on getting my passport", "attending team outings",
"hanging out with friends for a full day" etc.), I still have a
pathetic record for hours worked per week (in addition to my regular
32hr job):

| Wknum  | Amount of hours worked |
|--------|------------------------|
| Wk-1\* | 7                      |
| Wk-2   | 12                     |
| Wk-3   | 31                     |
| Wk-4   | 7                      |
| Wk-5   | 20                     |
| Wk-6   | 12                     |
| Wk-7   | 25                     |

\*`Wk` --> refers to current week and `Wk-1` refers to the previous
week.

My procrastination has gotten so GOOD (really BAD I mean) that I took
off last Friday afternoon from regular work and did jack squat till
the end of the day. Most of it was spending my time lying down on my
bed and trying to gather the motivation to get some work done, while
watching something on my phone.

My name is Agent18 and I am a monster procrastinator. With this post I
want to understand what I can do to improve my working hours per week
to >30 hours.

## Is it time to commit?

Two things seem to increase the amount of hours worked per week, 1)
committing explicitly to someone while involving money, and 2) having
an external deadline. For example, in `Wk-5` I did 20 hours per week
(not great but better than the average), because I was fed up by the
lack of work I did in the previous weeks and COMMITTED to doing X
hours per day. In `Wk-3` where I worked for 31 hours, there was a very
SERIOUS DEADLINE as part of an interview. In `Wk-1` where I did only 7
hours, turns out that all these 7 hours came from day 1 of that week,
where I had a (you guessed it) DEADLINE. After that day I did jack
squat that whole week.

To me, commitment seems to be invoking the same feel as that of a
deadline. When I commit to "finishing 4 hours of work today or I have
to pay 20 euros", it feels exactly like a deadline with 20 euros at
stake.

["Productive people" such as Peter Wildeford](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTHe5oGvdj6T73o4o/how-i-am-productive), [Paul Christiano](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4gud47NNqgtsEeEr/my-workflow)
and [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/co-working/) also seem to be suggesting to COMMIT. Paul and
Peter suggest to use Beeminder (an app where you pay up if you don't
complete a task by the end of the day). Alexey seems to be
"committing" in the sense that he schedules a "co-working session with
someone specific", that way he just can't cancel that easily.

I have made commitments. Now what!

## Carrying out a commitment is hard

Committing is just one part of the productivity game. Carrying out a
commitment is riddled with issues. I mean I procrastinate even in the
presence of a commitment (and this has led to me paying up a few times
in the recent past). Just recently, when I committed to working 4
hours a day, I managed to do only 3 of those hours with 2x breaks
which were each 1 hour long. I even had a 1 hour break after working
for just 1 hour. Eventually it costed me money as I didn't meet the
commitment.

I think the tasks I work on don't seem to be helping my cause. For
instance working for 2-3 hours continuously is not a problem with
coding assignments, but it is very hard with such "exploratory" tasks
I have to take-up for writing (e.g., "write an essay on improving
productivity"). The exploratory tasks don't really have an end, but I
usually decide I will spend X hours on it.

And perhaps the longevity of the task doesn't help either. I need to
do the same uncomfortable thing for 4 hours? No way, Jose! I don't
remember signing up for back-to-back weeks of commitment. I usually
sign up for one week and then allow the "habit" to take over from
there. Clearly the "habit" never, "took over from there".

Another issue seems to be my inability to get started early. In theory
starting early would help to finish early, sleep early and wake up
"on-time". But starting early is hard. Many days I get ready at 18:00
hrs to start my work but then decide to do other things like "watch
JUST one YouTube video" or "lie down on the bed JUST for a few minutes"
etc. Arghhh!

Maybe if I just did a few minutes of work or wrote a few 100 words I
would get into the groove and nothing would stop me for those 4
hours. But even on days when I miraculously started at 18:00 hours and
clocked a few minutes, I managed to fail badly. A few days back, I
worked for exactly 7 minutes before giving up and going to bed (for a
full hour).

Once I am in the bed and watching YouTube or engaging in some other
form of procrastination, the only thing that drives me to get back to
work is when I realize how late in the night I am going to have to
work to fulfill my commitment. So if I start at 19:00, at the very
least, I have to work till 12:00 am (assuming a 1 hr break). Sometimes
despite this I procrastinate for even longer. It takes a lot of will
power to metaphorically untie myself from the bed and eventually start
work.

Maybe I should remove the bed out of the equation (at least while
working). In 2018, for this very reason I used to work exclusively in
the library and spent countless hours there after regular work and in
the evenings. I pretty much used my home just to sleep and cook. I
will look further into this, if I am unable to sustain 30 hours in the
coming weeks.

I also use [Leechblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leechblock-ng/blaaajhemilngeeffpbfkdjjoefldkok) to help curb my procrastination. I use the
"block now" function (called Lockdown) to initiate the
blocking. However I wish I could tell Leechblock to block the sites
say 15 minutes from now. Ordinarily it is easier to decide to work at
some point in the future than right now. Nonetheless, Leechblock seems
to only allow me to block sites instantly or at a given time. :(

Now what do we do?

## Enter pomodoro?

There is a technique called [POMODORO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). The idea seems to be to
have a timer (something like [this](https://pomofocus.io/app)), where there is 25 minutes of
work (referred to as Pomodoro) followed by 5 minutes of break where you
do anything other than the task at hand. You "decide" what you are
going to do during the 25 minutes before the pomodoro starts. This goes
on 3-4 times and then you get a 15-30 minute break. And repeat. Every
time you finish a pomodoro, you have an alarm bell to start the break
and an alarm bell for you to get you back to work. During a Pomodoro
all distractions are to be silenced: phones are switched off,
Leechblock on, [Game Face](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/game-face) on, and ear plugs are used as necessary.

I gave it a try. I tried this first at my regular work this week and I
will say that it was one of the most "productive" days so far. The
context is that I joined a new team and needed to "get up to speed"
with the code they had written. I had been really struggling with
getting this done for the last many days. The task somehow was really
not pleasing. The thought of having to work 8 hours for my regular work
on just reading code and "understanding it" sounded dreadful. There
were no clearly defined things to do and no real deadlines, just a
bunch of questions to answer (without any feedback). It got to a point
that, last Friday I had had enough, that I left work mid-day and (here
comes the worst part) procrastinated for the rest of the day.

I have been struggling with keeping my sanity in this new team doing
this type of work for the last 2 weeks. I came across Pomodoro during
the weekend and I had to give it a try. For the first time in days I
felt good. I felt like I got "many things" done and I did finish quite
some chapters. I made a small todo list of the section names I needed
to cover. I picked up one section at a time and finished it in one to
two Pomodoros. I generously took the breaks without feeling
guilty. And the best part is that I ended up getting things done while
feeling sane at the same time. Advantage Pomodoro!

What I like about this is, I have to push through only 25 minutes at a
time. And there is a break right ahead in case I needed it. I think
maybe this was the most significant contribution of pomodoro. And I
continued to slay and slay through the rest of the day. 

---

I really believed at first sight that I would never need any of this
Pomodoro nonsense for my "work after dark". But with how much I was
sucking at work, I decided to give it a try. So far I have been able
to make several 2 hr "continuous Pomodoro sessions", which I didn't
believe was possible with this task with previous techniques
(non-Pomodoro style). And the most important part was that I felt good
again while doing the task and starting the task. I didn't think of
all the hours I had left to do. I am able to approach work in a
friendly way rather than think of it as something that is painful.

I do understand that work done for 4 hours becomes 3 hours and 20
minutes as a result of the breaks. I say it is ok for now. Maybe it is
ok for later even. The goal is to get work done and feel good at the
same time so that I can continue this for a long-long time. Having
said that I don't completely waste the breaks. I use breaks in
different ways, sometimes I just stop writing and walk around thinking
about the task at hand or what is the next thing I should be working
on. Sometimes I do sleep for those 5 minutes with my head on the desk and
sometimes I do look at twitter or YouTube. The nice thing is the
alarm, which so far I have used to immediately drop what I do and get
back to work.

Many reputed people seem to be using the Pomodoro technique as
well. Paul Christiano, an AI researcher who previously worked
in OpenAI, used this technique with 20 minutes work and 3 minutes
break (at least back in 2012). Peter Hurford also suggests the use of
this technique to get into a habit. Alexey Guzey seems to be doing
something very similar to this technique, where he works for 30
minutes and has "check-ins" with his work buddy to discuss what he is
working on next and if is focused enough (and then repeat).

## Measuring the success of POMODORO?

I think I feel generally better about the task at hand when working
the POMODORO way, compared to how I felt when I had to do 4 hours of
work without using the technique. (I know that sounds vague and
un-testable)[^4]. Below is a table with some statistics on this. For
example, Day 1 is a non-Pomodoro day where I clocked 4 hours of work
within 4.75 hours, with one half hour break and two \>1 hour breaks.

| Day | Pomo/~ | Clocked | Total             | >1/2 hr break | 2hr work | >1hr work |
|-----|--------|---------|-------------------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| 1   | No     | 4       | 4.75              | 1             | 0        | 2         |
| 2   | No     | 4       | 5.4               | 3             | 1        | 0         |
| 3   | Yes    | 4       | 4.5               | 1             | 2        | 0         |
| 4   | Yes    | 3       | 3.5               | 1             | 1        | 1         |
| 5   | Yes    | 3       | 3.75              | 1             | 1        | 1         |
| 6   | Yes    | 8       | split through day | 3             | 3        | 1         |

For now I see that with POMODORO there is easily a 2 hour continuous
session happening that day. In fact the first session of all Pomodoro
days was a 2 hour session. I am still having the starting trouble where
I can't start by 18:00 hrs and sometimes it takes a while before I
start, I will fix that with a bit of committing. But so far I think
POMODORO seems to be doing well with allowing me to work long chunks
of time (albeit with a 5 min break every half hour).

I think what would be even more interesting is to see how many
distractions I had in a particular session of Pomodoro and
non-Pomodoro. I will collect such information in the future.

I hope to use Pomodoro for tasks like writing and interview
preparations. Maybe for Data Science tasks as well, I should give it a
try and see how it goes.


## Review

My name is agent18 and I am a procrastinator. My goal is to regularly
clock >30 hours a week on work (not including my regular day job) from
now on. I like several others (Peter, Paul, Alexey, Scott Alexander)
find that commitment is an essential part of getting uncomfortable
things done (especially the "hard ones") until it becomes a habit at
least (not sure how long it takes).

Past weeks have clearly shown me that if I don't commit, I wont get 30
hours of work done. Or if there is no deadline, I wont get 30 hours
done. I propose that at the beginning of the week, I asses the
situation (based on how the calendar looks like that week) and make a
commitment for each day for that entire week. I will not commit to
doing it every week for the coming year, but I will commit now to do
it for the next week to begin with ([Puppy dog close](https://www.5percentinstitute.com/what-is-the-puppy-dog-close/) anybody?).

Commitment as seen in this blog and with other people (Alexey, Paul
and Peter) seems to be only one part of the story. The other part is
about somehow carrying out the commitment without "much
resistance". It should not be like I am moving a huge rock up a
mountain. And that is where the Pomodoro technique seems to come into
place. So far (last 3-4 days) it has shown that I can work in multiple
2 hr sessions with as little as a half hour break between successive
sessions. And the most important thing is that work becomes much less
grueling when I use the Pomodoro technique.

My name is agent18, I hope to do \>30 hours in the coming 4 weeks.

## Other techniques I want to work on

- Measure how focused I am during a session, and what all I am
  distracted by and address them.
- Make a long term plan and list concrete things I need to do for that.
- Reflect on the amount of work and what has been done, per day, per
  week and per month. Come up with concrete possible changes to
  improve it.
- Eliezer suggests to count down from 10 and jump out of bed at 1, to
  stop procrastinating in bed. Been doing it for a few days now after
  waking up in the morning, and it seems to work.
- Plan the day in advance.
- Org mode to-do list on the cloud or try a Workflowy.
- Keep inbox to 0. Always move mails to Action, Waiting and
  Reference. Started doing this on work emails.
- Focus on doing whats really important.
- Consider going to the library to exclusively have a productivity place.

I thought I understood the following quote, but I was struggling
coming up with an example for a "difficult project" and matching it
with the definition. I didn't realize that was the problem for a long
time. Need to get back to my DP.

> I define a “difficult project” to have some or all of the following

>
> 1. Has long, noisy, and painful, rather than short and clear, feedback
> loops  
> 2. Does not have a well-defined scope   
> 3. Does not have a well-defined deadline   
> 4. Induces anxiety ---Guzey  

> The important lesson of working a lot is to be comfortable with
> taking a break.  The novice productive person will think it virtuous
> to work clear through a break and onward, thinking that he or she is
> making even better use of their time, defeating all those sissy
> workers who need breaks!  But really, this person is just setting up
> their own downfall, because they'll crash and burn.
>
> Burnout is real and one of the most dangerous things you can do is
> train yourself to feel guilty about not working.  So you need to
> remember to take breaks.  The break in a Pomodoro is a good one, but
> I also recommend taking a larger break (like 30 minutes) after
> completing three or four Pomodoros.---Peter Wildeford

> Remember, the goal of being more productive is to free time to do

> Make sure to take some time off to spend with friends and family.
> Schedule it in your calendar if you have to.  This will matter most
