## My name is Agent18 and am a procrastinator

For the last several weeks I have been working for 48 hours a week on
average. But there are many people who are able to work way more than
48hrs a week. My brother claims to work >60 hours a week. [Alexey
Guzey](https://guzey.com/co-working/) claims to work 80 "focused hours" a week with his new
technique. [Peter Wildeford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhurford8/) (previously Peter Hurford) claims to
work 60 hours a week.

With this post I want to understand what I can do to want to improve
my working hours to 62 hours a week on average for now.

The 62 hours is split as 32 hrs on my regular job and the rest 16hrs
working on important things such as blogging, writing, interview prep
etc. The 32 hrs is fairly standard and has to happen as I get paid for
it. There is a lot of variation over weeks in how I spend the rest of
my time on "useful things". From now on these "useful things" shall be
referred to as work.

Even forgiving activities like "working on getting my passport",
"attending team outings", "hanging out with friends for an evening", I
have still had a pathetic record in the last few weeks as shown below
(in addition to my regular 32hr job):

| Wknum  | Amount of hours worked |
|--------|------------------------|
| Wk-1\* | 7                      |
| Wk-2   | 12                     |
| Wk-3   | 31                     |
| Wk-4   | 7                      |
| Wk-5   | 20                     |
| Wk-6   | 12                     |
| Wk-7   | 25                     |

\*`Wk` --> refers to current week and `Wk-1` refers to the previous week.

My procrastination has gotten so GOOD (really BAD I mean) that I took
off on Friday afternoon from regular work and did absolutely jack
squat till the end of the day. Most of it was spending my time lying
down on my bed and trying to gather the motivation to get some work
done, while watching some shit on my phone.

My name is Agent18 and I am a monster procrastinator. With this post I
want to understand what I can do to improve my working hours per week
to >30 hours.

## Is it time to commit?

Two things seem to increase the amount of hours worked per week are 1)
External Deadline. 2) Committing explicitly to someone involving
money. For example, in `Wk-5` I did 20 hrs per week (not great but
better than the average), because I was fed up by the lack of work I
did in the last weeks and COMMITTED to doing certain amount of hours
per day. In `Wk-3` where I did 31 hrs there was a very SERIOUS
DEADLINE as part of an interview at the end of that week. In `Wk-1` I
did only 7 hours and looking at the data suggests that all these 7
hours came from day 1 of the week, where I had a (you guessed it)
DEADLINE. After that day I did jack squat that whole week.

Commitment seems to be invoking the same feel of a Deadline. When I
commit to "finishing 4 hours of work today or I have to pay 20 euros",
translates to I have a deadline by the end of the night to clock 4
hours.

["Productive people" such as Peter Wildeford](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTHe5oGvdj6T73o4o/how-i-am-productive), [Paul Christiano](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4gud47NNqgtsEeEr/my-workflow)
and [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/co-working/) also seem to be suggesting to COMMIT. Paul
Christiano who is a "reputed AI Researcher" seems the use Beeminder on
a daily basis (atleast in 2012). Peter also suggests using Beeminder
to "get into the habit". Alexey seems to be "committing" in the sense
that he schedules a "co-working session with someone specific".

## Carrying on a commitment is hard

Carrying on a commitment is hard. I procrastinate even in the presence
of a commitment (and this has led to me paying up a few times in the
recent past). For example, recently I committed to working 4 hours a
day (for a few days) and I just couldn't get the 4 hours done on a
particular day. I managed to do only 3 of those hours with 2x breaks
which were 1 hr long each. I even had a 1 hr break after 1 hr of
work. And ended up loosing the money I pledged.

One of the issues seem to be of starting early. In theory starting
early would help to finish early. But starting early is hard. Many
days I get ready at 18:00 hrs to start but then decide to do other
things like "watch JUST one youtube video" or "lie down on the bed
JUST for a few mins" etc. Arghhh!

Maybe if I just did a few mins of work I would get into the groove and
nothing would stop me. Well, even on days when I start miraculously at
18:00 hours, I have worked for exactly 7 mins and then couldn't
control my sleep or "tiredness" or "how I would kill to lie down on my
bed" to eventually retire to my bed "just for a few mins".

Once I am in the bed or watching youtube or engaging in other forms of
procrastination, the only thing that convinces me to get back is that
shit gets uncontrollably late the more I procrastinate. So if I start
at 19:00, I have to do minimum work till 12:00 am (assuming atleast a
total 1 hr break in between). Sometimes despite this I procrastinate
for even longer. It takes a lot of will power to metaphorically untie
myself from the bed and eventually start work. 

The breaks I take in between work. And the same shit all
over again, with getting back after work and not spending too much
time on breaks.

write about leechblock bed etc...

Also, I think the tasks I work on don't seem to be helping my
cause. For instance working for 2-3 hours continuously is not a
problem with coding assignments but it is very very hard with such
"exploratory" tasks I have to take-up for writing ("write an essay on
improving productivity").

And perhaps the longevity of the task doesn't help either. 4 hrs I
need to work and do the same uncomfortable thing, Jeez. I don't
remember signing up for back-to-back weeks with commitment. I usually
sign up for one week and then allow the "habit" to take over from
there. Clearly that "habit" never took off.

**Note:** I am at this point seeing that I am at a clear lack of
expressing myself or my understanding. Ok what does that mean. I can't
explain why i think writing "exploratory" is "low  feedback" and has
an "ill-defined scope". In other words I don't have an example for
that claim and I also don't know what in the hell those definitions
mean or how to test it. I was spending a lot of time on it and trying
to come up with an example or write in a proper way, when all there is
to it is that I "fell like I understand it" but it's just about
"definitions" and lack of examples testing that definition.



<!-- Starting trouble --> Committing to do an amount of work seems to
solve only one part of the problem. Starting by 18:00 hours means, I
could finish early 11:00 and can sleep. But I have never really
started at 18:00 hrs. That takes until 1 am. Not Good! How to avoid
this? Well commit to starting at 18:00 hrs. Voila!

<!-- Even if you start you suck --> 

Possibly, but I doubt it is the solution. On those rare days, when I
was really pumped and motivated and start at 18:00 hrs or better yet
17:57, I managed to give in to the relentless beckoning of my bed in a
matter of few minutes. And getting up from the lying down posture is a
proper Herculean task. There are those days, when I literally force
myself to come down at 19:30 hrs and then I hate myself for having
postponed the starting of work. Now I have to stay awake longer to
write. 

It's not the first few mins I need to fight. It's all the 4 hours I
think. Even when I hold my fort and take a small nap on the table and
avoid going to the bed, and continue work, the beckoning of the bed
doesn't stop. I worked another 30 mins and ran to the bed and another
20 mins work and again ran to the bed. I mean, I am just not able to
control my lazyness, lack of will power, 

How about moving away? to another place to work? Like a Library? the
only thing I hate is that I have to go there and working with one less
screen, But it has worked great for me in the past. There used to be a
time when I had the same problem that I just couldn't work at home
because if I lied down on the bed I couldn't bring myself up to get
back to work again. and I remember clocking 3-4 hrs regularly
then. Day in and day out. I didn't sleep in the weekend-afternoons
because I was in the fucking library. At max I slept for 20-30 mins
after starting my work but after that it was go go go, as far as I
remember. For writing it might be ok. I should definitely consider it
in case my next experiment "fails".

The type of task I do doesn't help. the work I do is low-feedback and
highly exploratory (no well-defined scope, no well-defined
deadline). What this means is, there is no clear answer when the essay
is said to be done. There are no cutoffs like when I write 5000 words
I am done. "When I have an ending I have an ending". If this were
playing a video game or working on a concrete data science problem, or
a research assignment where i am trying to find information about a
claim, I have spent hours working on them without taking a break. But
not this type of work. Essay writing in an "exploratory"
way. Something about it is different, the feedback cycle, the
challenge vs skill nad the value of whatever feedback I get. All seem
to be not on par with the things like video-gaming.

Another thing I dread is the longevity of time I need to keep up this
charade for. Everytime I have to do the task, I have to hold the fort
for 4.5 hrs with say 0.5 hrs break. And if I don't work for 1.5 hours
continuously then I feel like suck. If I take a break, I can't quit it
that easily especially because YouTube videos are way more engaging in
these trying times. "It's uncomfortable to stare down a big task or
project - one you may not be sure how to even do or one involves a lot
of uncertainty. So we turn to Twitter or Netflix instead to boost our
mood, if only temporarily." Somedays i end up with having to do 5
hours in the evening and that just becomes the most long and painful
time I have to endure. Especially that I need a break in between and
that usually lasts 30-60 mins. I really can't get myself back with the
carrot that says (I need to do 2 more hours before I get far).

I am addessing one thing and one thing only, maybe I even complete the
tasks and maybe this is ok. I am afraid of sustainability, Never have
I have commited 2 weeks in a row, It's alwaus, ok now I am in the
zone, next week I will do it myself (my ass). And the absolute shit
feeling I have to take with me...

## Enter pomodoro?

easier to start, you have to think about 25 mins. Yes I am not going
to be doing 4 hrs but 3:20 mins but,

---

Peter Wildeford and Paul Christiano both recommend a technique called
POMODORO. As I write this essay on productivity, I decided to give it
a try. The idea is to have a timer (something like [this](https://pomofocus.io/app)), where
there is 25 mins of work followed by 5 mins of break. This goes on for
4 times and then you get a 15 min break. And repeat. Everytime you
finish a pomodoro, you have an alarm bell to start the break and an
alarm bell to get you back to work. It's a proper alarm bell, which i
so far have used the sound to get back to work, or get up from my bed,
or throw my phone away or wake up from my sleep or thought or press
Ctrl-W to go to close the tab on chrome. Of course, all distractions
are muted, phones switched off, leechblock on as necessary and effort
is put to hold those 25 mins without any external distraction.
Depending on the intensity necessary, I use ear plugs as well.

What I like about this is, I have to push through only 25 mins. And
there is a break right ahead in case I needed it. I tried this at work
a few days back and I will say that it was one of the most
"productive" days so far. For the last few weeks since I joined a new
team and I have had to puzzle out and "learn" so much shit. This task
is not well defined, I have to puzzle through a lot. There are
questions I try to answer at the end of the "question" but they are
limited in telling you if you have "learn't". I have been struggling
with keeping my sanity in this team doing this type of work and for
the last 2 weeks. Only after I started this, I actually got shit done
and I felt good, with "little procrastination". POMODORO 1 other
techniques ?.

I didn't think I needed it for my life after sunset. But my
procrastination was taking on a very bad avatar where I was not able
to commit to starting and sticking with it. And I gave it a try. I
really liked that I had to only look at 25 mins ahead. For example,
when preparing for an interview the next day, for the first pomodoro
all I had planned was to setup and pull all the necessary files and if
there is time, think of the different tasks. Then I wrote down some
skeleton tasks like ("say about experience","find old questions from
other interviews", "prep those questions" etc.) and picked it up one
by one for each pomodoro. If I didn't "finish" within one pomodoro, it
went on to the next. And based on pomodoros left, I hurried up and
moved on to successive tasks. I saw I was crossing out the tasks I set
out. And taking the break to just do what ever i want, walk around, do
a bit of planning on what I would do next, or just YouTube or listen
to a song and sing, just a few mins to lie down or just close my eyes
etc. I want to point out that Peter encourages taking this break.

> The novice productive person will think it virtuous to work clear
> through a break and onward, thinking that he or she is making even
> better use of their time, defeating all those sissy workers who need
> breaks!  But really, this person is just setting up their own
> downfall, because they'll crash and burn.

With writing however, today as I write, this is what I am doing. I
have a structure but there is so much re-writing and changing the
structure and removing text. I am really unsure how to put it in
tasks. But roughly with each pomodoro, I am trying to focus on one
section either writing fresh or re-write section. this was I don't
know I feel sane. And in case I feel overwhelmed I have a guilt free
break coming up in 5.

Of course I have a plan that I need to finish the essay by the week
(thats how much time I will spend on it). And I do have a rough plan
on how the essay should look when. when I have all the main ideas and
an ending I think I can pull off the essay in 1-2 edits. Theses are
some "vague indicators" I use to see if I will be ok. 

An Alarm goes off at the end of every pomodoro and break. that is the
tune when Ctrl-W is typed to shut down youtube and get back to the task.

I am ok with taking an L for now, but I want to get the 30 hr mark
regularly be it with these 5 min breaks every 25 mins. I have the
tendency to rush and say slowly I will increase it and there will be
no stopping me, but I want to say no to it. I want to see it through
with this type of learning and breaking. It really is giving me a lot
of peace atleast so far.

I suspect this way i don't feel overwhelmed to meet the "high
standards" I set for myself that I don't meet anyways (1.5hrs of epic
grinding work). It is less hard and I look at times in terms of
Pomodoros, not half an hours I have and what I am going to do. It
sounds silly. but somehow I have a better feeling for a pomodoro than
saying what am I going to do for the next 8 half hours fuck that is a
long time.

Guzey also uses it...

## Write about pomo timings later towards the end

So far I did it I am easily able to do a 2 hr
stretch i.e., 4 pomodoros. then I take a break and do the rest. I
managed to start at 18:30 roughly on both days and wrapped up by
11:15. Which is pretty successful if you ask me. That is 4 hrs of
pomodoro and "breaks" + 45 mins of pure break. I haev done it for work
after dark, only 2 days. I am happy i am able so sustain once I
start. Need more data. But I feel good. It's a start, I am not saying
it is the shit. **write about times as well.**

In 3.5 hours on day 3, I have done 3 hours of pomodoro and one 20 mins
long break. And I also feel good :)

On day 1 for example, in 2 hrs 42 mins I did 2.4 hours of work, It was
quite excruciating I think. 

On day 2 I did 

tell about guzey who swears by something similar.

Maybe with a recap.


It's not always a success, I took 2 15 mins breaks, sometimes I look
at my phone in those 5 ins But taht is ok..


Rewrite this part... bruv? also look at the next section.

## Is being tired just a way to get out of work?

## Measuring focus, Measuring progress?

Progress for me is defined by doing 30 hours of work a week and "not
feeling like shit". And continuing it over the next many
weeks. Starting at said times and

Measure how many times I get distracted.

I don't know if pomodoro is actually improving focus or not. 

Start task and end task in 4.5 hours?

## There is also middle trouble

It's not only the starting but also the remaining period.

- It's boring what to do, its also long, I have 6 more hours to go :(

- big picture stuff might help

- PDCing? does not help? I am unable to close myself to work for 1
  min... I have had that thought so many days when I was lying
  aimlessly on the bed feeling like shit and at the same time doing
  absolutely nothing to come out of it.


- Say what you will I just completed 3 pomodoro back to back without
  feeling like shit, without having (could be a coincidence),
  
- Say what you will I just completed many sessions at work and for the
  first day felt less worthless. 
  
  I feel like it really reduces the burden of having to do another
  fucking 6 hours. and shortens the burden of doing 2 hours at a
  time..
  
  sometimes you are not just lucky to do coding or play videogames
  where you are engrossed for hours heh?
  
  
  I think what is key is to not take off or set the dangerous
  precedent of breaking the HABIT
  
  I have not done a 2 hr session yesterday. I know some tasks where I
  can do that even 3 hrs, where I am doing DP for example and where I
  am looking for information and puzzling out, I really can do long
  times, without no fucking pomodoro. or even coding for that
  matter. But I see the value of it. I am happy that someone asks to
  me to stop and start. 
  
  For the first time in a few days i have hope, that maybe there is a
  way. I mean how long was I going to be in this realm of
  discomfort. Wont I burn out? and when the greats are claiming to use
  it and guzey especially... There is still will power and all that
  bullshit at hand... Let's not deter. :)
  
---

I somehow have it in my head I should work for 1.5 hours or more
continuously and that I should just pull my shit together and get it
done. I know that would be great if time flew like that but sometimes
with these really exploratory tasks where I am shooting in the dark,
not sure and don't have enough content to write like Japanese train,
then I am struggling to focus.

I know the 3 mins rule and the 300 word rule and the 1000 word per
hour trick to generate quantity over quality for now. But But But I am
unable to apply it. As Guzey puts it, 

> However, (1) you need to decide to do this spontaneously while
> procrastinating – which is hard


Also at my regular work, recently I made a change to a new team, and I
need to work on things that don't have a deadline, but I need to
"understand it". There are not clear questions to answer. there is a
bit of puzzling to do on what I need to do and how I do
it. Unfortunately all I am doing is counting down the 8 hrs and trying
to complete something. I think I felt like shit as well, and going to
work was really painful even. I think that is why I took off on friday
that I couldn't handle more of this shit, just puzzling out and
puzzling out. I just couldn't grind for 8 hours on some vague stuff. I
really am at a loss of describing it.

## review it

What and when and what to look for and what concrete thing to change?

I see that I feel saturated... What that measn is the lack of ability
to focus on this, writing task. Vague?

## Other things 

reading, waking up at said time with 10s timer ets..

Making long term plans and reviewing them now and then

Reviewing 

When I feel sleepy i am going to sleep but at the end of the pomodoro
and force myself to continue at the sound of the break. It's a nice
alarm and jerks me from my sleep. I assume that I am training my mind
to that sound. Everytime I hear it, I sit up to work.

## todo

- confusion between working hours and other hours
- do I have all ideas and content check?
- how to get there check?
- write basic content
- re-write every para
- spell check
- footnotes
- upload and check


## POMO

**day 0 20th july** started late at 20 hrs and slept as soon as I
started and had breaks.

**day 1 21st july**
Also slept after starting work.

Used it at regular work, felt much better on many days (got the
feeling of having done something)


Only done at work.

**day 2 22nd July**
Started at 18:31, feeling a bit sleepy but not as much

Work was "ok", lots of distractions from IT, but was not as bad as
friday. There was a rhythm and am still happy to go on this way where
I can guarenteed take a guilt free break.

Took a 5 min sleep and the timer woke me up

Completed more time than I ever did in the last two days by 19:27. I
finsed two pomodoros. 

Finished two hrs. It's still hard to come back after 0.5hr of
break. But I did and here we are.

**Day 3 23rd July**

Was more tired than normal today for starting. I was already late to
start because I went to pals like an idiot.

Realized I had one hr in the morning and didn't want to work too
much. So did 25 mins of the work and then decided to procrastinate for
1.5 hrs. I felt really tired too. Been waking up at 7:15 pretty much
for 3 days straight. But I am just about to complete a solid podoro of
about 3 hours with 20 mins break.


work pomodoro was ok.


**Day 4 sat 24th July**

Still did 2 hours of pomodoro. That is the success of pomodoro. I was
haveing quite some liqor today.
