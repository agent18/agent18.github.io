#### Highlights from 'Answers' made last week

Last week we starte the 'Answers' series to the 'Questions' post. 

>A Socrates can never be convinced about magic. He either has the magic a.k.a, the primary/basic rules, or not.

>You cannot convince a rock, you cannot convince an infinitely powerful computer about south sudan, or a very very smart dog that can talk.

>We have these primary rules, somehow. We can use them to understand the territory better. Initially we thought, blacks should be slaves, women should not have equal right, but then slowly, we discover that they are also just people like us. And then we modify our understanding of the rules. So, we have primary rules somehow, and we can use them to improve our understanding of our rules.

> It appears that as these rules cannot be taught to you- as they are not convincible to someone who doesn't have that rule- the only place possble to receive it from is like from our "father", Evolution, just like how we carry characteristics in our genes.

We have answered the 'basic' questions from the 'Questions' post, mostly off of the 1st discussion with an STM.

#### Rules

>  Shouldn't everyone have the same values? Then Why do terrorists exist? When will Achilles be wrong 

Does everyone have the same primary rules? 

I believe that most of the people have the basic/primary rules that we have been talking about in the last essay. These being:

> If A => B is accepted, then if A happens, then B can be inferred. (intellectual rule)
> Look at evidence to decide what the reality will be like (intellectual rule)
> When people are suffering we should help them (value rule)

Without Modes Ponens, I suppose education would be really hard, or for that matter communication. Evidence based understanding is there everywhere. It's in science religion literally everywhere. But there is a catch, the understanding of evidence seems to differ (#PNN). Will come to that in a bit. Recently, I joined a group on fb that was debating about flat earth and globe earth. The earth is not flat(let's not get into the details of it). But Flat Earthers, made wild claims, and supported every claim with some sort of evidence. To me suprisingly, they had answers for every single question posed by the Globians as we are called. They also looked at evidence, they also had this subjective probability. No surprise that ALL these FE's were Christians, they went out of thier way to make the bible right. Bible is right and from there they bounced with finding "evidence" to fit it. In theory, we have the same rules, but somehow something went wrong.


Peter Singer writes in [Famine, Affluence and ...][], "I suppose, most of them would want to save a drowning baby, even if it means that you get your clothes dirty". Time and again we see several people donating money because it pains them to see others suffer. Although they don't take it to the logical conclusion. Let's for now say that it is due to some H&B's misfiring. But it appears that the rule still holds for most of us. 'Suffering is bad'. 

Looking at the 3 rules for now we know it appears that with some decent confidence we can say that most people have the same/similar rules (!). 

Interesting. But then why do Terrorists exist?

#### But why do terrorists exist if we all have the same basic rules

Hmmm. Our rules tell us what we want. We don't know the exact rules, aka the true solution in the head. We don't know the reality the territory completely. As an STM said in [this post][], your understanding of the solution in the head (current SITH), is very wague. Initially you have a rought map, nothing to scale, some mountains and some water marked here and there. This would correspond to 'don't kill each other', 'help people who are dying', ' help each other to survive and procreate'. But then you can use these rules to understand more about the rules, and discover more of the reality and mark for your reference in the map.

>It is like a rough map of some terrain. Initially, it just marks out some hills and a river (“Don’t kill me, I won’t kill you. Let’s hunt together”). Nothing is to scale. There are vast parts unmarked (“how to treat women, blacks, gays, etc.”). Then, as we gain more and more knowledge, we fill in the vaguer parts of the map (“Ah! Black people are basically just like me. It is wrong to treat them like slaves”)

So not all rules are clear to us, our map is currently shit. It has very basic stuff.  As we saw last week, we are able to change our understanding of the rules, by reasoning, looking at evidence, using methods that show they work every time etc... One of the understanding of the rules changed in the past for me was religion. It just didn't hold up to the questions asked. We need to really put in some effort to understand better and act accordingly despite what we might feel is right (owing to H&B's). It appears that this is where shit went cray. Terrorists, republicans and democrats #pnn. We have this amazing thing called H&B. These were probably a mechanism to bridge the billion rules and billion facts that we would need to process. H&B's are to be undertood as shortcuts. They might have worked well for small problems back in the days, but right now they massively back fire, with [circular preferences][], misinterpretation of the true SITH, etc... 

H&B's such as social proof, social conditioning etc... can really twist the understanding of a persons SITH. It was very easy to believe in religion. We might think we are doing something right. Screwed up logic can sound pefect. We are not trained to critically analyse what people say to us, the anologies they make and how it affects us. Imagine a small kid, growing up with terrorists. Reading the kuran every single day, being told that death is the penalty for , conservative views about how womne should dress and interpretting the saying that, "the world should have only muslims" too literally to the extent that he doesn't mind even giving up his life. Get this! If the same kid was brought up else where he would have different world views. When you see from a high level, you see that the kid is same, but his surroundings make him understand his SITH very differently. However, it appears to be possible that everyone can come to similar ideas in the end, if they followed a rigourous, scientific process of understanding themselves, and the things around them. I say similar ideas because, it's hard for everyones subjective probability to align. Ideally it should. When so many people believe around you that the KURan is the word of allah, why would you believ otherwise? We have a H&B called social proof. #PNN man.

Me, standing in the umbrella with an STM, am thinking about completely different things.

Why am I right? Bitch
Sceince? Tot morgen




How do we use a rule to understand other rules?
