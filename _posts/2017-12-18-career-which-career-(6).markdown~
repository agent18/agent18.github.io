### right approach for you?

>The first thing to note is that these four approaches are not exclusive, and you can do more than one at the same time. For instance, a teacher helps their students (direct impact), but could also develop new educational techniques (research) or tell their students about pressing problems (advocacy). We know a teacher who did private tutoring in order to donate more (earning to give). As we’ve seen, often your impact is more about how you use your position than the position itself. This means, you’ll want to look for the positions that offer the best balance of ways to contribute directly, through advocacy and through donations. In our career reviews, we assess each path on these three ways of contributing.

>Third, do something where you have the chance to excel. Throughout this article, there is a vital general principle to bear in mind: the most successful people in a field have far more impact than the typical career.

>Just as we saw with choosing a problem, this means the most effective approach for you will be something you enjoy, that motivates you, and is a good fit for your skills. We sometimes come across people tempted to do a job they’d hate in order to have more impact. That’s likely a bad idea, since they’ll just burn out. Their example could also discourage others from doing good.

>An outstanding charity worker will likely do more good than a mediocre engineer earning to give, and the reverse is also true.

>On the other hand, as we’ve seen, people often underestimate how easily they can become interested in new jobs.

>If you already have expertise in an area, then that should also be factored in. We have more specific advice broken down by area here, as well as in the career reviews and problem profiles.

### summary

Moreover, if you focus on the approaches that are best suited to the problems you want to solve and where you have the best personal fit, you can do even more good again. And you can do this while having a more satisfying career too.


#### things i could do

1. Plan a career in managing founding companies.

My friend in holland does things like this. Once he hits his success, I will get involved with him. Even for earning-to-give, founding and making money seems to be an option. He has soms contacts in india, who I should meet just to get an idea of what would be possible, if I can start as an apprentice/mentee to someone killing it in business.

2. Data science
3. Economics degree and then normal job

Taking a normal job after such a jump seems pointless. As DS seems to be much more viable option withe more money in it.

4. Economics degree and then a job in the NGO's
This makes sense. Seems to be the need of the hour for the NGO's

5. My current job as an engineer in the precision industry.
Not sure about the career capital I have earned and how it will be useful in non-research based precision industries.
More over the growth in this part of the country seems really slow. For example, someone I know working in paypal, got an untimely bonus of 10k$. What! Doens't happen ever in holland.

At the very least need to look at gaining diff career capital and moving to the US

6. Other options could be to do an MBA/finance degree and try getting into Dubai

I have heard stories where people did philosophy phd and who started working in a finance firm donating about a 6 figure salary. So it would be wise to check out their careers or rather what such a career would need.

7. Programming

Something the idea of which feels so awesome. I would love to get into it, but only if this makes sense impact wise.

Don't know how acheivable such a position is especially considering the over crowded and heavy competition for a job.

>Apply this to your own career
Before we move on, make an initial short list of high impact careers you could work towards in the long-run. The following steps may help:

Done above

>Decide which two to five problems you think are most pressing.
Find the relevant problem profiles, read the list of career ideas in each profile, and note any that could be a good fit for you.

With Global prio research, careers in research, mathematics and economics seem what is needed. I suppose I could get into each of those, but of course the chance of success and that I am already 26 need to be taken into account. Same with AI and health in poor countries. I have listed some of the profiles I could be doing above.

>Go through the four approaches we covered in this chapter, and list out any other options that could be a good fit for you.
The aim at this point is just to come up with more options. We’ll explain how to further narrow down in an upcoming article.



### Reflection and rant

I am just writing and writing and writing. What is the fucking point. What I want to do is to know reliably what I need to do. The approach on a high level seems alright, but I need to spend time understanding things and classifying thigs. Once I understand the problems or note what each problem needs, I should take a step bakc and evaluate what I can do with specific career options. Maybe I can't get far, but that is what the other parts of the essay are. Right now see your pitfall and see how you can move from there.

Once again, the goal is to first see the topics and what they need. How to get there according to 80k and from there on the feasibility and impact. This was good.

How I will go about the feasibility and impact is fully not clear. That is why I guess I am looking at the impact and induvidual profiles to see if it is going to suit me or not.

Another thing I noticed is that I am doing too much, writing and reading. The task is too tough right now. I also see a certain flow. I was able t work 3 hrs straight, which is pretty decent for my stds. I have never really worked so much. I should look to cash in on this type of work. Come early and start early is the key.No pressure. I want to get work done. There is so much of unknown and so much work to do.

In the sprit of deal that I made, I want to reduce the deal such that I do lesser words when I am having to do research. and also reading 10k is almost impossible and leads stright to failure. However, 6k seeems possible.  In the sprit of the deal, I aproove of these choices as I have clocked good hours.

Another thing I should probably consider is about writing well.


My grade of 7.5/10 for my master thesis is not representative of the work I put in or the success of my project. The research direction didn't come from me, as I barely had experience in it. I trusted the faculty to give me a good assignment. Unfortunately, it was more about taking an idea and implementing it to see if it works. Went quite deep into linear algebra. I did a lot of coding, and read a lot of papers. Did everything I could with my time to solve the issue. I dived heavily into the theory, but unfortunately, I didn't think of some fundamental things that questioned the need of my research or the use of it. My goal was not to do research unfortunately, my goal was to learn from the best and learn as much as I could. I spent several hours a day working on python, I spent several months understanding the fundamentals and why things came about. But I do think I am work slow (citation needed, compared to what?)

My point is I learn quick, I work hard when I have a personal stake in the situation. I am sure I can step up and with long time spent on it I can definitely kill. Every extra hour I spend at work would mean more impact and that would be life, essentially. So great.

My current boss thinks I work fast, I pick up things quickly. He didn't expect me to finish the project I had started at the beginning of the job within one month, but guess what. I stepped in for several projects and delivered results according to him at pretty good speed. From knowing nothing in a project, I have delivered, and I continue to deliver, its everyday bro.



An idea could be during the month that I am in india, I could do a course in economics and a course in data science. I am quite inclined to do these as it would free me from the burden of writing. and I honestly wouldn't mind working on these for 4 hrs a day even. Have some pretty decent deadlines and in those 36 days actually crack something.


So, early career, the ideal is to find a job that offers both impact and career capital, but if forced to choose between the two, lean towards career capital.

This doesn’t mean ignoring social impact – it’s best to stay involved through volunteering, conferences, donating 1-10%, and so on, so you stay motivated and keep learning. And if you come across an especially good opportunity for impact, then it might be better to focus on that. Rather, the question is where to put your focus most of the time.

And thats why we move on to Career capital

### Career captial

>The safest jobs are those that involve creativity, high level problem solving, and social intelligence, such as: management, marketing, social work, and engineering.

>In general, the more uncertain you are about the future and your career, the more important it is to gain career capital that’s flexible. One consequence of this is that flexibility is usually most important at the start of your career. At this point you haven’t tried any jobs, so it’s the point when you know the least about what you want to do in the future.

>If you’re really uncertain, then you could make flexible career capital your main focus. As you learn more, you can make your plan more and more targeted. (We’ll cover how to do this in a later article.)

>Just pick an area, perform highly, learn valuable skills, and meet influential people. You’ll end up in a better position than if you try to do a bit of everything and don’t achieve anything.

Consulting jobs

Sales and marketting at ASML?

Investment banking

 If you have relatively good quantitative skills, then consider sales and trading or asset management in investment banking.

>In general, however, we prefer consulting to these options because: (i) it’s growing, whereas these industries are flat and have a worse outlook (ii) it seems to give you a wider range of options (iii) the work is often more engaging at the early levels (though often still boring!) (iv) you get to explore several industries (v) there are better arguments that some parts of law and banking are harmful. Law also requires an expensive up-front investment.

Jack and master of none?

Economics-> one stop option to money, policy, social sciences, academia and social impact

>Dillon couldn’t imagine studying anything except philosophy. Then he found out about the research that shows that our interests can easily change.

Programming?

>e know lots of examples of people who started with no technology background, and within six months ended up with highly paid programming jobs they enjoy far more than their old jobs. Programming is also a growing, in-demand skill that can be used in many areas. Bootcamps are intensive, three-month programmes that aim to get you a job as soon as possible.


Speak to rajesh, how to move to US, options to consider, sales and marketting


>But you don’t need to become an entrepreneur. You can build these “soft” aspects of career capital in almost any job if you perform well. Doing great work builds your reputation, and that allows you to make connections with other high achievers. If you push yourself to do great work, then you’ll probably learn more too.

>There are plenty of cases where someone has turned success in one field into success in another by using the reputation and connections they gained. For instance, Sheryl Sandberg started in consulting, then worked in the Treasury, and is now COO at Facebook.

>This means that if you want to build career capital, it’s worth considering any area where you have good fit, even if it doesn’t seem like a good option in general.

>If you care about social impact, then it’s especially useful to have achievements that involve doing good. It’ll mean you meet people who deeply care about social impact, and that will be more useful than knowing lots of accountants.

>Although we like stories of those who achieved apparently instant fame and early success, like the Forbes 30 under 30, they’re not the norm. Besides those who got lucky, behind most great achievements are many years spent diligently building expertise.

Very important! We are looking at years of work.

>We’ve seen people transform their careers by doing things like learning to program, being mentored by the right boss, and going to the right graduate school.

#### Applying to your career

>Go over all the four paths to career capital and ways to gain career capital in any job, and note down three new ways you could gain career capital.


>Can you work at a high-performance, growing organization?

Not sure what is meant by high-performance. One of my friends works in Portugal, in a DS company. The company is growing, as in hiring new people to start branches in other parts of the world. People usually clock 12 hrs per day I heard. Seems to be a high-performance, growing organization. Another company which is into aerospace consulting, which has very few people is growing and expanding in a variety of regions in the world.

Considering the above examples, I am not sure I have the chance to gain career capital in a highperformance organization. My current work is in a startup, which will either be worth billions in 2 years or not at all. There is no high performance. Everyone is relaxed, atleast in my team. It feels like a government company. I spend a good amount of time doing manual labour to collect data, than actually doing some high-level thinking. This seems to be a flag, that I should watch out for, considering I am in my prime and don't want to be part of simple stuff. Although, they are giving me more responsibility with milestones which is making me work harder.

>Do you have a good option for graduate study?

Maybe.  I am referring to doing a Masters. I have already done a masters in TU Delft, in precision engineering. if I need to move to DS, it might be worth considering to do a masters in the US.

>Can you do something that will teach you a valuable skill?

I could do some courses online in CS, DS, and Economics. Doing courses in DS seem to be a nice way to start in other companies.
Same as CS I guess. I have read in the DS profile regarding just a course being enough to start at a DS company.

It could be an option to also look at marketing and sales.

Being social is something I want to be more good at. With women I find it especially hard to make conversations, unless I am inebriated. As I look at the 80k-org website, I get the impression that this (being social) could also help. Keep and maintain contacts.

Maybe I could join the event organizing team in my company, or join some group outside to spurr more social moving.

>Is there an option where you’ll achieve something impressive, especially if relevant to social impact?

Nope.


>What’s the most valuable career capital you already have? Identifying your most valuable career capital can give you clues about what you’ll be best at, and help you to convince employers to hire you. Review each of the categories:
Skills, which you can break down into (i) transferable skills, (ii) knowledge, and (iii) personality traits,

i) Transferable skills: ability to solve problems of all sorts, some trouble shooting experience and giving support to other organizations. Programming skills from 7months of python, some leadership skills from being the chairman of the student board, design for better assembly and function skills, ability to work on unknown problems and come up to speed asap.

ii) knowledge

Design, dynamics, mechanical engineering basically, FEM, programming,

iii)

Social, Leadership (sometimes), obsession over problem at work, punctual, Determination and persistance, Eager and willing to add to my base skills, ability to co-work well. My co-workers like working with me.


Connections

I know almost all the professors in my department really well. Some of them are famous for their work in their respective fields. I know a big guy in Denso Germany, who got me an interview last time, very friendly guy. And some others in my field and my peers. I worked at a startup and know these people quite well. I know my CTO quite well. I am currently discussing with him regarding my milestone for the company. In india I am still connected to my professors from IIT. I know some startup guys from the my time studying gate and being in IIT.

Credentials:
I am a masters degree holder, with a gate rank of 1061 (98.96 percentile), in one of the popular universities in the world.

Acheivements?

Runway:

I have runway for about 6 months and the rest I am using to pay my loan back to my parents. I can store or generate more runway, as required. Although if I needed to take 2 years off, I
