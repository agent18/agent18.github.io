Right now I have a couple of things to do! 

Find a house, 

finishing the blog post,

do the course in Data science 

writing resume in emacs latex setup and sending out applications. 


## Full time job

Finding a house is a full time thingy. I always need to keep thinking
about it. I need to infuse it with everything I do. I need to
everything I can and stop at anytime to get a house. The way of work
of sending out msgs at fixed hours might not work. I need to do
everything in my power to get this done. Dont stop at nothing. Ask
helena even. 

finishing the blog post, I wanna get done with it. I should wrap it
up, identify the main points and then go ahead and publish it. And
suggest followups on it.

Course on Data Science should follow immediately. With every month you
are paying 40 Euros.

So I give myself 5 more days to finish the whole post. Start with
planning and then 

In summary, blog post withing 5 days. including today ( weekends are
gonna be tight) . I have 25 hrs to work on it. before 11th!

Start by planning!
