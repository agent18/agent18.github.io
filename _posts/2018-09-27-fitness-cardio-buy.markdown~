I want to measure my heart rate and hence judge activity based on it
say measure calories or whatever with bluetooth or what ever

**Preferably a watch that can do it or not**

## Minimum to do

I want to be able to read out avg heartrate and currnet heart rate
during workout. Thats it and other stats if they apply.


## What you might need

- a hearrate monitor and an app

	- runkeeper is at 9.99$ /month :(

- a fitbit

	- there seems to be no evidence that I can happily display avg
      heart rate and heart rate at the same time while workout
	  
	    * [ ] Also look at this app, it might give some hints
	  
- a wahoo tickr or tickr X

	[what is different between the two](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001954110-How-do-Different-TICKR-Models-Compare-)
	
	Maybe go for X if it can really give more info about indoor biking
    and indoor running 
	
		  * [ ] To be checked

	[Good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZBgkTm8RGQ) that explains the different versions. Apparently X
    has treadmill mode and indoor cycling cadence, which is like the
    RPM info!
	
	
		  
## Apps

- runkeeper is at 10$/month :(

- fitbit comes with own app but product costs a bomb

-wahoo app seems to be really good with the exact features I want
i.e., avg heart rate and maybe it also show current heart rate

  * [x] Download wahoo and see what all it can show
  
  It seems tha tit can show avg heartrate during a workout even on the
  app. **I say buy it!** this is as good as it gets with getting such information.
  
- worst case I can return the product if it is not good

order it?

## Fitbit vs Wahoo

At this point Wahoo which needs an external bluetooth device to show
its working and stats, where with a fitbit it is not clear if it can
display. If it can, it is going to be quite pricy ( 200 Euros). If it
cant then its might have to help me, but 
	
## Replace battery Polar t31 heartrate monitor

replace battery of Polar heart rate meter available in the gym
