#### Basics

~- How to convince Socrates, regarding modes ponens? ~

~- How to convince a smart dog, regarding south sudan?~

- What do you mean by the solution inside your head, Value system, rules? How are they different from each other?

- Achiles has same rule today and same rule yesterdays, but then why didn't he realize it yesterday.

- What are H&B's? How are they related to the solution inside your head? Why do they exist?

~- How do we know all people might have the same basic rules?~

- When did you get the rules if you cannot be convinced?
#### Understanding values

~- Shouldn't everyone have the same values? Then Why do terrorists exist? When will Achilles be wrong~

- How do you know your understanding is the best? At some point it is about faith right? How dare you say paranormal activity is fake?
(Peer review, science beased, I just feel it. I am open to change my understanding of the rules, provided the hard evidence provided.)

- What are some important values and why?

**- How much is a human life worth to you? how far do we go to save it?**

- What is H&B and its relation to SITH?

- Why do we feel about south sudan for a very short time? And Why don't we feel like doing anything about it?
####
- Explain the model you are using in Asnwers (2) with citations?
- Why should you look at the world in an ideal setting to determine what you want?

- **How do we know which feelings to trust? What is the criterion with which we can reliably distinguish false feelings from real ones? Does emotional stimulation and visual stimulation help in determining the real value system?**





- Don't we think the life of ants is pointless? Anything that we do is just carrying on some legacy left over by some random process. Why not just do random things?

- Or why not do things that make you only happy for example? Women, sports, food etc...



#### Scope

- What is scope sensitivity?

- Why is every life valued the same when there are 1 million people? Every second bhel puri is not valued the same? Why shut up and multiply?

- How to undo H&B

- What do you mean with 'one does not understand numbers'? What do you forbid and what not?

#### Further conclusions

- What should we do in life, in general? Should we do random things, save lives, or kill ourselves, or just go by our circular preferences?

- How much is a human life worth to you? How far are we expected to go to save a life?

#### Other

- Motivated skepticism, Why is it not important for you know all things with the same rigor?
- Motivation - an excerpt from discussion 2


Differentiating feelings and SITH

Only then I will take action... I need to know exactly what is the worth of the hand. Everything has to come from outside. you cant trust anything that comes from inside?
