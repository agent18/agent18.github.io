what are you afraid of?

bro! Parents always talking, about marriage, I don't like it? what
does it mean!

keep pushing every day!

Anxiety!!!!!

How should I respond! I don't know... every week all they talk about
this!

My mother says, "stress" and all that shit! Let's go! 

let's take it apart!

She's just having peer presssure! they are going to do others!
