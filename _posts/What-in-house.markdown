#### The solemn oath

We will distinguish reality from fakity by one thing and one thing only impact.


#### Problem statement

I have a big decision to make almost as if tomorrow, and I want to make a well thoughtout decision.

What do I need in a house?
I need peace1




What don't I like in this house?
####
I want to leave the current house because

- smoke through my windows
- smoke in the fucking living room, which I am rarely at, but its pungent.
- Consumes a lot of my mental energy (maybe I get used to it. Most likely not considering )
- No study confirms the non-harmfulness of smoking. I really like it when the fucking wind blows left and right on me. When ever I try to keep the window open I have issues.

#### New house
cross breeze. Filled kitchen and bathr0om




I haven't tried talking to anyone here why?
