## Possible stages, information that you would ask , and how you would
ask for this


1. Introduction 

	- Send email introducing yourself
	
	- Inform org about your intentions
	
2. Assessing fit (can be done through email or chat or through a Skype meeting)

	- Does the org work on THP?
	
	- Do they monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of their
      programme?
	  
	- Are they willing and able to provide the information we need
      such as budgets, intervention reports, data on their programmes,
      plans, forecasts, etc.
	
	---
	
	- How did the org manage it's current funding?
	
	- Is the org able to accept donations only for THP programme?
	
	- Can the org absorb more funding?
	
	- Can they use additional funding to scale up effectively?
	  
	- What are their plans to scale up effectively?

	- What are the issues they face while trying to grow?
	
	- Have they tried growing in the past?
		
	- Do they have access to resources to scale up (e.g., people)?
	
	---
	
	- Do they get help from the government or other NGO's
	
	- Can the intervention be integrated into existing health care
      system?
	  
	- Do they have estimates of cost-effectiveness themselves?
	

3. Detailed investigation to meet criteria:

	1. Cost-effectiveness estimates of treated patients 
	
		- Budgets, forecasts and expenditure for the past years (detailed documents)
		
		- Cost per patient per year for treatment
		
		- Impact calculations, monitoring data, intervention reports,
          RCTs, etc...
		  
		- Long term impact monitoring and reports
		
		- Indirect effects

	2. Strength of evidence 
		
		- Impact calculations, RCTs, Studies, reports and data to
          estimate the internal validity
		
		- Attrition rates 
		
		- Is the treatment reaching all the people who actually need
          help. Are they just reaching people with "high motivation"?
		
	3. Room for funding and scalability
	
		- How much funding can they absorb? why?
		
			- How many people are they refusing treatment to?
			
			- How many people in their focus range do they think need
              treatment that they can help with? Why?
			  
			- How they estimate the people who need treatment
			
			- How they plan to reach the people who need treatment?
			
            -  How successful were they in the past in reaching more
               people?
		
		- Budgets, Forecasts and expenditure for the past years
		
		- What is the plan to scale up effectively?
		
		- Are extra donations going to be used effectively?
		
		- Have they tried scaling up in the past?
		
		- What is stopping them from growing?
		
		- Can they run the programme in other locations?
		
	4. Organizational strength
	
		- Evaluate personally from interactions how capable the team
          is
	
		- Do they monitor the programme?
	
		- Are they transparent and willing to share the documents?
		
		- Are they able to provide "proper explanations" for the
          questions we ask and the "right documents"?
		  
	5. Sustainability
	
		- Are they integrated into the existing healthcare system?
		
		- Do they get help from academics, governments or other Orgs?
		
		- Are they able to manage the resources needed in the location
          they are at now and in the future? People, doctors,
          researchers, internet, funds, management etc.
		  
	6. Indirect effects
	
		- Effects on the family, community
		
		- Increase in earnings
		
		- Reduced stigma about asking for help in community
		
		- Increase in sign-ups for the intervention

	7. Practical details
	
		- Can organization accept and use the donations only for this
          programme?
		  
		- If there is going to be some spillover, how much is it going
          to be?

4. Back and Forth to obtain clarification as and when you need something

5. Conclusion and Feedback

	- Call email and thank them and inform about the outcome



## Initial email

Hi, 

This is r2d2s from [Happier Lives Institute](https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/), an organization that
researches, evaluates and recommends funds, to the most cost-effective
interventions, that make people happier.

As part of our research we believe [Thinking Healthy Programme](https://www.mhinnovation.net/innovations/thinking-healthy-programme)
(THP), to be [very effective](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uzLRw7cjpKnsuM7c3/hli-s-mental-health-programme-evaluation-project-update-on). And we were informed by \*\*\*\*
that [Mata Jai Kaur](https://matajaikaur.org/) works on THP.

To understand that if we are a fit for each other, we seek more
information about you. But there seems to be little information that
we could find on your website ([p42 of your 2017 report](https://matajaikaur.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MJK-2017-Report.pdf)) about
this intervention.

We thus ask for your cooperation with information needed to accurately
understand and perhaps evaluate your THP intervention. This would
involve at first a short call to asses our fit with each other. This
way we do not want to waste your time or ours.

Please let us know if you are able to work with us in our attempt to
make more people happier.

Thank You for your time. 

Regards,
r2d2s
