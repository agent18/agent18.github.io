## Introduction

In [this post](/career-update.html) (September 2020) it was decided to move to a Data
Science job, after which I can comeback to figuring out what I needed
to do to get into EA. Basically Data Science is my backup and I would
start my journey in here, while I work on the side to move towards EA.

## Am I already good enough?

As of September 2020, I had already spent about 800 hours on doing the
[Coursera Capstone Series for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) and as part of it I
have some "projects" under my belt. In addition, I have also been
"scripting" in different contexts for over 5 years (at universities)
and I have 1 year experience in contributing python code to an open
source software.

It is "well known" that people from various branches of education
retrain and get into Data Science. In the semiconductor company I work
in, I am aware of people who moved into data science from Physics (back
in 2018). Another example, is a PhD in Neuroscience who moved to a Data
Science Job with 6 months of training, she claims [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-went-from-zero-coding-skills-to-data-scientist-in-6-months-c2207b65f2f3) (Jan
2020). She barely knew how to code when she started of. However it
appears she has years of experience in design of experiments,
statistics etc.

I personally know a few people from the university I did my Master's
in. A guy with an embedded systems Master who did a 9 month thesis on
Deep learning, and a girl from Energy Engineering who did her
internship in shell in "data management", got into roles titled "Data
Scientist". (It was back in 2017 when they got the job.)

Looking at the experience of other people (who did a master's like me
from Netherlands and at the same institution) maybe I was already
there, and applying might just end up working out.

## Applying 

With the help of an Apple Data Scientist (who looks at a 50-100 CV's a
year for hiring), I made a new CV and applied to 25 companies. But I
didn't get a single call for Junior roles even ("Jr. Data
Scientist"). I applied to exactly 25 companies that I found on
LinkedIn Jobs (neglecting the experience or language requirements
listed[^4]). 

Upon requesting feedback, one HR from "bol.com" (company in
Netherlands) told me that I had a "mechanical degree" (implying that
it is not "math"), and that there were 100's of people who applied and
"many of them" had experience (unlike me).

A "team lead" from another company seemed interested in me when I
called him up. Even though I was not a fit for the "data science
consulting role" that he had now, he put me in touch with another
branch. Unfortunately, they didn't have any vacancies. He also
informed me that "doing Kaggle" is a "right direction" for me to "get
experience" and that he also worked on Kaggle competitions with his
colleagues.

Some people responded to my applications asking me if I knew
Dutch. Unfortunately, I am not good enough in Dutch for them.

Many vacancies wanted me to be able to use decision trees and other ML
techniques (amidst other things), which I didn't have any experience
in. As a result these techniques were not stated in my CV. This could
have also been an issue.

At this point I could continue to apply to more companies (it was also
nearing December) or I could work on myself for the coming months. I
had no belief that sending more applications would get me anywhere,
especially after the responses I was receiving for the current
applications. And here I thought Kaggle was the only way to "gain
experience", gain credentials to write on CV and then, job!

## "Working on myself"

I "fixed" my CV with clarifying that Mech master's is math intensive
(in Linear Algebra and Calculus). I did a course on Machine Learning
and then went on with doing Kaggle for 2-3 months.

I worked on legacy competitions so that I could learn from the best
solutions. I would try a solution myself and learn from the greats
what the better solution was, and then implement it. After grinding
for about 3 months I ended up with top 10% scores and top 20% scores
in 2 sets of competitions in applied machine learning. Yes, I did get
help from the actual solutions for one of the competitions, but there
was still a lot of work to do and I learned a "lot" working on
it. This part about me not owning my solutions a 100%, barely mattered
in the end (the next section has the details).

I made a [blog](https://tkravichandran.github.io/my-fast-ds-blog/) and wrote my experiences in Deep Learning and
Machine Learning. I highlighted in my CV my achievement of "top 10%
solutions in Kaggle". Boasting such a "powerful" credential it was
very likely to grab the eyes of recruiters. Well!

## Apply again

This time I applied to 60+ vacancies (neglecting the experience or
language requirements listed). I stopped counting after a point. I
expect the actual number to be in the order of 80-100 applications. I
applied to full-time vacancies I mostly saw on LinkedIn Jobs, 2
through referral and a 2-5 internships too. In addition I started
speaking to several Managers (15-20) within my company to look for
jobs inside.

No one seemed to care about Kaggle :(. Half way through the
application process (30-40 applications later) I realized no one is
interested in hiring me as a Data Scientist. 0 interview calls. I got
a call from an HR who asked me what this Kaggle was and in the end
realized that it was not "real work experience" and didn't come back
to me after. 

Lowering my expectations I started applying to titles such as Data
Analyst and Business Analyst. I tried a few things over the course of
applying to these companies, such as sending the same CV substituting
"data science" with "data analyst", removing image processing
credentials, putting focus on "SQL, python, tableau", etc. This time I
got 2 calls for the next stage from other companies and 2 calls from
within my company.

I got 1 call from a company called Picnic, but they had such high
standards for entry where I didn't manage to clear their "IQ test". I
ended up with a 47 percentile score while they needed a 70 percentile
score. I got another call from a second company who said they had a
"good interview" but they thought I was too junior and needed someone
who could "already run from the get-go".

Within my company I managed to secure 2 jobs where "data analysis" is
involved. I am expected to "deliver insights from customer data",
while interacting with a dozen or more "domain experts" and tell a
concise story in the end. It seems to focus on ["diagnostic" and
"prescriptive"](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/07/4-types-data-analytics.html) "data analysis" and not on the "[predictive](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/07/4-types-data-analytics.html)" or
"descriptive" "data analysis".

But what happened? Why didn't a single soul from outside my company
want me?

**Post-mortem**

I still don't know whats wrong or missing with me and what I could do
to improve my chances. Rejection emails were quite useless with
responses like, "there are other candidates who fit the requirements
better than me". Mailing people back for feedback seldom resulted in
replies. When I called them, they simply didn't pickup. Repeatedly
following up was taking the whole day with barely any progress. I
spent most of a day calling just 5-6 companies and getting in touch
with about 1 in the end. It was taking the entire day to focus on this
and make the calls, prep before the call etc. Very different
experience than what I had in 2016. Everyone would answer my call back
then. EVERYONE!

Many jobs (35% of applications as per my notes), I applied to wanted
work experience of \>1 year as a Data Analyst.

I think I don't fit in the Data Analyst pool (SQL, visualization,
python, cloud exp), or the Data scientist (machine learning in
addition to Data Analyst skills) pool. For example, for a Junior Data
Analyst position in ABN AMRO which basically needed python, SQL and
visualization, I got the feedback that I was rejected because people
like me will be bored in 6 months, + there were 100s of applications
and that I might be suited for "Advanced Analytics". And when I apply
to Data Science positions which require Machine Learning ("advanced
Analytics"), I barely get an interview.

It appears that knowing Dutch would have helped. Quite a "few"
companies replied to my initial application, checking with me if I
knew Dutch, and consequently rejected me because I didn't know
Dutch. Around 25% of the companies *at least* were explicitly
mentioning that they needed dutch (as far as I made notes on
this). There were also companies that didn't mention anything in the
job details but said in the rejection letter that they require fluency
in dutch. I even tried traineeships geared to train you and send you
to a proper job in data. But they also rejected me on grounds of not
knowing Dutch.

Within my company, the feedback I got was varied. For data science
positions, either people didn't have a vacancy or they wanted someone
with "real experience" (or a "real education") or in
some extreme cases, ONLY PhDs. WTF!

## What did other people do?

I looked at one of the "popular" bootcamps here in Netherlands
(Ironhack). This bootcamp boasts "reasonable" statistics after 2020
January: 67% people got "what they wanted" (job, internship,
knowledge) within 3 months and 76% got "what they wanted" in 6 months
time.

I found a lot of profiles from the bootcamp and focused on people who
graduated after May 2020. I contacted many of them and some of them
were kind enough to give me really detailed responses. From talking to
these people and in many cases just looking at their LinkedIn profile,
I have the following data on what people are doing, how long it takes
them to get a job etc.:

1. Some people who had a background in Translation [are just starting
   internships after 7months](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nenashevavictoria/), in a small company (9 employees).
2. Some people with [Media](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonvanderlee/), or with [chemical engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahbusson/)
   background but no real experience, managed to find "basic"
   ([optimization of web analytics](https://web.archive.org/web/20201230133717/https://relevantonline.eu/join-our-team/technical-data-analyst/), using google analytics) data
   analyst jobs after 5-7 months, in an small company (18 employees).
3. Some people who are from an [engineering background very
   similar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miriamcc/) to mine started their internship (in spain) after 1-2
   months of end of bootcamp. And then followed it up with an actual
   job as a "data engineer" in another 1-2 months in a startup (27
   employees).
4. Some people who have an MBA were able to manage jobs within
   [one](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusichen/) and [6 months](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudisna-lenka-897337a0/) of end of bootcamp. [26 employees]
5. Some people with marketing experience are [finding jobs in the same
   domain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roosrabenberg/) within 2 months with "multiple offers" and a small
   number of applications (30). This is also a small company (67
   employees).
6. Some people with a [PhD in neuroscience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonidasfaliagkas/), are able to get a job
   after 4 months of bootcamp. This guy made 100+ applications with
   only 3 being converted to interviews, eventually landing a job in a
   mid-sized company (1900 employees).

\* internship in spain and then job in Netherlands as "data engineer".
\*\* 30 applications with "multiple offers", didn't qualify "IQ tests"
and had the luxury to say no to companies that didn't interest her.
\*\*\* Applied to 100+ companies, failed "IQ tests" and made it to 3 interviews.

When an STM mentioned on Jan 5 2021 that maybe I should try to find
more people "similar" to me, I thought I couldn't find more examples
than the ones I had in the beginning (I was wrong). These examples
would have been nice to know. They give insight into where to apply,
how to find those companies, what people in the pandemic are doing to
get jobs, if it is even possible to get an internship etc.

**What I didn't do that other people did**

I didn't do this bootcamp, but I don't think that was the reason why I
didn't find a job. Knowledge wise I think I have the skills taught in
the bootcamp. The syllabus looks the same as what I have done in the
past. People who have completed the bootcamp also think that I might
not need this. The bootcamp is targeted for people with 0 coding
experience while I am not really a beginner. I also compared the type
of output these people are generating vs mine. For example, I compared
[my tableau dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/profile/thej1011#!/vizhome/My-covid19-dashboard/UnderstandingVaccinationsandveCasesacrosscountries) to [theirs](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sudisna.lenka#!/) and it looks just as
"simple".

In addition to courses, the bootcamp has a career week where they give
you tips on your CV and "help you with your job search". When I
checked with people from the bootcamp, they suggested it was "basic"
and that I could afford skipping it if I have applied before.

I can however still learn from what people actually did to get jobs
such as additional projects done, how their CV looks and types of
companies they applied to. People don't seem to have worked on
additional projects besides those in the bootcamp. Their CV looks way
"clearer" than mine and they stuck to 1 page instead of my wordy 2
page CV. And most of them applied to "small companies/startups". I
didn't know how to find such companies until I asked some of them and
they shared links. I will replicate these the next time I am applying.

I applied for less than 2 months while most of them seem to have
applied for more than that. I did maybe 80-100 applications (half of
it was for "data science" roles) while some people did more than 100
applications for data analysis roles alone. Regular applying and
rejections was getting very hard for me to bear amidst the total lack
of feedback. And I just wanted to settle for anything after those 2
months of disappointment.

With this new information, I could modify my CV, target startups
exclusively and see where that gets me over another 3-6 months. Should
I though? Don't I have a job already in "Data Analysis"?

## Is this the "right" data analysis for me?

I managed 2 similar "data analysis" jobs within my current
company. But I don't know if this is the "right data analysis" role
for me. It feels like this job might be missing skills that "most"
jobs outside the company require. Out of 27 applications I made for
the role of Data analysis (and have recorded data on), at least 15 of
them wanted SQL, at least 12 of them wanted python/R and at least 10 of
them wanted Visualization skills in Tableau or other similar
software. None of which I will be doing in this job. Everything is
done in MATLAB.

As a result, I could potentially have a "growth" which lags by "X"
years from that of a person who does data analysis outside my company
(say by virtue of using SQL, python and Visualizations). And this "X"
might be important to know quantitatively as it drives the answer to
the question: Should I continue to invest time in finding the "right
job", or Should I continue with the "data analysis" role within my
company?

## The Final Trade-off

These are some of the options I have, and using lifetime calculations
for each scenario it is possible to see which is better:

1. I could look for another 6 months to 1 year to get a job or
   internship in say "e-commerce", "web-analytics" etc., and end up as
   a data analyst. And then start with focusing on EA. Essentially
   this is delaying the EA path by 1 year. ([Lifetime calculations
   here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=489736222&range=H30): "Opportunity Costs 3")

2. I can continue the Data Analyst job that I have now and move on to
   focusing on the important questions related to EA. I will even
   assume in this case that compared to option 1, this plan will set
   me back by 2 years in case I don't "make it" in EA. This way I make
   a conservative estimate. ([Lifetime Calculations here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=1714565674&range=H30):
   "Opportunity Costs 4")
   
3. Do a Post-master's program--recommended by a manager in my company
   who didn't want to hire me now--for 2 years in Netherlands and then
   find a Data Science job and then start with focusing on EA.
   
   It will be 3 years from now, before I finish it (Age 33-34) and get
   a job. It's already costly for delaying the EA path by 1 year (as
   shown below with Lifetime calculations for cases 1 and 2), let
   alone by 3 years. In addition starting to learn new skills after 30
   is going to be "hard" [citation needed]. So the sooner we start in
   the EA direction the better.
   
Lifetime calculations for the above 2 out of 3 cases are shown:

   
| EA Track | Low  | Best Guess | High  |
|----------|------|------------|-------|
| Case 1   | 860k | 1.335m     | 1.8m  |
| Case 2   | 870k | 1.365m     | 1.86m |

It seems that continuing with the Data Analyst job that I have now in
my current company and focusing on EA right away, is the better
option.

## Conclusion

Am happy that I am in some sort of a "data analysis" position, and
that I get "some experience" while my daytime job is not fully a waste
of time. As the calculations seem to suggest the delay in finding a
"real Data analysis job" might not be too detrimental. So for now, am
going to get to the bottom of the questions I left hanging in the last
post such as, "what I need to learn/do to get into EA"? "Can I get
empirical evidence of lifetime potential of an EA job"? etc.

In any case, I think it is a good idea to re-evaluate the situation in
6 months. I will have more idea about my job in a few months. I will
get to talk to several people and get examples of where this path has
taken others (#examples). Meanwhile I will also "network a bit" by
joining "meetups" to meet other similar data science folk.
