Just published a new essay. Would love to hear your thoughts.

Also updated the Explain a Change, Not an Absolute Outcome essay:

+ Added a new example at the end of the essay. Let me know if you were able to follow it and if it added any value beyond the examples you already saw.

Questions about the new essay (Toggle the factor you're curious about):

+ Was the Blondlot example clear? Was it easy to see how to test his theory? Was the solution clear?

+ Was the hypothesis clear? Why should you toggle a factor?

+ Could you tell that toggling also included changing it in degrees?

+ Was it clear when it said that a proposed model should show that its relevant factors are actually relevant? How do you do that?

+ Was the caveat about baselines clear?

+ Was the caveat about toggling on top of a non-default outcome clear? I haven't gone into too much detail there.

+ Were you able to follow the HPMOR pouch example? Did you get all the claimed relevant factors? Were you able to toggle them?

+ Did the other examples help? Could you see how Pasteur unpacked "air"?

+ Was the "active voice" example helpful? What about the way to test the impact of techniques?

+ Did you learn anything new? Could you see any useful applications?  

Thanks again for your feedback. I'm writing faster than I did a couple of weeks ago now that I get quick feedback. (RFs, anybody?)
