Need to further break down "number of 'good quality' people". Are we
talking about (a) the number of people in the world with a certain
level of qualification (say, PhD in Economics and 2 years of work
experience), whether or not they work in one of the EA organizations,
(b) the number of people who applied for a particular job posting, or
(c) the number of people who were hired?

(What is this "quality" you speak of?)

What they say and think about the number of candidates fit for the job
is different from the number of people hired or the other claims we
saw above. Stick to one claim at a time. See what happens when you
don't try to test the claim "holistically".

short on cash"? "affected by funding"? "ability to immediately deploy
available talent is weak"?

Unfortunately, my dictionary is defective and seems to have omitted
those words, so I'm having a hard time following this.

How are you supposed to test the claim that someone is "short on
cash"? He didn't hire a million people? Even Bill Gates didn't hire a
million people.

Contrast that to: this year's hiring budget. Even if that number is
not directly available, you could look at related numbers like last
year's expenditure on salaries and other overhead, last year's funds
raised, and thus whatever surplus amount they have for hiring this
year (this is one way people may decide their hiring budget; they may
also look at their projected funds raised this year, etc.). Example:
MIRI budget breakdown -
https://intelligence.org/2019/12/02/miris-2019-fundraiser/.

So, one way to look at claims of "funding-constrained" is to see the
growth in budget and check if there was a surplus compared to last
year and if more of that went into hiring new employees or if it went
into higher salaries for existing employees, administrative costs
(like managers or accountants), and higher rent for a bigger office.

Why does this matter? If someone's projected budget is not higher than
last year's, then he probably doesn't have much budget for hiring new
employees. In that case, I would predict that donating more would
probably lead to more hires and thus hopefully more impact (SST). But
if his projected budget is higher and he still doesn't allocate much
for new hires, then I wouldn't expect to see more donations to lead to
more hires and more I-word. Much of that money might go into higher
salaries or a bigger office (which may or may not lead to less I-word
but will probably be different from that for new hires).

This is answering a different kind of question from the question for
this section. This is about "does the age of the organization affect
how much they 'seem to want money'?" But the question for this section
was "are they 'short on cash'?" #SeparateThyClaims

Lovely. Keep up the great work, Mr. Agent. 3.6 hours per day calls for
a nice celebration (alcohol or whatever you prefer as a treat). Here's
to several thousand hours more.

*****

Mission #7: Here's your mission, should you choose to accept it - take
up some passage that has **confused** you (could be about work, politics,
EA, or AI), narrow down its claims, and test them with one concrete
example each. The **output dimensions** for each claim would be whether
you have a concrete example for the subject and the predicate and
whether the example actually talks about the same thing as the claim
(survey vs acceptance rate).

The twist is that you have to rewrite the sentence till the claims
without concrete examples are gone. For example, "we are short on
cash" will become "we have zero budget for new hires this year" plus
example.

## important take away and claim

So we have the **claim**: Meta-orgs don't seem to be "affected by
funding" while hiring researchers. Let's say I wanted to test this
against **EE** and not with "OPP didn't want to hire in that round
because of ...". Then, I see the problem. I can't test it bro. Hell I
don't even know what it means. I am lost.

Let's try another,

**Claims**: Meta-orgs don't want to hire more researchers ~~not
because of funding issues~~ despite having enough funding.

Even this is not good. SS is hurting like hell "don't want to hire more
researchers", "despite having enough funding". 

**Claims**: Meta-orgs do not allocate more funding than previous year
to hire more researchers (than last year), despite allocating "more"
funds to other things like bigger office etc...

This seems to be testable by checking budget as an STM has
informed. Ufff! that took time to get to.

**Lessons**: Make claims testable by removing the fluff ("affected by
funding"). Go back to square one, subject predicate level to identify
the fluff. Agent is struggling with complicated claims ("affected by
funding"). As soon as you change that complicated part, you can modify
the claim to make it testable (as shown above).

### EA orgs hiring

Research, Operations, Entrepreneurship 

1. 

**Claim**: EA orgs don't seem to be able to hire the number of
*Entrepreneurs* they set out to, at the end of a hiring round.

**Re-write claim**: The number of people who were accepted at the end
of the incubation round for Entrepreneurs, is greater than or equal to
the number of incubees budgeted for at the beginning of the year.

**Subject**: The Number of people who were "accepted" at the end of an
incubation round for entrepreneurs

**Predicate**: is greater than or equal to the number of incubees
budgeted for at the beginning of the year.

**Example-sub**: [17 people](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship) accepted 

**Example-pred**: 10 people budgeted for "initially".

Note: It is hardly possible to see from the [budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pVLfqvE8cIQDcRKHN4L_YnFbOilLQG-dC5DtNWvLUxw/edit#gid=0) how many
people they budgeted for. But the CEO informs via mail that it was 10
"initially" for the year 2019.

> At the very start, we budgeted for 10 but moved it up to 12 after
> getting a better sense of applications eventually having in 13 in
> the program.

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; yes; ecm; Yes; s-1;

**General**: Budgets are hard to find (let alone read). CE's budget
was hidden in a blog post which I got a hold of only after reaching
out to them. :(

Hmm. I didn't really expect that based on what was said initially. In
the last essay I literally said that: " EA orgs *don't* seem to be
able to hire the number of *Entrepreneurs* they want, *at the end of a
hiring round*." But looking at the re-written claim this is not
true. The contrast is baffling. I thought they meant one thing but I
ended up with the opposite.

> Last year we were not management, mentoring or funding constraint
> and would have let in more people if we thought more people could
> found an extremely impactful charity.

"if we thought more people could found an extremely impactful charity"

Ah man. I hate English.

2. EA orgs don't seem to be able to hire the number of *Researchers*
they set out to, at the end of a hiring round.

**Claim**: EA Orgs are able to find the people they want while hiring Researchers

**re-write Claim**: The number of people who were hired at EA Orgs in
Research is equal or greater than their goal for that year.

**Subject**: The number of people who were hired at EA Orgs in
Research

**Predicate**: is equal or greater than their goal for that year.

**Example-sub**: In 2019 [7 joined their research team](https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/).

**Example-pred**: They wanted to have [3-5 signed offer letters](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity) from new
research staff as per their goals explicitly stated in their blog.

**Definition**: 7 \> 5

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**General**: Getting info from GiveWell's budget was hard.

---

3. Operations

**Claim**: Ea Orgs don't seem to be able to hire the number of 

**re-write Claim**: The number of people who were hired at EA orgs in
Operations is equal or greater than their goal for that year.

**Example-sub**: In 2019 [3 people joined the operations team](https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/). 

**Example-pred**: In 2019 GiveWell wanted [to hire 1 operations associate](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity).

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes;

### EA orgs types and hiring

4. 

**Claim**: *Longtermism* organizations are able to find the people they
are looking for.

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at Longtermism Orgs is
equal to or greater than their goal for that given period.

**Subject**: Number of people hired at Longtermism Orgs in a given period

**Predicate**: is equal or greater than their goal for that given period.

**Example-sub**: MIRI had 8 research staff in [Jan 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180113211347/https://intelligence.org/team/). MIRI has
[16 research staff as of Dec 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20191224082740/https://intelligence.org/team/). But, Marcello Herreshoff seems
to have left during that time and Nate Soares seems to have taken the
"leadership" role. `16-(8-2)=10`. So they did end up hiring 10 new
people.

**Example-pred**: [10 research people to be hired in 2 years](https://intelligence.org/2017/12/01/miris-2017-fundraiser/) (from 2017)

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**Disclaimer**:

According to MIRI, they were up by [8 research staff as of
2019](https://intelligence.org/2019/12/02/miris-2019-fundraiser/). It appears MIRI is looking at net population of staff. And
they also hired one person before 2019 ended for February 2020 and now
another joins in May 2020. *Making it 10* delayed over 6 months.


Thalaiva thank you for showing me. Inshallah inshallah! Too soon? It's
still hard matching the evidence with the claims.

And thalaiva should I go dvorak? emacs vandhachu.. Then I will also
invest time already. 

the amount of persuasion I feel to do better, to not suck, to realize
that I suck seems so important. When I do this work is where I get to
that level. Pandya! common bro... Persuasion is king. Persuasion is everything

Linkedin is no good to look at as some members are not accessible

budgets are not complete for 2019... what to do?

Looked at wayback machine

5. 

**Claim**: *Meta orgs* are able to hire the number of people they want

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at Meta Orgs is equal
to or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Subject**: The number of people hired at Meta Orgs in a given year.

**Predicate**: is equal to or greater than their goal for that given
year.

**Example-sub&pred**: 

Unable to find more info on forecasting or budgets from OPP. And from
their website it appears they didn't have a clear idea of how many
people they wanted as GRs. They keep stating ["several" Generalist
researchers](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities) in 2018. So we skip that.

OPP was looking for [one Director of Operations in 2018](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities). OPP hired
[Beth Jones from May 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-jones-4b16392b/) (whose applications closed in May).

OPP seems [to be looking for atleast 1 grants associates](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities). [Jan
2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180105182929/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team) shows 2 people with that function (Grants associate), Derek
Hoph got promoted and [by Nov 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181128184458/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team) Anya Grenier joins leading to
`2-(2-1)=1` hire as they had forecasted.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

No info [here](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities).

No where does it say they wanted only 5 or that they decided to hire
only 5. Budgets are no where to be found.

DEAD END

Open phil is not explicit about how many they want in [2018](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities) or [2019](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-progress-2018-and-plans-2019)

Need to check the claim and all that later.

3 claims and it takes 3 hours. :( Speed up pandya

6. 

**Claim**: *GH&P orgs* are able to hire the number of people they
budgeted for

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at GH&P Orgs is equal
to or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Subject**: The number of people hired at GH&P Orgs in that given year

**Predicate**: is equal or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Example-sub&pred**: GiveWell[ 2018 goals was to  hire 1 head of growth](https://blog.givewell.org/2018/04/20/givewells-outreach-and-operations-2017-review-and-2018-plans/) and
in June [Ben Bateman](https://www.givewell.org/about/progress/2018-review#Outreach) started.

<!-- Regarding researchers, they admit to not having clear picture about -->
<!-- how many they wanted to hire ([Research point 6: hire flexible -->
<!-- research capacity](https://www.givewell.org/about/progress/2018-review#Outreach)) in 2018. -->

In 2019, they wanted to have [3-5 signed offer letters](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity) from new
research staff. And [7 joined their research team](https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/).

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; yes; pre; yes; ecm; yes;

I have checked in the past and GiveWell doens't really provide how
many they want to hire. But perhaps I can look at their budget and the
outcome as mentioned in teams in archive.org.

The trouble is not in finding the number of researchers added (with
archive.org), but it is in, forecasting.

**Claim**: *Animal EA orgs* are able to find the people they want

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at Animal EA Orgs is
equal to or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Subject**: The number of people hired at Animal EA Orgs

**Predicate**: is equal to or greater than their goal for that given
year.

**Example-sub**: 0 senior researcher by the end of the year 2019 since
Oct 2019 comparing web archive team's page of ACE.

**Definition**: Claim is false.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**Problems**

Unable to extract proper forecasts:
https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/room-for-more-funding-2019/#fn2-1-26652

Is program officer hired or needed?

Whether they hired someone or not can be found easily either through
websrchive, or through their [budgets comparing last year and this
year](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/transparency/financials/). But the forecasts are hard to come by

There are no budgets available, even if they are they are not useful
as they don't have the forecasts which is what one would be interested
in.

8. 

**Claim**: The type of organizations (AI, GH&P and Meta) in EA doesn't
seem to affect whether the org can find a hire or not.

The type of organizations in EA does not change the statues if an org
is able to meet the forecasted number of hires by the end of the year.

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at different types (AI,
GH&P and Meta) of EA Orgs is equal to or greater than their hiring goal for
that given year.

**Subject**:  The number of people hired at different types (AI,
GH&P and Meta) of EA Orgs in a given year.

**Predicate**: is equal to or greater than their hiring goal for that
given year.

**Example sub&pred**: As we have seen above, AI org MIRI predicted a 10 people
hire in 2 years and seemed to have exactly accomplished that. 

Meta Org OPP wanted to hire a director of operations and one grants
associate and have been successful in those endeavors by the end of
the year.

GH&P org GiveWell wanted to have 3-5 signed offers for researchers in
2017 and ended up with 7. :)

**Definition**: checks out.

**Claim**: EA Orgs are happy with their recent hires.

EA orgs feel that their recent hires are good and not that they need
more experience.

Post analysis more like... so ho would you test?

surveys?

EAs published more research than previous hires?

Those EAs got in more grants than previous hires? Very hard to check
and find out. Let's skip as it adds little value to us.

I think I just wanted to check if EA orgs "feel good" about their
recent hires. did they have a good conversation? did they feel like he
is good at the job without looking at any metrics?

Or same as last claims?

such a vague claims.


hard to check, very vague claim, possible to do with feelings

**Claim**: The number of good quality people are high.

**re-write claim**: The percentage of PHD's or people with greater
than 3 years in EA, and who applied and didn't get the job is greater
than 5% of total.

Need to ask orgs for info hiring round data.


But how else can I do this?

How else can we predict the quality of people who applied

There are PHDs or people with 3 years EA experience or people who
started EA chapters who applied but didn't get...

**re-write Claim**:  There are people they recommended to other orgs

number of prospective candidates according to EA is hard, 

But I can see the people in the last round were 2ce the number for
research <-- Skip it already done. work and focus on failures.

**Claim**: Senior staff within governments and top AI labs are
struggling to find experienced and qualified AI talent to employ.

What the fuck does struggling even mean?

Are they unable to hire people after budgeting them?

Are they looking for experienced people for a particular set of money?

what does struggling mean?

**re-write Claim** AI labs are not able to fill the positions which
planned to the previous year.

Do EA orgs have room for more funding to add more hires?
^
|
|

Do their budgets remain the same for last two years? => Room for
funding more people or perhaps they don't want to grow

Do their budgets increase for hiring? => implies they have funding for hiring

Do their budgets increase for other things besides hiring? => then
they probably don't want to hire more people...


How to test "AMF has room for additional funding for more
interventions"

You can look at their budgets from the past and present and forecasts.

Look at forecasts of what they want to do and the amount of funding
they got last year? also maybe look at eventual impact?

Moving on...

----------------------------

<!-- today starts here 03/07 -->

**Claim**: AI Orgs are short on cash to hire people

orgs have allocated no more budget than last year.

Orgs don't have money allocated in their budget to hire new people. 

and if they have cash to do other things like rent a new space, then
they are probably not "short on cash"

You could also look at some indication of budget... such as salaries +
overhead minus fundraising etc...

**re-write Claim** Orgs don't allocate more budget than last year to
hire people? but they allocate more money for other things like a new
desks?

Meta orgs


- and then GH&P orgs don't seem to be short on cash for
entrepreneurship???

Budget is not avail;able...

15 claims.... work on next 15 after that...

--- 

**Claim**: We are heavily funding constrained and have the management
capacity and hiring talent pool to quickly grow if given more money.

**re-write claim**: We have forecasted

**Claim**: Orgs want to hire more people but money is stopping them
from allocating more budget.


So then it is not clear to me how to make  a claim. because I think of
RP. They want more money and have already planned it. If they get more
money this is what they are going to do. 

isn't this good enough?

Does peter say

I think the biggest problem is in the definition itself. thats where
all the stuggle is happening.agreeing that something testable is the definition.

Just looking at an unchanged budget is not make or break

When forecasts are not being met with money for hiring.

Forecasts can be on the blog.

Fundraising not being met? where the forecast allocation was for
hiring.

Its unclear if they met their fundraising gap RP: for 2019 or 2020. so far.

### claims from woek

**Claim**: When you make two measurements, error reduces by sqrt(2)

**re-write claim**: When you have random errors in your measurement,
with each measurement the uncertainty reduces by sqrt(#).

**Subject**:  When you have random errors in your measurement,
uncertainty of 1 measurement and uncertainty of 5 measurements

**Predicate**: is a factor of sqrt(n)

**Example**: There is a 99% chance that if you make a measurement your
error is within +-3sigma (provided the error is a normal dist)

But if you make 2 measurements your 99% chance of being within the
+-3sigma/sqrt(n).

You can check the SD.

**Claim**: It doens't matter what is the distribution of the random
variable. Doens't have to be normal

dice example

Works with poinsson, but a better example is indeed dice... the dandom
variable of value of die is a flat line, which becomes different 

temp.r in agent18 has the formulas

**Claim**: Thermal from different source adds up and doesn't

*Not doing it.*

At work I often in the recent days... Take one example and explain
things so that I understand to begin with and then add more complexity
like drift etc... to see where I stand. and test all those hypothesis.

**Claim**: error when you measure using a natchiappan is X not 2X

Although the TT says otherwise. The error is only shows up once.

Not sure how to write it.

---
1. 

**Claim**: You can find out the drift with an error of X with
confidence interval

If there is a static error and a random error. You can extract the
static error with uncertainty given by random error and number of
measurements.

**Claim**: Mark error adds up to caliberation error. 

**re-write claim**: Error due to caliberation of the mark

---

**Claim**: Assuming the position of the pivot point of the gripper is
constant, the effect of pick up at the PA does not affect the final
drop XY position before and after heating, as long as the temp is
constant during transfer.


---

**Claim**: The position of the pivot point affects the thermal value
over time

**re-write claim** If the position of the pivot point changes with
time, then the drift due to gripper is +ve


If pivot point moves from X1 (t1) to X2 (t2), then the change in
position of wafer at WEX between t1 and t2 is X2-X1 (roughly). This is
despite the wafer location at pick up being the exact same.
that 

---

**Claim**: Even with sensor measurement we are looking at a lost cause
to follow drift.

Current drift is at 55um. To take this out, we need 10 measurements

**Claim**: you don't need to consider Rz once you consider XY

**Claim**: coming to work is good for you?

**Claim**: Scrum works

**Claim**: it is import to come to work

**Claim**: we are not considering double counting why

Accounting for it is complicated.

Accounting for double counting of the MEtro frame and the gripper is double

**Example**: Think og the MF and the gripper. We would expect the
gripper to go from 22 to higher, while the MF can go lower or higher
than its cali temp.

Within PS, it doens't add much value? or not needs to be checked. If
Naseh confirms that they add up

What about the gripper and the PA... That can be accounted for, if
Naseh confirms that one of 22 is the minimum temperature and they both
go the expansion direction.

**Definition**: 

**Checklist**: 
 
 
---

**Claim**: Y-beam expansion is not double counting with any other part

Y-beam expansion from caliberation temperature of 22 degrees and
Metroframe expansion of 22 degrees

Y-beam and the metroframe, only one should be counted.

This is the complexit

I think it is not that complex. I can probably impliment it for the
local values atleast.

**Claim**: Calibration will give Mark Rz error


yes

**Claim**: sensor remeasuring wont work.

Sensor remeasuring will not lead to improvements in drift.

Drift keeps changeing every 15 mins by 50um

measuring


## My work: Where to work

**Claim**: We would benefit greatly from moving to our industry hub. 

Let's come back to this? later?

I cannot deny that i didn't learn from these guys. just by playing
with them, I got better in AOE. They teach you that you sshould not
have X villagers. They teach you that you need to use skirmishers for
archers. Period. 

They teach you to look at the game statistics, such as K/D ratio, such
as researches done. They look in a detail that is completely
unparalleled to mine. :) K

have ever lived and has his total touch down, total receptions, and
total receiving yards is greater than 50% compared to the second
place.

*How hard these people work compared to the rest*: 

> In team workouts he was famous for his hustle; while many receivers
> will trot back to the quarterback after catching a pass, Rice would
> sprint to the end zone after each reception. He would typically
> continue practicing long after the rest of the team had gone home.

> (His) workouts became legendary as the most demanding in the league, and

**What is DP**

It is activity designed specifically to improve performance, often
with a teacher's help; it can be repeated a lot; feedback on results
is continuously available; it's highly demanding mentally, whether the
activity is purely intellectual, such as chess or business-related
activi- ties, or heavily physical, such as sports; and it isn't much
fun.


**Claim**: What Jerry rice did is DP

**re-write Claim**: Jerry Rice designed activity to specifically
improve his performance

**Example**: 

> His weight training gave him tremendous strength. His trail running
> gave him control so he could change directions suddenly without
> signaling his move. The uphill wind sprints gave him explosive
> acceleration. Most of all, his endurance training—not something that a
> speed-focused athlete would normally concentrate on—gave him a giant
> advantage in the fourth quarter, when his opponents were tired and
> weak, and he seemed as fresh as he was in the first minute. Time and
> again, that's when he put the game away.



**Definition**:

**Checklist**: 
 

**re-write Claim**: Jerry Rice repeated those activities to improve
performance a lot.

**Example**: 

> Rice and his coaches understood exactly what he needed in order to
> be dominant. They focused on those things and not on other goals that
> might have seemed generally desirable, like speed.

**Definition**: 

**Checklist**: 
 


**re-write Claim**: not fun; demanding mentally;

> There's nothing enjoyable about running to the point of exhaustion or
> lifting weights to the point of muscle failure. But these were centrally
> important activities.

Note: Understanding what he meant with low risk and in the end writing
it out was so hard. Finding info also took equal time I think. I think
it was a sloppy way to write for him to just say low-risk and leave it
at that. And I just THINK he means the above, i.e., talking about only
the risks related to the extrapolation of the impact one RCT to
current day interventions.

 Jesus. Lots of ups and downs and fighting within myself about
delivering english vs... finally it feels like it adds up... fucking
loose ass english from these niggas high risk in what where how fuck
you.

Whether this includes how well or how uncertain GW is about the
intervention org doing its job is quite hard to extract (its a long
table and we need to be really clear about it).

lot of confusion in reading the GW table

More confusion with the definition.. damn I really doubt he knew waht
he was talking about.

not at probability of success which could be quite high

**Claim**: Hits-based forms of RD are possible.

**re-write Claim**: Recommending interventions despite the low (1-2%)
multiplier (associated with the reduction in lives saved, as a result
of the mismatch between current intervention and RCTs used), based on
CE alone happens in EA.

**Subject**: If recommending interventions despite the low multiplier
(...) happens in EA

**Predicate**: it happens.

**Example-sub**: 

CSPS is [9x cost effective than cash transfers](https://www.givewell.org/research/incubation-grants/centre-pesticide-suicide-prevention/august-2017-grant#Cost-effectiveness). Multiplier for
India is estimated to be [10% and nepal to be 60%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bVbJGuzpSldE2RaPH_XieXjnIunXlwkzJ5Q9Ec8GMp4/edit#gid=1574341664).

don't find anything that supports research.

I looked at the names of the programs and don't find anything that

**Rant**: I just realized I don't understand what RD means. 

The definition is that you recommend orgs that can *only* be tested by
RCTs. 

change only to mainly? 7 interventions all have RCTs

So Does GiveWell take this approach, apparently not with CPSP. CPSP
didn't need

Does Co-impact take this approach, Seems like it with TARL-Africa
atleast.

Because the author talks about them in the context of RD. So I will
take that thats his game.

We too used to support direct funding of interventions that can be
tested by RCTs, but now believe it is suboptimal. We will argue that
research and advocacy for growth-friendly economic policies can often
be orders of magnitude more cost-effective than direct funding of
evidence-based interventions. The case against hits-based RD is less
clear and we leave that to future work.


**Claim**: Funding of interventions that are tested by RCTs is
suboptimal

???

**Claim**: "Research and advocacy" for "growth-friendly economic
policies" can often be "orders of magnitude more cost-effective" than
"direct funding of evidence-based interventions"

**Claim**: Research and advocacy for growth is more cost-effective than directly
funding interventions tested by RCTs

**Claim**: "Economic growth" is not the best way to increase "human
welfare"

**Claim**: Research and advocacy for growth is better than randomista
development

**Claim**: There may be other ways to cost-effectively increase human welfare
outside of the constraints of RD

again thesis type posts... for the end I guess.

**Claim**: There is significant variation in income per head across
the world.

**re-write Claim**: There is significant variation in GDP per capita
across the world

**Claim**: If markets function reasonably well and people are broadly
rational, then richer people will buy more goods which have a
substantial private good element.

**re-write Claim**: In places with GDP per capita >50k USD, then
richer people will buy more goods which have a ~~substantial~~ private
good element.

**re-write Claim**: In Netherlands people earning greater than 50k USD
spend more on food, shelter, electricity, than people earning 35k USD.

**Claim**: Large cross-national differences in income per head cause
large differences in human welfare due to differential consumption of
private goods.

capita correlate with  large differences in human welfare ~~due to differential
consumption of private goods.~~

**Note**: Causation is hard to establish. so we skip it.

**Definition**: This total utility is non-excludable, as you cannot
stop someone from experiencing the joy of increasing the total utility

This does not mean that GDP is all that matters. The metric of GDP per
capita misses some crucial contributors to human welfare, including:

- Public goods: Increasing income per head reliably increases
  consumption of private goods. However, it might not necessarily
  increase public goods, such as public health interventions, clean
  air, public safety, electricity grids, sanitation, and so on.
  
- Consumption: High levels of investment increase GDP but also
  constitute foregone consumption, which involves a loss of welfare that
  is not reflected in GDP.  Leisure: High hours worked per capita
  deliver higher GDP but also constitute foregone leisure time, which
  involves a loss of welfare that is not reflected in GDP

**Claim**: The metric of GDP per capita misses some crucial
contributors to human welfare

**re-write Claim**: Increase in GDP per capita does not mean there is
an increase in production of public goods

**re-write Claim**: Increase in GDP per capita does not mean there is
an increase in government spending on healthcare per capita.

Increase in govt. spending on healthcare is a proxy for the "value you
get from govt saving lives as a result of spending on healthcare"
(which is a public good)

**Example-sub**: 

Increase in GDP per capita in India 1995 to 2014: 1565 USD to 5312 USD

Increase in population: 936m to 1.3b

Increase in GDP : 1.4T to 6.9T (multiplying I and II)

Increase in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP: 1% to 1.4%

**Claim**: There is a case where there is GDP increase and investment
increase but consumption still decreases.

**re-write Claim**: Foreign investment increase and electricity
consumption decrease happen at the same time.

**Example-sub**: Libya has decrease in GDP, decrease in investment but
still increases in consumption.

| Libya                              | 2007    | 2014    |

| GDP per capita                     | 27953   | 9736    |


And as far as India is concerned. GDP per capita increases,
Electricity consumption per capita increases despite Foreign direct
investment decreasing.


Consider Bangladesh, during 2006 to 2013 there has been "quite some"
foreign investment but still GDP increases and consumption increases.

**Claim**: It is interesting to explore how well GDP per capita
correlates with more holistic measures of welfare that try to account
for these other determinants.

You can't test this? because of "interesting". It's along the lines of
"it makes sense to do X".

**Claim**: There have been numerous attempts to build a more holistic
measure of welfare than GDP per capita

skipping... Not interested.

**Claim**: Jones' consumption equivalent welfare measure allows
comparisons across time for a given country

Isn't that like literally every other measure. Skip.

Although GDP per capita is distinct from this expanded welfare metric,
the correlation between GDP per capita and this expanded welfare
metric is very strong at 0.96, though there is substantial variation
across countries, and welfare is more dispersed (standard deviation of
1.51 in logs) than is income (standard deviation of 1.27 in logs).[9]

**Claim**:  GDP per capita is distinct from expanded welfare metric

Do we need to expand this? I mean I know the two definitions. How do
you "prove" them to be different.

**Claim**: GDP per capita is also very strongly correlated with the
Human Development Index

**Example-sub**:

income per head explains most of the observed cross-national variation
in welfare.

**Note**: No idea what "if measure such as these are accurate"
means. Does he mean that there was no data entry error? or if the data
is "representative".

**re-write Claim**: ~~If measures such as these are accurate,~~ GDP
per capita explains most of the observed cross-national variation in
welfare.

**Note**: For this I think I should look at R^2 value. As this
attempts to explain the amount of variation captured. Correlation
however appears to capture how close to the linear relationship the
plot is.

**re-write Claim**: R2 value for GDP per capita vs Welfare is greater
than 90%

**Example-sub**: Correlation was found to be 0.96. This means R2 value
is `0.96^2=92%`

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Claim**: It is a distinct question whether economic growth explains
most of the observed variation across individuals in welfare.

**Claim**: It is, however, clear that it explains a substantial
fraction of the variation across individuals.

Am puzzled these two claims are exactly the same. with the difference
being "most" and "substantial". God help me from these top writers
whom people think are extremely intelligent (highest karma points

Crucially, on the Jones and Klenow welfare metric, most developing
countries are substantially poorer than incomes suggest because of a
combination of shorter lives and extreme inequality. Lower life
expectancy reduces welfare by 15 to 50 percent in the developing
countries Jones and Klenow examine, which implies that global welfare
inequality is greater than global income inequality.[11] Therefore,
ensuring evenly shared growth and improved health is also important
for human welfare. We do not investigate the best way to do that here,
though we think that these goals are best advanced outside of the
constraints of directly funding RCT-backed interventions.

**Claim**: Some RD health interventions increase earnings and
consumption later in life, and thus do increase growth to an extent.

**re-write Claim**: Some RD health interventions "seem to" increase
earnings later in life

**Subject**: Increase in earnings, after said RD health intervention,
after a few years (>4 years).

**Predicate**: is there.

**Example-sub**: 

"Another found that four years after youths received one-time grants,
they earned 41% more on average than those who had not received
grants."

An increase of 41% compared to those who did not receive the grants,
after 4 years of receiving one-time grants.

**re-write Claim**: There is weak correlation (<0.5) for life
expectancy and GDP per capita across countries

**Example-sub**: 

Correlation of 0.81.

**Claim**: The vast majority of RD interventions are plausibly not
among the top 100 ways to increase growth

**Claim**: It is implausible that direct funding of the following
interventions is the best way to increase GDP per capita such as
malaria bednets, cash transfers etc...

**re-write Claim**: Best way to increase GDP per capita is not through
malaria bednets or cash transfers.

**Note**: The author refers to another [link](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/your-impact-evaluation-asking-questions-matter-four-part-smell-test), where it suggests 4
tests to identify if X is an "important determinant" of economic
growth. The following are the tests in "**re-write
Claim**'s"

**re-write Claim**: Developed countries have more cash transfers
than less developed countries.

**Example-sub**: 


| Country     | GDP per capita | Population |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Netherlands | 53k            | 17m        |
| Kenya       | 1.7k           | 51m        |


Netherlands has unemployment benefits (a form of cash transfer by the
govt.) for the unemployed where it pays 70% of the salary
(avg. salary=36.5k EUR). In 2018 there was an unemployment rate of
3.5%. Assuming 1% of the unemployed got the benefits, this amounts to
`17mx3.5%x70%x36.5kEURx1%`=200m USD

Regarding Kenya, GiveDirectly managed to pump only [32m](https://www.givedirectly.org/financials/) in cash
transfers. This seems to be the only monetary aid they get. There are
[no unemployment benefits](https://africapay.org/kenya/labour-laws/social-security-1/unemployment-benefits) (insurance) or other ways to get
benefits in Kenya.

**Definition**: Checks out.

transfers increase

For Netherlands, Population in 1900s was 5m. Today it is at 17m.

The reason these things (RD interventions) are unlikely to be the best
way to increase growth is that they play no role in the causal story
of the huge differences in GDP per capita across space and time.

**Claim**: they (RD interventions) play no role in the causal story of
the huge differences in GDP per capita across space and time.

**re-write Claim**: Interventions backed by RCTs are not the
reason why China rose to power

**re-write Claim**: It is not possible for healthcare expenditure alone to create the
massive rise in GDP since 1990s

**Claim**: There might be biases at play here that may cause
under-reporting of NGO assistance as a cause of escape from poverty

**re-write Claim**: There are biases at play (that may cause
under-reporting of NGO assistance).

**Failed**

**Claim**: People may naturally want to attribute their success
to their own hard work, even if NGOs did play a role

**Failed**

**Claim**: impact of some NGOs may be difficult to see, even for
beneficiaries.

**re-write Claim**: Impact of NGOs might be hard to see for
beneficiary.

For this you would need actual "impact" and "impact" according to the
beneficiary and compare them for a particular intervention.

I don't know how to answer this. So the aim is to show that measuring
"impact" is already hard for people in Science. Hence the results from
folks might not be trust worthy.

**re-write Claim**: Determining the impact of NGOs needs a lot of
people to cooperate

**Example-sub**: 

*Impact of NGOs:* Increase in average annual harvest value increases
by 76 USD for people provided with free ITNs (Insecticide Treated
Nets)

*People*: In addition to the people performing and analyzing the
survey, data from 516 farmers over 1 year was required.

**Claim**: RCT-backed interventions do no seem to explain much of the

so far "RCT-backed interventions" was being measured with estimates on
"health expenditure" and I don't know what "explain" means. They do
have a strong (>0.7) correlation. So I don't know what the author was
talking about.

I am unsure how to see this through.

I don't know how to measure RCT-backed interventions

**Failed**

**Claim**: Factors that explain the cross-national variation in GDP
per capita are: Growth-friendly policies, Geography, Natural
resources, Human Capital, Culture.

**re-write Claim**: "Growth-friendly policies" explain the
cross-national variation in GDP per capita.

**re-write Claim**: "[Trade liberalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-liberalization.asp)" explains the
cross-national variation in GDP per capita

Assuming Trade Liberalization can be measured by
"trade openness", we can look at trade openness and GDP per capita
within EU.

**re-write Claim**: Geography explains the cross-national variation in
GDP per capita

**Note** We saw earlier that TDI poorly (0.3) correlated with GDP per
capita. The paper cited about geography in "our world in data" is what
the following claim is based on.

**re-write Claim**: "Actual trade share" is strongly (>0.7) correlated with
"constructed trade share"

"constructed trade share" is a metric that factors in proximity of
different countries, countries size, area etc...

may be promising

**re-write Claim**: Within policies that seem to increase GDP per
capita, there exists some "hits-based" interventions that could save
millions of lives.

**Example-sub**: The "seeds" for increasing the yield in [Mexico
started in 1941](https://histphil.org/2016/02/08/a-practitioners-history-of-the-green-revolution/) by investment in researching and spreading
techniques to improve yield which seems to have led to them in 1956
producing enough food to feed the country.

At 1962 point we observe the GDP per capita starting to soar to never
before seen slopes from [2k USD to 14k USD today](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/maddison-data-gdp-per-capita-in-2011us?tab=chart&country=~MEX) (in roughly 70

**re-write Claim**: ~~most~~ Trade Liberalization policy change in
India cannot be tested by RCTs

For starters you need a control country which is "similar", "

there is no country similar to India w.r.t gdp per capita and
population

even similarity in states within India is tough to achieve

Many variations happen for example, we can have floods this year... population

**Note**: For RCTs, Ideally you need a control group almost exactly as
same as India. Let's call it India\*. Then you want administer the
policy intervention to India and do nothing to India\* and compare the
differences. But where are we going to get India\*? 

**re-write Claim**: (checking for similar baselines), No country is
similar to India atleast in terms of population and GDP per capita
(together)

**Example-sub**: 

The closest to India's population is from China, but it's GDP per
Capita is 5 times larger than that of India.

However.

**re-write Claim**: Interventions can be "RCT tested" within a country
by comparing "similar" groups of villages and administering
interventions to one of them.

I would like to test one part of "RCT tested". Ability to randomly
select the treatment and control villages.

**re-write Claim**: [Randomization](https://www.verywellmind.com/internal-and-external-validity-4584479#:~:text=Internal%20validity%20is%20the%20extent,alternative%20explanations%20for%20a%20finding.) (random allocation of treatment
and control groups) is achievable while testing effects of
interventions on the income of people in villages

**Subject**: Randomization, when measuring the income growth of people
upon a certain intervention 

**Predicate**: was achieved

**Example-sub**: 

In [section 1.3 of this paper](https://www.givedirectly.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/General-Equilibrium-Effects-of-Cash-Transfers.pdf), which informs the measures of
income growth of households upon cash transfer intervention, we see

**Claim**: RD might look like a plausibly effective way to reduce
poverty, because of ‘kinky poverty lines’

**re-write Claim**: RD interventions could be an effective way to
reduce poverty, if we use poverty line definition of "less than 1.9
USD a day"

"could"

**Example-sub**: 

"Globally, around $180bn is spent on aid per year—roughly $500 million
per day. There are 500 million people who are extremely poor. Assuming
that all the extreme poor have $1 per day already, we could eradicate
extreme poverty through cash transfers."

**Claim**: 500 million people are extremely poor

**re-write Claim**: 500m people are earning less than 1.9 USD/day.

**Example-sub**: 

According to [OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-in-extreme-poverty-absolute), it is 700m people as of 2015. 

([projected 2030 people](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/11/Extreme-Poverty-projection-by-the-World-Bank-to-2030-786x550.png) in poverty is 500m)

But this would raise their income by around $1 per day. And someone on
$2 per day is still very poor even if they are above the kinky $1.90
threshold. Indeed, this poverty line is discriminatory and would never
be used for citizens in a high-income country: in the US, the poverty
line is $17 per day.[19] There is no reason that such thresholds
should not apply to people outside high-income countries. On this more
expansive definition of poverty, it is very difficult for direct
funding of programmatic aid to lift people out of poverty.

**Claim**: And someone on 2 USD per day is still very poor even if
they are above the kinky 1.90 USD threshold.

**Claim**: Someone on 2 international dollars per day still cannot
even afford more than a liter of mil and 1/2 a croissant.

**Example-sub**: 

From [here](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/193310-how-is-the-global-poverty-line-derived-how-is-it), we gather that the poverty line value of
1.9 `$` is referring to international dollars

From [WHO](https://www.who.int/choice/costs/ppp/en/#:~:text=Costs%20in%20local%20currency%20units,buy%20in%20the%20United%20States.) we gather that we can multiply the international dollar
by the [PPP exchange rate](https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm) to get the local currency units.

2 USD per day translates to 1.36 euros (Netherlands). For this I will
get 1 liter of milk and 1/2 croissant. How are you supposed to live on
that. And what sort of a living would this even be? Let alone rent,
insurance and other things.

2 USD per day translates to 42rs in India. For this you can have 1l of
milk. Rent, health, education of children Who?

international poverty line is >10 times.

high-income country

**re-write Claim**: Poverty line of 1.9`$` per day is not used in high-income
countries to determine eligibility for assistance programs.

**Example-sub**: 

For one person the 2018 US guidelines suggest 12,140`$` per year as
the poverty threshold. This amounts to 33.3`$` per day.

**Definition**: checks out

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes;

**Time**: 7 mins

**Claim**: There is no reason that such thresholds should not apply to
people outside high-income countries.

Someone can say "cows fart", is the reason. How will you test it is
not. you can't test reasons. You can check facts. But you can't check
vague stuff like reasons... So waht can you test?

It's not moral 

If all lives are equal irrespective of race caste or whatever, then
the same poverty line should apply.

**re-write Claim**: skip

**Claim**: It is very difficult for direct funding of programmatic aid
to lift people out of poverty.

**re-write Claim**: Cash transfers required per year is 10 times higher
with the case of eliminating higher poverty line of 35`$` per day,
than 2`$` per day.

**Example-sub**: 

Assuming the world has 500million people in poverty. 

| Poverty threshold | additional earnings | Aid required |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| 2`$` per day      | 1`$` per day        | \~180bn      |
| 35`$` per day     | 34`$` per day       | \~6.1 tn     |


Cash transfers at 35 `$` per day would be 34 times higher assuming an
initial earnigns of 1`$` per day.

**Claim**: Indeed, median income, rather than direct anti-poverty
programmes at a given level of income, predicts nearly all of the
observed variation in poverty, at any poverty line:

**re-write Claim**: Median income predicts all of the observed
variation in poverty at all poverty lines.

**re-write Claim**: R^2 value of non-linear fit 'Median consumption'
vs 'Headcount Poverty rate' across countries with Median Annual
consumption <8000 USD, for different poverty lines (1.9, 3.2 and
5.5`$`), is greater than 90%.

**Example-sub**: 

R^2 value of 98.3 to 98.8% is observed across the three poverty lines
for a non-linear fit (-2 to power 5).

**Time**: 10-15 mins (took time to write out the claim)

**re-write Claim**: Direct anti-poverty programmes at a given level of
income, predicts all the observed variation in poverty, at any poverty
line.

**re-write Claim**: Foreign aid received ~~at a given level of
income~~ across different countries predicts the headcount poverty
rate, at any poverty line.

**re-write Claim**: R^2 value of Aid amount vs headcount poverty rate
across countries is <50%, at 1.9`$` poverty line.

**Example-sub**: There is not a direct graph on Our World In Data so,
I will take 10 countries at random, fill out their Aid and headcount
poverty rate and compute the R2 value.

**Claim**: Direct anti-poverty programmes (usually favored by
proponents of RD), aim to raise the income of the poor at a given level
of national median income.

**re-write Claim**: Cash transfers aim to increase the income of the
poor ~~at a given level of national median income~~.

**Note**: I don't know how to check the last part hence the
strike-through

**re-write Claim**: Cash transfers increase the income of the poor.

**Example-sub**:

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes;

**Time**: more than 60 mins.

**Claim**: differences across the country/years in the impact of
these targeted poverty programmes conditional on the median account
for at the very most 1.2 percent of the total cross-national variation
in poverty rates.

**Claim**: This suggests that identifying the best direct anti-poverty
programmes currently being implemented and scaling them up can at most
have very limited low-bar poverty reduction benefits, unless these can
be shown to increase national median income per head.

**Claim**: There is no reason to think that many current RD
programmes, such as cash transfers or the graduation approach,
increase national median income.

## Statistics

**Claim**: Covariance is a way to tell us something that the
individual measurements do not...

**Claim**: Covariance can classify 3 types of relationships

**Claim**: you will never calculate Covariance and be done for the
day.

**Claim**: Covariance is a computational stepping stone to correlation

**Claim**: Slope of the relationship between Gene X and Gene Y is
positive if Covariance is positive

**Claim**: Covariance value does not tell us how steep the slope of
the line is.

**Claim**: Covariance doesn't tell us if the points are far away or
close to the dotted line

**Claim**: Covariance is hard to interpret???

changes with scale..

**Claim**: Sensitivity to the scale also prevents the covariance from
telling us if the data are close to the dotted line or far from it.

**Claim**: Covariance for no trend is 0.

**Claim**: Covariance for Gene X with itself is the same thing as the
estimated variance for Gene X 

**Claim**: correlation is not sensitive to scale of the data.

## todo

- recheck claims adn rec's and give notes to help with the translation (1x)
- rate difficulty
- check for signs of should would etc...
- spell check 
- check if the **Subject**: matches the claim for each and the
  predicate too.
- check for Dollar issues
