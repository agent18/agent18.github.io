## Introduction

This is a Deliberate Practice (DP) exercise to break down statements into
testable claims. This is then tested with 1 example. 

P.S.   
The power of using at least 1 example is motivated in [this
post](/why-concrete-thinking.html). I send these DP exercises to a friend who gives me lots of
detailed feedback. Example of the feedback is shown at the end of this
Practice session.

## Essay on bottleneck

**Based on**: [Talent constrained post](/is-ea-bottlenecked-stm-2.html)

### EA orgs hiring

**Claim**: EA orgs don't seem to be able to hire the number of
*Entrepreneurs* they set out to hire, at the end of a hiring round.

**Re-write claim**: The number of people who were accepted at the end
of the year for Entrepreneurs, is less than the number of
incubees budgeted for at the beginning of the year.

**Subject**: The Number of people who were "accepted" by the end of
the year for entrepreneurs,

**Predicate**: is lesser than to the number of incubees
budgeted for at the beginning of the year.

**Example-sub**: [17 people](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship) accepted 

**Example-pred**: 10 people budgeted for "initially".

Note: It is hardly possible to see from the [budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pVLfqvE8cIQDcRKHN4L_YnFbOilLQG-dC5DtNWvLUxw/edit#gid=0) how many
people they budgeted for. But the CEO informs via mail that it was 10
"initially" for the year 2019.

> At the very start, we budgeted for 10 but moved it up to 12 after
> getting a better sense of applications eventually having in 13 in
> the program.

**Definition**: False.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; yes; ecm; Yes; s-1;

**Note/Rant**: Budgets are hard to find (let alone read). CE's budget
was hidden in a blog post which I got a hold of only after reaching
out to them. :(

Hmm. I didn't really expect the claim to be false based on what was
said initially. In the last essay I literally said that: "EA orgs
*don't* seem to be able to hire the number of *Entrepreneurs* they
want, *at the end of a hiring round*." 

> Last year we were not management, mentoring or funding constraint
> and would have let in more people if we thought more people could
> found an extremely impactful charity.

But looking at the re-written claim this is not true. The contrast is
baffling. I thought they meant one thing but I ended up with the
opposite. Dang it! English-1 Agent-0.

> EA orgs don't seem to be able to hire the number of *Researchers*
> they set out to, at the end of a hiring round.

**Claim**: EA Orgs are not able to find the people they want while
hiring Researchers.

**re-write Claim**: The number of people who were hired at EA Orgs in
Research is less than their goal for that year.

**Subject**: The number of people who were hired at EA Orgs in
Research,

**Predicate**: is less than their goal for that year.

**Example-sub**: In 2019 [7 joined GiveWell's research team](https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/).

**Example-pred**: They wanted to have [3-5 signed offer letters](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity) from new
research staff as per their goals explicitly stated in their blog.

**Definition**: 7 !\< 5. Hence false claim.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**Time**: Getting info from GiveWell's budget was the hard part.

---

**Claim**: EA Orgs don't seem to be able to hire the number of people
they want while hiring for operations.

**re-write Claim**: The number of people who were hired at EA orgs in
Operations is less than their goal for that year.

**Example-sub**: In 2019 [3 people joined the operations team of
GiveWell](https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/).

**Example-pred**: In 2019 GiveWell wanted [to hire 1 operations associate](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity).

**Definition**: 3 !\< 1. False.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**Note**: So far we checked GiveWell and Charity Entrepreneurship and
find that their goals (based on budget or explicit statements in the
blogpost) are "more than met" by the supply.

### EA orgs types and hiring

**Claim**: *Longtermism* organizations are able to find the people they
are looking for.

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at ~~Longtermism Orgs~~
MIRI is equal to or greater than their goal for that given period.

**Subject**: Number of people hired at MIRI in a given period,

**Predicate**: is equal or greater than their goal for that given period.

**Example-sub**: MIRI had 8 research staff in [Jan 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180113211347/https://intelligence.org/team/). MIRI has
[16 research staff as of Dec 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20191224082740/https://intelligence.org/team/). But, Marcello Herreshoff seems
to have left during that time and Nate Soares seems to have taken the
"leadership" role. `16-(8-2)=10`. So they did end up hiring 10 new
people.

**Example-pred**: [10 research people to be hired in 2 years](https://intelligence.org/2017/12/01/miris-2017-fundraiser/) (from 2018).

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**Disclaimer**:

According to MIRI, they were up by [8 research staff as of
2019](https://intelligence.org/2019/12/02/miris-2019-fundraiser/). It appears MIRI was looking at net population of staff, when
I reached out to them. They have one person starting February 2020 and
now another joins in May 2020. *Making it 10* delayed over 6 months.

**Time**: \>45 mins (realizing that I could look at archives)

**Claim**: *Meta orgs* are able to hire the number of people they want.

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at ~~Meta Orgs~~ OPP is
equal to or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Subject**: The number of people hired at ~~Meta Orgs~~ OPP in a
given year.

**Predicate**: is equal to or greater than their goal for that given
year.

**Example-sub&pred**: 

Unable to find more info on forecasting or budgets from OPP. And from
their website it appears they didn't have a clear idea of how many
people they wanted as GRs. They keep stating that they want to hire
["several" Generalist researchers](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities) in 2018. So we skip that.

OPP was looking for [one Director of Operations in 2018](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities). OPP hired
[Beth Jones from May 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-jones-4b16392b/).

OPP seems [to be looking for atleast 1 grants associates in
2018](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities). [Jan 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180105182929/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team) shows 2 people with that function (Grants
associate), Derek Hoph got promoted and [by Nov 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181128184458/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team) Anya Grenier
joins leading to `2-(2-1)=1` hire as they had forecasted.

**Definition**: checks out.

or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Subject**: The number of people hired at GiveWell in that given year,

**Predicate**: is equal or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Example-sub&pred**: GiveWell [2018 goals was to hire 1 head of
growth](https://blog.givewell.org/2018/04/20/givewells-outreach-and-operations-2017-review-and-2018-plans/) and in June [Ben Bateman](https://www.givewell.org/about/progress/2018-review#Outreach) started.

<!-- Regarding researchers, they admit to not having clear picture about -->
<!-- how many they wanted to hire ([Research point 6: hire flexible -->
<!-- research capacity](https://www.givewell.org/about/progress/2018-review#Outreach)) in 2018. -->

In 2019, they wanted to have [3-5 signed offer letters](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity) from new
research staff. And [7 joined their research team](https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/).

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; yes; pre; yes; ecm; yes;

**Claim**: *Animal EA orgs* are able to find the people they want.

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at Animal EA Orgs is
equal to or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Predicate**: is equal to or greater than their goal for that given
year.

**Example-sub**: 0 senior researcher were hired by the end of the year
2019 since Oct 2019 based on web archive team's page of ACE.

[2019 Oct Web archive of team](https://web.archive.org/web/20191008233423/https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/contributors/meet-our-team/)

[2020 Jan Web archive of team](https://web.archive.org/web/20200111011038/https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/contributors/meet-our-team/)


**Example-pred**: [1 senior researcher by the end of the year 2019](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/room-for-more-funding-2019/).

**Definition**: Claim is false.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**Problems**

Unable to extract proper forecasts of number of people to hire:
https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/room-for-more-funding-2019/#fn2-1-26652

Is program officer hired or needed, is not clear from the blog posts above.

Whether they hired someone or not can be found easily either through
web-archive, or through their [budgets comparing last year and this
year](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/transparency/financials/). But the forecasts are hard to come by.

---

**Claim**: The type of organizations (AI, GH&P and Meta) in EA doesn't
seem to affect whether the org can find a hire or not.

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at different types (AI,
GH&P and Meta) of EA Orgs is equal to or greater than their hiring goal for
that given year.

**Subject**:  The number of people hired at different types (AI,
GH&P and Meta) of EA Orgs in a given year.

**Predicate**: is equal to or greater than their hiring goal for that
given year.

**Example sub&pred**: As we have seen above, AI org MIRI predicted a 10 people
hire in 2 years and seemed to have exactly accomplished that. 

Meta Org OPP wanted to hire a director of operations and one grants
associate and have been successful in those endeavors by the end of
the year.

GH&P org GiveWell wanted to have 3-5 signed offers for researchers in
2017 and ended up with 7. :)

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes;

**Time**: 15 mins (coming up with the claims)

**re-write Claim**: RP do not increase their projected budget from 2019 to 2020.

**Note**: So if RP stays with the same budget in 2020 as in 2019, then
we expect that donating more money could help the
organization. Probably, they keep to the same budget as they don't
expect to get more money with fundraising.

**Example-sub**: 

RP projected budget for [2019](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6cgRR6fMyrC4cG3m2/rethink-priorities-plans-for-2019#Fundraising): 447k USD

Isn't it enough to think of 3/4th US entertainers living in LA? or
that all non-political late night shows work from in and around
California?

**re-write Claim**: More than 50% of the industry is present in one city.

**Example-sub**: [Three-fourths of the US entertainers live in LA](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/#7-consider-changing-where-you-live).

**Claim**: It matters which city you live in.

**re-write Claim**:  The things you value change, when you move to

while he was in London. (After he moved to the Silicon Valley,) Will
found out that he was doing ["merely fine"](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/) by YC standards and
started to "work harder and optimize his time even further".

Will absorbed the value that "YC standards" are to live by while he
was with Y-combinator.

**re-write Claim**: Salary at "great hubs" is higher than in
"non-hubs".

**re-write Claim**: Salary at home of headquarters of the largest
revenue Investment banks' is higher than in other places.

**Subject**: Type of people that places that have the highest
concentration from an industry, haves.

**Predicate**: highly successful people.

**re-write Claim**: Top people from outside the hub move into the
great hub.

**re-write Claim**: LA as the most number of US entertainers.

**Note**: Done already.

**re-write Claim**: Many \>10m Youtubers not originally from LA move to
LA to pursue their career.


**Example**: It has the likes of Logan Paul, Lily Singh, David Dobrik,
Liza Koshi and many more who are not originally from LA or even Cali
baby.

Logan Paul moved (with his brother Jake Paul) at a young age of 19
from Houston to LA to pursue his career of becoming a huge

hub, Many EA orgs are located in that region) informs that prior to
working there he was in Michigan and not familiar with the EA
community at all. And that when he considered leaving GiveWell after 2
years in the HUB, three of the opportunities, including the one he
accepted was enabled by his EA network. Needless to say there are
[parallels to this in other Great hubs such as LA](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/business/hollywood-apartment-social-media.html) as well.

## TIO

**Based on**: [Talent is overrated](/deliberate-practice.html) 

**Claim**: Geniuses are made not born.

**re-write Claim**: People who are atop their field trained longer and harder
than the ones that are not.

**Example**: 

*Atop their field*: Jerry Rice is known as the greatest NFL player to
have ever lived and has his total touch down, total receptions, and
total receiving yards is greater than 50% compared to the second
place.

*How hard these people work compared to the rest*: 

> In team workouts he was famous for his hustle; while many receivers
> will trot back to the quarterback after catching a pass, Rice would
> sprint to the end zone after each reception. He would typically
> continue practicing long after the rest of the team had gone home.

> (His) workouts became legendary as the most demanding in the league, and
> other players would sometimes join Rice just to see what it was
> like. Some of them got sick before the day was over

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**re-write Claim**: Geniuses are not born.

**re-write Claim**: Average hours required by the "best" and the
average hours required by the "rest" is similar to reach a particular
grade level.

**Example-sub**:  

*In the Ericsson study:*   
"The researchers calculated the average hours of practice needed by
the most elite group of students to reach each grade level, and they
calculated the average hours needed by each of the other groups. There

"Then the researchers repeated the procedure, this time with pieces
positioned not as in actual games but randomly. The non players again
could place only four or five 46 How Smart Do You Have to Be?

## Randomista development

**Based on**: [Highest Karma EA forum post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bsE5t6qhGC65fEpzN/growth-and-the-case-against-randomista-development)

**Note**: There is some fundamental confusion regarding the definition
of "RD". "RD is defined as an approach to development economics which
investigates, evaluates and recommends only interventions which "can
be tested" by randomized controlled trials (RCTs)". If you say "CAN be
tested" then I don't know how to go about testing it. I don't know
what distinguishes something as "can be tested by RD" and "cannot
be...". If you say "Is tested by RCTs" instead, then both GiveWell and
OPP don't qualify as "RD", as some of the interventions that they
offer grants to, do not have RCTs for them e.g., ["CPSP"](https://www.givewell.org/research/incubation-grants/centre-pesticide-suicide-prevention/august-2017-grant). Having
said that, the author of the blog post refers to GiveWell and Open
Philanthropy Project (OPP) in the context of "RD" multiple times, so in
many places I just substitute "RD" with GiveWell or OPP.

So basically the claim is modified as shown: "Direct funding of
interventions that ~~can be~~ *have been tested* by RCTs."
 
**Claim**: Direct funding of interventions that have been tested by
RCTs can be low-risk.

**Claim**: RD can take "low-risk forms".

**re-write Claim**: Recommending interventions which are based on RCTs,
carries high probability of success in some cases.

**re-write Claim**: Recommended interventions which are based on
RCTs, carries high (\>10%) estimated adjustment factor (e.g., for
accounting for the mismatch between RCTs and current interventions).

**Example-sub**: GiveWell recommends [Malaria Bednet Distributions](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets)
intervention. The multiplying factor is estimated to be 24%.

**Claim**: Directly funding of interventions that have been tested by
RCTs can also be high-risk.

**Claim**: RD can take "hits-based" forms.

**re-write Claim**: Recommending interventions which are based on RCTs,
carries high-risk in some cases.

**re-write Claim**: Recommended interventions which are based on
RCTs, carries low (\<10%) estimated adjustment factor (e.g., for
accounting for the mismatch between RCTs and current interventions).

**Example-sub**: GiveWell recommends [Deworming](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/07/26/deworming-might-huge-impact-might-close-zero-impact/) interventions. The
adjustment factor is estimated to be [1% in their blog post](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/07/26/deworming-might-huge-impact-might-close-zero-impact/). We
use the same method as above to come to the 1%.

**Note**: Understanding what GiveWell meant with low risk and in the
end writing it out was so hard. Finding info also took equal time I
think. The author of the blog-post just says it is low risk. But in
actuality (I checked with GiveWell too) they are talking about an
adjustment factor to account for things like "mismatch between RCTs
and current interventions". "High risk" is such a misnomer here both
in GiveWell's website and in the blog post used for this excercise.

**Claim**: EAs have *especially* focused on directly funding
interventions that have been tested by RCTs.

**re-write Claim**: EA Orgs' all recommended interventions are based on
atleast one RCT that is available on this topic.

**Subject**: The number of RCTs based on which the EA Orgs recommend
each of their interventions,

**Predicate**: is \>= 1 (per intervention recommended)

**Example-sub**: 

- GiveWell recommends [Malaria consortium](https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium#Is_SMC_an_effective_intervention) which does
  [SMC](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention). Apparently there are 7 RCTs that provide "strong evidence"
  that SMC substantially reduces.
  
- GiveWell recommends AMF which provides funding for [LLINs](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets). They
  use [a couple of RCTs](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets), for example, one on comparing mortality
  rates in children that received nets from birth to 6 months.
  
- GiveWell recommends Helen Keller's Vitamin A supplementation
  program. This is based on a [couple of RCTs](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/vitamin-A) as well.

**Definition**: Of the first 3 recommended interventions we looked
at it appears that they all use more than 1 RCT.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes;

**Claim**: However, even with direct funding programmes there is
significant variation in the probability of success.

**re-write Claim**: There is a significant variation (\>10%) in the
estimated adjustment factor (e.g., attributed to the deviation of the
RCTs from the current day interventions) across GiveWell recommended
interventions.

**Example-sub**:

**Claim**: Other GiveWell recommended programmes offer a "much more
certain" probability of impact.

**re-write Claim**: The estimated adjustment factor , is high (\>10%)
for other interventions.

**Subject**: The estimated multiplying factor (that is responsible for
the reduction in lives saved as a result of the mismatch between
current intervention and RCTs used).

**Predicate**:  are much greater than 1%.

**Example-sub**: 

GiveWell estimates the CE from which the factors are extracted.

**Claim**: GiveWell [announced](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/02/07/how-givewells-research-is-evolving/) that they will expand their
research beyond RD to include difficult-to-evaluate interventions.

**Note**: GiveWell says they are going to go "beyond empirical
research, in their announcement". "This includes more comprehensively
reviewing direct interventions in sectors where impacts are more
difficult to measure, investigating opportunities to influence
government policy, as well as other areas.". I don't think there is
any point in going further than this ATM as this is about their future
and it's only been 6 months. Are they talking about even smaller
"adjustment factors" (as seen in the beginning)? That would be one of
the ways how we can measure if the organizations are
"difficult-to-evaluate" interventions.

---

**Claim**: GiveWell's initial focus is to focus on improving public
policy.

**re-write Claim**:  GiveWell wants to focus on Global health alone and not on
economic growth.

**re-write Claim**: GiveWell is not planning to investigate
interventions that are other than GH&P.

**re-write Claim**: Interventions GiveWell plans to investigate are
only about GH&P.

**Example-sub**: Charter cities; infrastructure programs, Building
State Capability are all part of the things they want to explore.

[As per Feb 2019](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/02/07/how-givewells-research-is-evolving/) they would like to investigate the above.

**Definition**: These are not only about GH&P. Umm but some people
would argue that everything in the end is about GH&P. This claim and
example is a mistake. or atleast GH&P is ill-defined.

suboptimal.

**Note**: Didn't come as far in the blogpost so as to be able to answer it.

policies" can often be "orders of magnitude more cost-effective" than
"direct funding of evidence-based interventions".

**Claim**: Research and advocacy for growth is more cost-effective than directly
funding interventions tested by RCTs.

**Claim**: "Economic growth" is not the best way to increase "human
welfare".

**Claim**: Research and advocacy for growth is better than randomista
development.

**Claim**: There may be other ways to cost-effectively increase human welfare
outside of the constraints of RD.

**Note**: The above are dealt with through this excercise.

### Econ growth

**Claim**: Economic growth explains a substantial fraction of the
variance in human welfare today.

**re-write Claim**: GDP per capita correlates with "expanded welfare
metric".

**Claim**: There is significant variation in income per head across
the world.

**re-write Claim**: There is significant variation in GDP per capita
across the world.

**re-write Claim**: There is variation in orders of magnitude in GDP
per capita across the world.

**Example-sub**: US GDP 2016 is 53000`$`. India's is at 5000`$` (one
order smaller than US). Democratic republic of Congo is at 836`$` (2
orders smaller than US).

**Claim**: The metric of GDP per capita misses some crucial
contributors to human welfare.

**re-write Claim**: Increase in GDP per capita does not mean there is
an increase in production of public goods.

**re-write Claim**: Increase in GDP per capita does not mean there is
an increase in government spending on healthcare per capita.

**re-write Claim**: Increase in GDP per capita and increase in
government spending on healthcare per capita do not happen at the same
time.

**re-write Claim**: Higher hours of work per capita implies there is
going to be higher GDP, for countries with GDP per capita (from 30k to
40k).

**Example-sub**: 

From 1980 to 2000,

We see cases where there is decrease in 'abs. change in hrs per week'
but still the GDP per capita increases.

supply increases.

**re-write Claim**: Increase in "utility" of a good diminishes, as
"supply increases"

**re-write Claim**: ~~Increase~~ Difference in "amount you are willing

With the first pizza I am willing to pay 15 euros. If there is an
offer of some sort to get extra pizza I will consider it, so that I
can save it for future in my freezer. If they are giving me 7 more
pizzas for 7 euros, I couldn't care less as I can't eat it or store
it. This often happens when I buy from Subway... When there is an offer.

**Claim**: Individuals get diminishing marginal utility from income

**re-write Claim**: "Utility" from (additional income)[2], declines as
(income increases)[3].

**Note**: what is this utility, and how do we measure it? Happiness
quotient? Money spent on outside food? I think that is the main
problem.

**Note**: the value of 2 dollars when I didn't have a job was really
high as I would refuse to spend it on anything. Going for a 10 euro
lunch was blasphemy and spending 20 euros for dinner was outrageous.

**re-write Claim**: Amount of money you spend per month for food and
shelter, increases with increase in salary.

**Example-sub**: 

When I earned 0k, My total expenses for rent, food and drinks was 600-800

**Claim**: It is "interesting" to explore how well GDP per capita
correlates with more holistic measures of welfare that try to account
for these other determinants.

**Note**: You can't test this? because of "interesting". It's along
the lines of "it makes sense to do X"?

**Claim**: There have been numerous attempts to build more holistic
measures of welfare than GDP per capita.

**re-write Claim**: There have been \>10 attempts to build "more

**Claim**: ~~Even though there is high correlation~~ There is
substantial variation across countries.

**Note**: I don't think the author of the blogpost is talking about
the variation in GDP per capita across different countries. I think
the is talking about the countries that are still far away from the
correlation line and countries that are spot on, on the correlation
line.

**re-write Claim**: Difference in Predicted welfare and plotted
welfare (actual welfare metric of Jones'), across countries is
"substantial" (atleast one order of magnitude larger).

**Example-sub**: 

Based on graph [figure 7](https://www.nber.org/papers/w16352.pdf). Values are in logs and with respect to
US GDP and Welfare.

| Country  | GDP per Cap | pred. welfare | Act. welfare | diff.% \* |

| Portugal | 1/2         | 1/2           | 1/2          | 0%        |
| Botswana | 1/4         | 1/4           | 1/32         | 700%      |
\*diff is calculated as "Act. welfare - Pred. welfare" in terms of
"Act. welfare"

**Definition**: In one case it is 0% difference and in the other case
it is 700%. checks out as substantial.

in welfare.

**Note**: No idea what "if measure such as these are accurate"
means. Does he mean that there was no data entry error? or if the data
is "representative"? All of which I am not sure how to check.

**Failed**

**re-write Claim**: ~~If measures such as these are accurate,~~ GDP
per capita explains most of the observed cross-national variation in
welfare.

**Note**: For this I think I should look at R^2 value. As this
attempts to explain the "amount of variation captured" in a
variable. Correlation however appears to capture how close to the
linear relationship the plot is.

**re-write Claim**: R2 value for GDP per capita vs Welfare is greater
than 90%.

**Example-sub**: Correlation was found to be 0.96. This means R2 value
is `0.96^2=92%`, for the year 2007.

**Claim**: It is a distinct question whether economic growth explains
most of the observed variation across individuals in welfare.

**Claim**: It is, however, clear that it explains a substantial
fraction of the variation across individuals.

**Note**: Am puzzled for at the outset these two claims appear to be
exactly the same. With the difference being "most" and
"substantial". Is this "bad" writing according to an STM? (Highest

differentiate between causation and correlation? Athukunu ipdiya?

advanced outside of the constraints of directly funding RCT-backed
interventions.

**re-write Claim 1**: Increasing life expectancy of a country are
~~best~~ advanced outside the constraints of directly funding
RCT-backed interventions.

**re-write Claim**: Life expectancy increase due to malaria aid in a

**Claim**: 60 years of public health improvements since 1950 increase
cross-national life expectancy on average by around 8 years.

**re-write Claim**: Cross-national life expectancy on average has
increased by 8 years over 60 year time period since 1950.

**Note**: A bit time consuming to compute life expectancy on average
in libre calc for 60 years so modified to check for a few examples.

**Claim**: GDP per capita is very strongly associated with poverty
reduction, on "standard low-bar poverty thresholds".

**Note**: Tried getting the data from as pointed by the author but it
was taking too much time, hence I don't show correlation.

**re-write Claim**: Headcount poverty rate (as a % of total pop)
decreases with increase in "Median PPP annual income/consumption",

**Claim**: The vast majority of RD interventions are plausibly not
among the top 100 ways to increase growth.

**Note**: Don't' know where such a tier list exists. 

**Note**: There is a way to compare RD intervention that has evidence
of increasing income, and "growth accelerations" in GDP per
capita. This is dealt with towards the far end of this excercise.

**Claim**: It is implausible that direct funding of the following
interventions is the best way to increase GDP per capita such as
malaria bednets, cash transfers etc...

**re-write Claim**: Best way to increase GDP per capita is not through
malaria bednets or cash transfers.

**Note**: The author refers to another [link](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/your-impact-evaluation-asking-questions-matter-four-part-smell-test) for the above claim,

determinant" of economic growth. The following are the tests in
"**re-write Claim**'s".

than less developed countries.

| Kenya       | 1.7k           | 51m        |


Netherlands has unemployment benefits (a form of cash transfer by the
govt.) for the unemployed (for a certain period) where it pays 70% of
the salary (avg. salary=36.5k EUR). In 2018 there was an unemployment
rate of 3.5%. Assuming 1% of the unemployed got the benefits, this
amounts to `17mx3.5%x70%x36.5kEURx1%`=200m USD.

Regarding Kenya, GiveDirectly managed to pump only [32m](https://www.givedirectly.org/financials/) in cash
transfers. This seems to be the only monetary aid they get. There seem
to be [no unemployment benefits](https://africapay.org/kenya/labour-laws/social-security-1/unemployment-benefits) (insurance) or other ways to get
benefits in Kenya.

**Claim**: The role of direct programmatic assistance in explaining
the variance in economic outcomes is mirrored in surveys of people who
have moved out of poverty.

**re-write Claim**: Role of interventions in improving incomes of
people out of poverty (1.9 USD/day) is poor.

**re-write Claim**: Average income before intervention is \<1.9 USD/day
and after intervention is still less than \<1.9 USD/day.

**Example-sub**: 

For the Graduation Programme cited here to "bring people out of
poverty" ([Source: Table 1](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~cru2/pdf/Science-2015-TUP.pdf)), in Pakistan people with salary of
\<1.74 USD/day were accepted.

**Note**: Assuming consumption if higher, then income is higher.

 Non-durable annual consumption "as a result of the program per
household" = 451 USD PPP. Assuming 2 people even per household, this
becomes `451/365/2=0.61$` PPP per day.

### What does explain cross-national differences in GDP per capita?

> Thus, many RCT-backed interventions do not seem to explain much of
> the cross-national variation in GDP per capita. What does? There are
> a range of factors including: Growth-friendly policies, Geography,
> Natural resources, Human Capital, Culture.

**Claim**: RCT-backed interventions do not seem to explain much of the
cross-national variation in GDP per capita.

so far "RCT-backed interventions" was being measured with estimates on
"health expenditure". They do have a strong (\>0.7) correlation. So I
don't know what the author was talking about. 

**Failed**

**Claim**: Factors that explain the cross-national variation in GDP
per capita are: Growth-friendly policies, Geography, Natural
resources, Human Capital, Culture.

**re-write Claim**: "Growth-friendly policies" explain the
cross-national variation in GDP per capita.

**re-write Claim**: "[Trade liberalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-liberalization.asp)" explains the
cross-national variation in GDP per capita.

Assuming Trade Liberalization can be measured by "trade openness", we
can look at trade openness index and GDP per capita within EU.

**re-write Claim**: EU countries Trade Openness Index is strongly
correlated with GDP per capita.

**Example-sub**:

**Claim**: Within growth-friendly policies generally, some hits-based
forms of RD may be promising.

**re-write Claim**: Within policies that seem to increase GDP per

compare the differences. But where are we going to get India\*?

**re-write Claim**: (checking for similar baselines), No country is
similar to India atleast in terms of population and GDP per capita
(together).

**re-write Claim**: Interventions can be "RCT tested" within a country
by comparing "similar" groups of villages and administering
interventions to one of them.

**Note**: I would like to test then, one part of "RCT tested": Ability
to randomly select the treatment and control villages.

**re-write Claim**: [Randomization](https://www.verywellmind.com/internal-and-external-validity-4584479#:~:text=Internal%20validity%20is%20the%20extent,alternative%20explanations%20for%20a%20finding.) (random allocation of treatment

**Claim**: RD might look like a plausibly effective way to reduce
poverty, because of ‘kinky poverty lines’.

**re-write Claim**: RD interventions could be an effective way to
reduce poverty, if we use poverty line definition of "less than 1.9
USD a day".

**Note**: based on the example the author gives, it appears he is
checking if we can get eradicate poverty if we use the 1.9 USD per
day poverty line.

**re-write Claim**: Available aid minus Aid (without losses in cash
transfer) required to increase the income of below poverty line people
to above poverty line, is \>0.

**Example-sub**: 

*[Example from the blogpost](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bsE5t6qhGC65fEpzN/growth-and-the-case-against-randomista-development#Excursus_on_kinky_poverty_lines)*: "Globally, around 180bn USD is spent
on aid per year—roughly 500 USD million per day. There are 500 million
people who are extremely poor. Assuming that all the extreme poor have
1 USD per day already, we could eradicate extreme poverty through cash
transfers."

- Assuming a 1`$` per day already with the poor people and no losses
in cash transfer of the aid reaching people. 700mn people are below
poverty as of 2015. So we have `700mn x 1$x 365 = 255bn`.

- Total Available Aid per year amounts to [180bn](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bsE5t6qhGC65fEpzN/growth-and-the-case-against-randomista-development#Excursus_on_kinky_poverty_lines)`$`.

**Claim**: And someone on 2 USD per day is still very poor even if
they are above the kinky 1.90 USD threshold.

**Claim**: Someone on [2 international dollars per day](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/193310-how-is-the-global-poverty-line-derived-how-is-it) still cannot
even afford more than a liter of milk and 1/2 a croissant.

From [WHO](https://www.who.int/choice/costs/ppp/en/#:~:text=Costs%20in%20local%20currency%20units,buy%20in%20the%20United%20States.) we gather that we can multiply the international dollar
by the [PPP exchange rate](https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm) to get the local currency units.

2 USD per day translates to 1.36 euros (Netherlands). For this I will
get 1 liter of milk and 1/2 croissant. How are you supposed to live on
that per day. And what sort of a living would this even be? Let alone
rent, insurance and other things.

2 USD per day translates to 42rs in India. For this you can have 1l of
milk. Rent, health, education of children Who?

**Claim**: This suggests that identifying the best direct anti-poverty
programmes currently being implemented and scaling them up can at most
have very limited low-bar poverty reduction benefits, unless these can
be shown to increase national median income per head.

**Note**: We can only comment on what is observed. What is observed is
for a given median annual consumption the head count poverty rate
doesn't vary too much (15% max). But this variation at a given
consumption is lower (around 3% max) for poverty rates in the order of
35 to 50%, which is where Give Directly does its cash transfers
intervention. So if we look at a median consumption around 750 units
in the same graph [Figure 3](https://d101vc9winf8ln.cloudfront.net/documents/32264/original/RCTs_and_the_big_questions_10000words_june30.pdf?1565974982), then we see \<5%.

**re-write Claim**: Differences in headcount poverty rate observed at a
constant median annual consumption of 750 units is \<20%.

**Example-sub**: 

At 750 units of median consumption, we see that the headcount poverty
rate of line 1.9`$` is less than 5%.

**Claim**: There is no reason to think that many current RD
programmes, such as cash transfers or the graduation approach,
increase national median income.

same if there is cash transfer or not. Don't have direct data atleast.

### From the paper

[Paper](https://d101vc9winf8ln.cloudfront.net/documents/32264/original/RCTs_and_the_big_questions_10000words_june30.pdf?1565974982).

> This of course doesn’t mean that other factors like the change in

> difference or even that they cannot in principal make a
> “substantial” difference, it just says that empirically, relative to

The part on "inequality" is being skipped as that is not what I want
to test in this paper.

**Claim**: Relative to (the massive changes associated with the change
in the median)[1], the (differences at a given level of consumption)[2] are
very modest compared (to the gains from growth)[3].

**Note**: These are some of the most convoluted sentences I have ever
seen.  After half an hour of pondering over this sentence, I think I
get it... I think "relative to [1]" and then "compared to [3]" seems
to mean the same thing. There are also typos (closure of brackets
missing) which make me wonder what sort of publication this is. I
suspect this "paper" was even proof read.

**re-write Claim**: Relative to [1], [2] of the poverty headcount
rate, compared to changes in poverty headcount rate when median
consumption changes, is very modest (\>10%).

**Example-sub**: 

![figure3-pritchet](./images/claims/figure3-pritchet.png)

[1] --\> If median annual consumption changes from 0 to 8000 units then
headcount poverty rate goes from 100% to 0%.

[2] --\> At any median annual consumption, for 1.9`$` poverty line, the
variation of headcount poverty rate is at max 15%.

changes in poverty headcount rate when median consumption changes --\>
It seems to be the same as [1]. 

**Definition**: Checks out that [2] is modest based on the empirical
evidence.

**Claim**: The Ultra Poor Graduation program gets people out of
extreme poverty via livelihood training, productive asset transfers,
etc...

**re-write Claim**: Average income for all countries in the
Graduation program year graduation program is \<1.9`$` PPP per day.

**Example-sub**:

For Pakistan the eligibility criteria is \<1.74`$` PPP. But for
Honduras the eligibility criteria seems to be \<2.18`$` PPP per day
(67.82`$`/31). For other countries, it's not even based on income.

**Note** Average income not available. So we look at consumption due
to the program. If it is greater than 1.9`$` PPP per day.
 
**re-write Claim**: Consumption per person "attributed to the
program over the control" is \> 1.9`$` PPP per day.

**Example-sub**: 

Let's take Pakistan and in third year (one year after the stopping of
the intervention):

Non-durable annual consumption "as a result of the program per
household" = 451 USD PPP.

Assuming 2 people even per household, this becomes `451/365/2=0.61$`
PPP per day.

**Claim**: Per person "benefits of growth accelerations" are orders of
magnitude greater than the per-person potential impact of graduation
programme.

**re-write Claim**: GDP per capita increase due to the "Black-box
growth acceleration" is one order of magnitude higher than potential
GDP per capita increase of graduation programme.

**Note**: The following example as given in blog post and elaborated
by me the first time is a BIG FAIL for the above claim. Benefits are
compared but not for same costs. Sad part is I said it checks out the
first time. And realized about it while re-reading it. I then edit the
claim so that atleast the example matches the claim.

**Failed**

**re-write Claim**: GDP per capita increase due to "growth
acceleration" from 1967 to 1980 (irrespective of the cost it took to
get there), is one order of magnitude higher, than potential GDP per
capita increase of graduation programme for a cost of 1bn `$`.

**Note**: The above claim compares GDPPC increase in graduation
programme for 1bn `$` and "black-box growth accelerations" (not per
1bn `$`). This is what the author seems to be saying, and the
following just tests that. I understand that this is a bullshit
comparison.

**Example-sub**:

- Potential GDP per capita increase of graduation programme in Ethiopia:

 - Dollars in benefit to cost ratio is 1.6 times on average. ([Table 4
  line 11](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~cru2/pdf/Science-2015-TUP.pdf))

 - Ethiopian population is 100 million.

 - Investing 1billion USD *could* get a per capita increase of 16`$` per
  year.

- Whereas GDP per capita increase due to "black-box growth acceleration"
in the past for Brazil in 1967.

 - "Per capita gain per annum in NPV of GDP from a single large growth
acceleration" = 551`$` in Brazil around 1967 ([Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999316300311)).

Need to further break down "number of 'good quality' people". Are we
talking about (a) the number of people in the world with a certain
level of qualification (say, PhD in Economics and 2 years of work
experience), whether or not they work in one of the EA organizations,
(b) the number of people who applied for a particular job posting, or
(c) the number of people who were hired?

(What is this "quality" you speak of?)

What they say and think about the number of candidates fit for the job
is different from the number of people hired or the other claims we
saw above. Stick to one claim at a time. See what happens when you
don't try to test the claim "holistically".

short on cash"? "affected by funding"? "ability to immediately deploy
available talent is weak"?

Unfortunately, my dictionary is defective and seems to have omitted
those words, so I'm having a hard time following this.

How are you supposed to test the claim that someone is "short on
cash"? He didn't hire a million people? Even Bill Gates didn't hire a
million people.

Contrast that to: this year's hiring budget. Even if that number is
not directly available, you could look at related numbers like last
year's expenditure on salaries and other overhead, last year's funds
raised, and thus whatever surplus amount they have for hiring this
year (this is one way people may decide their hiring budget; they may
also look at their projected funds raised this year, etc.). Example:
MIRI budget breakdown -
https://intelligence.org/2019/12/02/miris-2019-fundraiser/.

So, one way to look at claims of "funding-constrained" is to see the
growth in budget and check if there was a surplus compared to last
year and if more of that went into hiring new employees or if it went
into higher salaries for existing employees, administrative costs
(like managers or accountants), and higher rent for a bigger office.

Why does this matter? If someone's projected budget is not higher than
last year's, then he probably doesn't have much budget for hiring new
employees. In that case, I would predict that donating more would
probably lead to more hires and thus hopefully more impact (SST). But
if his projected budget is higher and he still doesn't allocate much
for new hires, then I wouldn't expect to see more donations to lead to
more hires and more I-word. Much of that money might go into higher
salaries or a bigger office (which may or may not lead to less I-word
but will probably be different from that for new hires).

This is answering a different kind of question from the question for
this section. This is about "does the age of the organization affect
how much they 'seem to want money'?" But the question for this section
was "are they 'short on cash'?" #SeparateThyClaims

Lovely. Keep up the great work, Mr. Agent. 3.6 hours per day calls for
a nice celebration (alcohol or whatever you prefer as a treat). Here's
to several thousand hours more.

*****

Mission #7: Here's your mission, should you choose to accept it - take
up some passage that has **confused** you (could be about work, politics,
EA, or AI), narrow down its claims, and test them with one concrete
example each. The **output dimensions** for each claim would be whether
you have a concrete example for the subject and the predicate and
whether the example actually talks about the same thing as the claim
(survey vs acceptance rate).

The twist is that you have to rewrite the sentence till the claims
without concrete examples are gone. For example, "we are short on
cash" will become "we have zero budget for new hires this year" plus
example.

## Important takeaways

So we have the **claim**, "GiveWell don't seem to be affected by
funding while hiring researchers". Let's say it is expected to test
this against **EE** and not with statements such as: "OPP didn't want
to hire in that round because of ...". Then, I see the problem. I
can't test the statement. SS Hurts.

Let's try another,

**Claims**: GiveWell "don't want" to hire more researchers ~~not
because of funding issues~~ despite "having enough funding".

**Note**: Even this is not good. SS is still hurting like hell "don't
want to hire more researchers", "despite having enough funding".

**re-write Claim**: GiveWell do not allocate more ~~funding~~ money in
budget than previous year for hiring, despite allocating "more" funds
to other things like bigger office, higher salaries etc...

**Note**: This seems to be testable by checking budget as an STM has
informed. *Ufff! that took time to get to.*

**re-write Claim**: GiveWell does not allocate more money in budget
than previous year for hiring.

**Example-sub**: 

GiveWell 2019 salary expenses: 3.1m USD

GiveWell 2018 salary expenses: 1.9m USD

**Lessons**: Make claims testable by removing the fluff ("affected by
funding"). Agent is struggling with complicated claims ("affected by
funding"). As soon as you change that complicated part, you can modify
the claim to make it testable (as shown above). 

## Notes to an STM

I assumed we don't talk about anything less than 200 claims. The above
format is what I try to keep up with along this excercise:

- Main claims --\> "**Claim**:"  

- sub claims --\> "**re-write Claim**:" 

- sub claims rewritten --\> **re-write Claim**: 

- Line donates the end of a "**Claim**:", not a "**re-write Claim**:" 

- All "Because" claims are skipped as that is not the goal
  here. "Because" is removed and the claim is treated regularly. 
  
  For e.g.,
  
  **Claim**: Most developing countries are substantially poorer than
incomes suggest because of a combination of shorter lives and extreme
inequality.

	**re-write Claim**: Most developing countries are "substantially
poorer" than incomes suggests.

	**re-write Claim**: "developing countries" life expectancy is "low"
compared to "developed countries"

	etc...

- Have not answered claims about the future with "might", "would",
  "could". Please let me know at the claim itself if I could have done
  better.
  
- What all counts as **EE**, Calculations counts as EE?
  Cost-effectiveness Calcs from GiveWell (?)
