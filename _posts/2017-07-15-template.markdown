## Mission #9. 

**Mail dated Aug 13,**

Great job on spending 29 hours in a week! *I recommend measuring rate
of phrases per hour.*

Overall, I didn't see you take on Superintelligence, which was the
mission. Please work on either that or stuff you feel *confused*
about. *Only failures matter* (apart from maintenance of existing
performance).

Note down patterns of failure, such as "X prefers A to B". Spend, say,
half your time searching for and practicing on examples of those
types. You can spend the rest of your practice time on new examples,
from which you will hopefully find other patterns of failure.

**Mail dated June 24,**

Mission #9: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
concretely analyze the key claims in the book Superintelligence by
Nick Bostrom (the book mentioned in the Elon Musk tweet above). He's a
PhD at Oxford who's been writing about AI safety along with guys like
Eliezer for nearly two decades. The book has detailed arguments and
examples about all the topics like possible paths to
"superintelligence" (whatever that means), types of
"superintelligence", the control problem, etc.

No need to write "Question: " - doesn't seem to have changed your
answers.

Don't have to go sentence by sentence; *look at one key claim for each
section, usually the one in the first few paragraphs*, or one for each
paragraph if you feel it's an important section. For example:

> CHAPTER 2 Paths to superintelligence
>
> Machines are currently far inferior to humans in general
> intelligence. Yet one day (we have suggested) they will be
> superintelligent. How do we get from here to there? This chapter
> explores several conceivable technological paths. We look at
> artificial intelligence, whole brain emulation, biological
> cognition, and human-machine interfaces, as well as networks and
> organizations. We evaluate their different degrees of plausibility
> as pathways to superintelligence. The existence of multiple paths
> increases the probability that the destination can be reached via at
> least one of them.

The key claim is "How do we get from here to there? Answer: Artificial
intelligence, whole brain emulation, ..."

Feedback checklist:

1. Could it be that this claim has no any example at all? For example,
   "civilization is at stake".

2. Could this claim be false? Remember the "there is no doubting"
   example.

3. Does this claim say anything about "best" (need to compare against
   the entire set) or "most" (need to show it's the majority in the
   set) or "no" (need to show that nothing in the set matches)?

4. Did you stick to examples that are in the chapter itself? That way
   you don't have to search online for too long.

5. Did you use a running example for a technical phrase? There will be
   lots of new phrases in the book, like "convergent instrumental
   value" and "orthogonality thesis". Whenever you see them, you
   should recall whatever running example you've used.

6. If this is an "if-then" claim, did you either get a concrete
   example or mark it as having no example?

Short names: none; false; best; chapter; running; if-then.

Please refer to the checklist after every claim analysis to ensure
you're not making old mistakes. If you want to add to the checklist
based on mistakes found in past feedback, that's great.

## Feedback list used in this essay

## Chapter 1

one key claim per section
For now I don't know which are my failures. 

In an attempt to keep the fire going. I would like to focus on 10
phrases an hour?

Let's see how that goes and refine this shit accordingly. I am
ready. Pandindian pandian.

- black for claims
- red for examples
- blue for conclusions
- yellow highlight for other "interesting stuff"

### Growth modes and big history (2;3)

> (History at the largest scale)[1], seems to exhibit (a sequence of
> distinct growth modes)[2], each much more rapid than (its predecessor)[3].

**Claims**: [1] seems to exhibit [2], each much more rapid than [3].

**Subject**: [2] exhibited in [1].

**Predicate**: much more rapid than [3]. 

**Example**: "A few hundred thousand years ago, in early human (or
hominid) prehistory, growth was so slow that it took on the order of
one million years for human productive capacity to increase
sufficiently to sustain an additional one million individuals living
at subsistence level. By 5000 bc, following the Agricultural
Revolution, the rate of growth had increased to the point where the
same amount of growth took just two centuries. Today, following the
Industrial Revolution, the world economy grows on average by that
amount every ninety minutes."

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; chapter; not-running; none  


### Great expectations (2)

> (Machines matching humans in general intelligence)[1]—that is, possessing
> com- mon sense and an effective ability to learn, reason, and plan
> to meet complex information-processing challenges across a wide
> range of natural and abstract domains—have been expected since (the
> invention of computers in the 1940s)[2].

**Claims**: [1] has been expected since [2].

**Subject**: When [1] has been expected

**Predicate**:  since [2].

**Example**: *No example of someone expecting in 1940.*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; N/A; none; not-chapter; not-running; none  

> From the fact that some individuals have overpredicted artificial
> intelligence in the past, however, it does not follow that AI is
> impossible or will never be developed.

**Claims**: 



> The main reason why progress has been slower than expected is that
> the technical difficulties of constructing intelligent machines have
> proved greater than the pioneers foresaw.

### Seasons of hope and despair (6)

### State of the art (7)

### opinions about the future of machine intelligence (4)


## Notes

- I feel that I am not taking too seriously every single sentence,
  unless it is claims of importance.. For example they talk abotu IJ
  GOOd an what he expects to happen in the future. 
  
  Who cares? What are the claims? are there examples for it? moving on!
