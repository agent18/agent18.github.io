First impressions:

What an opportunity. If you would want someone to not die, if there is something you can do about it, and if they indeed "die" why not freeze them. If elizer yudkowsky, STM and so many other mahaans, beleive that there is a possibility, why not! 

It seems to be in coherance with the idea that if death causes pain, and you don't want death, you wan't to save as many lives as you can, then why not freeze, if it is economically viable.

#### **Prolity!**
