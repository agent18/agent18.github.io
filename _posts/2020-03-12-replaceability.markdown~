## Entry question and Claims Claims Claims 

80khours saying it is better to work at eao than do ETG.


How much ETG for a GR at Open Phil, Rethink Charity, TLYCS, GiveWell?

How much ETG for AI strategy policy person?

How much ETG for editor types?

How much ETG AI safety positions?

How much ETG for management positions in any org?

First year alone?

What about life time?

Of course this begs the question if onvr I knw this, these numbers
will also make sense for me. Emmm... They will make sense for me if
I am able to get the job there. I assume making it to the top is
already a big deal. And it is not clear how much of the impact you
actually make. So lets gets the daaaaay staaaarted waaaat....

I am trying to look at what people typically are and trying to see if
the climb the steep hill is even worth it?

## What do you need to determine how much ETG? 

- how replaceable it is

- spillover effects (aka displacement chain) how big it is

- amount of dollars moved/raised by the org

- % of contribution to you vs donar

- % contribution within the org associated to you

## Open Phil

Some of the hardest things to estimate would be Open replaceability
and spill over effects.



## Introduction

Jobs are not TC. great. But how replaceable are there... how far do
the displacements go until... 

What is the value of working in EA vs ETG 5 examples spanning the
different things.... 

What can you do? Ask the organizations them selves which is a bullshit
advice... because orgs are super busy and wern't able to help me out. 

## TC

TC is not true, atleast I barely know of cases where a position is
TC. 

## Why replaceability

Whether an org is TC or not, has implications on the impact made. The
true impact you make when a job is TC at an EA org is (much) higher,
than when the job is not TC. A junior GR at GiveWell is expected to
move 2.4m<span>$</span> if the job was TC. The same GR is expected to
move only [244k](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#but-wont-i-be-replaceable) in the case that the hired GR is better than the
next-best-candidate by 10% (Not TC). Such is the distinction between
being TC and not. 

So what is this replaceability and how do we come about it?

Say there is only one EAO and they have an opening. Peter and Jay are
the only people "worthy" of that job. Peter can produce a value of
500k at that EAO and Jay can produce a value of 400k at that job. 

If Peter gets the job the value for the world is 500k. If Peter sits
on his ass at home and masturbates and B takes the job, then the value
for the world is 400k. So when Peter takes up a job and doesn't he
only makes the world better by 100k and that is his value. 

You are only as good as you are better than the last candidate. 

The above is a very simple case, where Jay doesn't take up any other
job or where there is only one EAO and one job and not many more like
Jay. These also influence what is the impact. 

So let's say there are a dozen jobs then what happens?

Peter creates 500k value, and then Jay creates 400k value and then
what we see is that there is 900k value. 

There are not many GR openings (5 in Open Phil in 2018). And 100s of
applicants applied for such a position. Not sure what to make of the
English... The current situation feels like there are not many places
those 100s can go. Let's say another 5 could go to? Maybe they go to
other places and create impact and then the ones left over are people
like me and there are many of them... all claims... Like how will I
get far with determining this ? This seems like I can't do shit about
it. 


Maybe I can say as peter suggested that it is between this and
that... this being one person and the other guy turned off? and that
being there are plenty of jobs 

The spectrum is somewhere between the second best not getting the job
and everyone in line getting a job because it is TC. But we all know
that is not true. 

You wont get into EA... It is so FULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL.

Level 1 thinking... Level 2 thinking 

Its so hard to get values such as what would be your contribution? 


Level 1 thinking and Level 2 thinking:

Level 1 thinking is when it is TC (which it clearly is not), and level
2 thinking is when it is 

## Comparing two different interventions...

Comparing ETG to where and a GR at GiveWell...

Should I donate to a priority cause? or give to GiveWell? 

So then the discussion is how much you move (under level 1 and level 2
thinking)  

GiveWell does RCTs and ensures weather an org is worthy or not. So it
is the only org that has estimates on where ETG can best go... ETG to
valliammai polytech and ETG

**Claims**: there are more people responsible for the impact than just
the donor and the grants researcher.

**Example**: When you give money to GiveWell, you naturally share
impact. The grants researcher will have some impact as he is the one
who guides your money. This money is guided to say AMF, where there
are 2 people and many volunteers working, who will claim some impact
for guiding the money to buy nets... are there other poeple getting
money from here? salary of the employee?

There are so many people and it would be naive to assume that it is
only the GR and donor who share the impact. 

**Definition**: check 

**Checklist**: 
 
**Claims**: You can compare ETG to working at an EAO

**Example**:  Let's take working at GiveWell as a scene and donating
to GiveWell.

I could donate 50k to GiveWell. In 2015 Milan Griffes estimates 2m
moved by him. And a good chunk went to AMF probably. 

Donor comes with 113m. Org costs say take up a few million and
givewell reports moving 110m

- Donor (60%)
- GiveWell (20%)
  - GR (0.2%)
	- replaceability (10%)
	- actual impact (2%)
  - other people
	- replaceability (x%)
	- actual impact (98%)
- Intervention master (AMF evidence aravind action) (20%)
  - employees
  - employers 
  - Org costs?
  
A donation of 50k will lead to 30k impact. GiveWell moved 110k donated
dollars in 2015 of which the GR Junior could be associated with
(0.2%). Of this 0.2% moved only 20% is associated with the
employee. So I think a GiveWell employee would contribute 0.04%. This
implies that in 2015 junior GR moved 44k. So working at GiveWell being
10% better than the last hire in a level 1 assumption is still better
than donating 50k. Interesting... Impact wise.... and this number
could only be higher as it moves towards the TC assumption.

Anyways this is GiveWell...

I am wondering whether salary of the GR should also come in the
picture. Operations costs... As per the impact, it is split between
diff orgs. Not as per the cost. Regarding replaceability of the org
itself, I think it is hard to estimate. Am more inclined to the level
0 thinking in this case. If GiveWell is removed then are there other
organizations that can do the job? not yet.. but also maybe because
GiveWell is alive. 

Is GiveWell replaceable? If it is then I need to take it into
account. As I have split GiveWell into people and their contribution,
it doesn't seem to bother my part of the contribution. I claim that
because the replaceability is brought to a personal level it doesn't
affect me. 

For example if there is as good of a person working available instead
of holden enbadhadi shoulder then if holden doesn't work he then the
other person takes care of the work. So this doesn't affect GiveWell's
output. I look at it as GiveWell has 110k to distribute. That is
replaceability on a personal level. So if donors didn't have giveWell
what would he do? he would probably spend on the best guesses he can
make. So what is the contribution of GiveWell when it is there - when
it is not there, in terms of output... Insanely hard to
calculate... And I don't have any resources to do it. 


**Claims**: It is fair to compare ETG to GiveWell with working at GiveWell

I don't know what it is fair means. 

but I can do the following: 

**Example**: ETG of say 50k to GiveWell (donor), say 50% goes to donor
and 50% to the person who decides where the money should go. If you
give 50k to GiveWell, based on their research they gonna say 


**Definition**: 

**Checklist**: 
 

**Claims**: It is not fair to compare ETG to Not-GiveWell with working at GiveWell

## Are there spillover effects?

Possibly


## Impact at a job what all do you need?


## Estimate AI safety or research job

## Estimate GR at open Phil

## Peter's company

## GiveWell

## TLYCS
