## Entry question

What ~~is~~ could be the lifetime *estimated* impact (in `$`
donated) of being a ~~EA~~ GiveWell researcher?

**Epistemic Status**: Off by a factor 10 (#fermi-estimates)

## TL;DR

This is a fermi estimate and shall be treated like that. Everything is an
estimate, there are many uncertainties and geometric means have been
used to bring the limits down to one number.

**Lifetime Impact of a GiveWell Researcher**: `$`8m 

## Introduction

I am curious to know what sort of impact a ~~EA~~ GiveWell Researcher
has. I choose GiveWell, as there is a very "clear" dollar figure on how
much money they "influenced" (at least according to them). With this
essay, the lifetime impact of an entry level researcher starting in
2021, and working for another 35 years, is estimated. The following
components help put together the final figure:

**Organization Level**

1. Impact of GiveWell in 2021
2. Growth rate of GiveWell's impact for the next 35 years
3. Counterfactual impact of GiveWell

**Researcher Level**

1. Impact attributed to an entry level researcher in the first year
   (2021)
2. Growth rate of researcher's impact
3. Counterfactual impact of a Researcher

The rest of the essay deals with the above components and the final
lifetime impact calculation.

**Note1**: [Fermi estimates](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PsEppdvgRisz5xAHG/fermi-estimates) are in general factor 2 or even factor
10 off. In many cases this might just be enough.

**Note2:** This estimate does not consider several factors such as
probability of EA loosing its momentum, probability of getting fired
and not being able to contribute as a researcher etc.

## Impact and Growth Rate of GiveWell in 2021

GiveWell *estimates* how much [money they move](https://www.givewell.org/about/impact#MoneyMovedDefinition) every year and
publishes them on their website. For example, in the year 2019 GiveWell
estimated that they moved `$`[172m](https://www.givewell.org/about/impact). In order to estimate the
impact of GiveWell in 2021, a bit of extrapolation of data is
needed. For this extrapolation, the growth rate is used.

To predict the growth rate in the coming years I believe it would be
reasonable to base it on the money moved from 2015 to 2019 instead of
2007 to 2019. This is because it appears that in the recent years the
growth has sort of "plateaued"  and this might be more representative
of the future .

Thus, the [compound annual growth rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp) for the money moved between
2015 and 2019 comes out to be 9.4% (`(172/120)^(1/4)-1`). It's really
hard to predict the change in growth rate for the coming years. For
simplicity's sake, a constant growth rate of **9.4%** for the next 35
years, is assumed.

| Year | Money Moved (`$`) [^2] | Growth |
|------|-----------------------:|-------:|
| 2010 |                   1.5m |      - |
| 2011 |                     5m |   233% |
| 2012 |                    10m |   100% |
| 2013 |                    16m |    60% |
| 2014 |                    28m |    75% |
| 2015 |                   120m |   329% |
| 2016 |                   118m |    -2% |
| 2017 |                   149m |    26% |
| 2018 |                   161m |     8% |
| 2019 |                   172m |     7% |

**Impact of GiveWell in 2021**

As for the impact of GiveWell in 2021 it is estimated to be
**`$`205m** (`172*(1.094)^2`), based on a growth rate of 9.4% and the
money moved in 2019.

## Counterfactual Impact of GiveWell

The counterfactual impact of GiveWell is the difference in impact
between the "*Actual Scenario*" (world with GiveWell since 2007) and
the "*Counterfactual Scenario*" (world without GiveWell since 2007). 

In the counterfactual scenario, it is expected that a GiveWell-like
organization would have formed anyway, 3-10 years later (than when
GiveWell was founded)[^6]. It appears likely because, many "similar"
organizations (such as Charity Science Health, Rethink Priorities,
Open Philanthropy, The Life You Can Save etc.) have formed since then
(between 2010 and 2020), involving cost-effectiveness estimates and
philosophies such as "doing the most-good for a dollar".

While comparing the actual and counterfactual scenario, we compare the
two scenarios with the same amount of money but only varying
cost-effectiveness depending on the scenario. As a result it is
expected that when money doesn't go to GiveWell-like organizations, it
goes to some random organization which is *guessed* to be within 1 to
1/50th times as cost-effective.

<!-- **So to estimate the counterfactual impact of GiveWell the following -->
<!-- is needed:** -->

<!-- 1. Actual Scenario: Money expected to be moved every year by GiveWell, -->
<!--    from 2021 to 2056. This is obtained by extrapolating GiveWell's -->
<!--    impact as shown earlier (based on a growth rate of 9.4%). The money -->
<!--    moved is assumed to have a cost-effectiveness of 1. -->

<!-- 2. Counterfactual Scenario:  -->

<!--    - Money expected to be moved by a "GiveWell-like" organization from -->
<!--    2021 to 2056. The impact of GiveWell-like organization is simulated by shifting -->
<!--    GiveWell's impact by 5 years (geometric mean of 3 and 10 -->
<!--    years). This is also assumed to have a cost-effectiveness of 1 as -->
<!--    it is a GiveWell-like organization. -->
   
<!--    - Money expected to be used by "other" organizations with lower -->
<!--    cost-effectiveness--assumed to be 1/7 which is a geometric mean of -->
<!--    1 and 1/50--than GiveWell or GiveWell-like organizations. -->

<!-- 3. Subtracting impact of Actual Scenario from the Counterfactual -->
<!--    Scenario gives the final impact (having multiplied them by their -->
<!--    respective cost-effectivenesses). -->
   
<!-- 4. The difference is then represented as percentage of the Actual -->
<!--    impact from the Actual Scenario. -->

For example in 2021, as part of the actual scenario, GiveWell is
estimated to have moved `$`206m with cost-effectiveness of 1. As part
of the counterfactual scenario GiveWell-like organization is expected
to move `$`118m [^10]  with cost-effectiveness of 1, in that year. The
remainder `$`88m (`206m$ - 118m$`) is used by "other" organizations at
one-seventh (geometric mean of 1 and 1/50) the cost-effectiveness of
that of GiveWell. The difference between the actual and the
counterfactual situation comes to be `$`75m. And finally, the
counterfactual impact as a function of the money moved in the actual
scenario is 36%.

The below table summarizes the counterfactual impact for the different
years. For years **beyond 2021 the counterfactual impact essentially
starts to become a constant value of 31%**. This **31%** is used in
the final calculation as a constant.

**Note**: Cost of operation of GiveWell is not taken into account as
it is a small sum. For example, it is estimated that the cost of
operation of GiveWell for 45 people (`$`110k per person) shall be
`$`5m, contrast that to it's 206m expected to be moved in 2021 (a mere
3%). So this is skipped confidently.

**Note**: Also the effects of the [displacement chain](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nn4nPvxF59AAr2G2n/replaceability-with-differing-priorities#A_more_complete_picture) are not
considered for simplicity. 


## Impact Attributed to an Entry Level Researcher in the First Year

In the year 2015, GiveWell estimates that an entry level researcher
had 10% of the impact of a co-founder and that there were 9 co-founder
equivalents [^8]. In other words an entry level researcher was
estimated to be responsible for 1.1% (`10%/9`) of the total impact (in
2015). But this is not the whole story.

With more people joining GiveWell this percentage gets diluted. In
2015 there were 25 "equivalent staff members", where as in 2021 there
are 45 "equivalent staff members" [^4] and the resulting contribution
would thus be much less. Let's assume this contribution is inversely
proportional to the total number of staff. Then, **the impact
attributed to an entry level researcher in the first year (2021) is
0.6%** (`1.1%x25/45`).

## Growth Rate of a Researcher

The growth rate of a researcher is split into 2 factors. The first
being the growth rate associated with the 'increase in experience'
which leads to higher researcher's contribution as the years pass. And
the second being the growth rate associated with 'increase in number
of staff' of GiveWell, which decreases the researcher's contribution
as years pass.

For the "**growth rate associated with increase in experience**", the
year variable is held constant (and hence the number of staff is
constant) and the difference between entry level researcher and
co-founder is observed.

In 2015, a co-founder is estimated to be responsible for 11% of the
impact that year and an entry level researcher at 1.1% [^8].  If it
takes an entry level researcher 10-20 years (geometric mean: 14 years)
to reach co-founder level, then growth rate per year due to increase
in experience (alone) is a whopping 19% (`(11%/1.1%)^(1/n)-1`). (It is
assumed further that the growth rate falls sharply to 0% after
reaching co-founder level.)

{:.tablestyletwo}
| Item                                      | Value |
|-------------------------------------------|-------|
| Entry level researcher                    | 1.1%  |
| Co-founder equivalent                     | 11%   |
| Number of years                           | 14    |
| Growth rate due to increase in experience | 19%   |

For the "**growth rate attributed to increase in staff**", the
avg. increase in the number of people per year in GiveWell is
estimated. This increase is assumed to be negatively proportional to
growth rate attributed to increase in staff.

From 2015 to 2021 the number of staff has increased from 25 to 45
[^4]. This implies an increase per year of 10%
(`(45/25)^(1/6)-1`). This implies a growth rate attributed to increase
is staff of `-10%`.

## Counterfactual Impact of a Researcher

The researcher positions seem very competitive now (with ~1%
acceptance rate). If the entry level researcher manages to be 5-15%
(geometric mean: 9%) better than the next researcher in line (perhaps
my Deliberately Practicing), then that would be the factor multiplied
to the impact attributed to a researcher. This would then produce the
counterfactual impact of the researcher.

**Note**: I tried considering a "complex model" taking into account
[displacement chains](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nn4nPvxF59AAr2G2n/replaceability-with-differing-priorities#A_more_complete_picture) (explained in the appendix), but the
improvement was almost nothing (few `$`100k) compared to the final
value, so it has been moved to the appendix. Adding it here only made
the explanation unnecessarily complicated.

## Bringing it all together for 2021 to 2056

The different factors computed so far are listed below: 

**Organization level**

1. Impact of GiveWell in 2021 = `$`205m

2. Constant growth rate of GiveWell = 9.4%

3. Counterfactual impact = 31%

**Researcher Level**

1. Impact attributed to an entry level researcher in the first year
   (2021) = 0.6%
   
2. Growth Rate due to increase in experience = 19% between 2021 and
   2035, and 0 otherwise.

3. Growth Rate due to increase in staff members = -10%

4. Counterfactual contribution of Researcher = 9%

Taking them into account brings the counterfactual impact of a
researcher to `$`8m. The following table shows part of the Google
Sheets document (???) used to compute the final outcome.

**Note**: Milan Griffes estimates [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126162534/https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) that as an entry level
researcher he expects to make an impact of `$`90k (back in 2016). This
is one-third the estimate for 2021 as per the above calculations.


## Why I can only be a factor 10 confident

First of all these are all forecasts, there are a ton of assumptions,
such as a constant growth rate, counterfactual impact of a researcher
etc. I don't think a more complex model is the solution. Even a really
complex model of the growth rate will have it's own un-testable
assumptions by virtue of it being a forecast.

It is very hard to verify this on any level. For example, GiveWell
estimates that in 2015 that an entry level researcher contributes 10%
of a co-founder. I don't know how accurate this is and how they are
testing this assumption over time.

Many numbers are crazy sensitive. Just consider that the counterfactual
contribution of a researcher changes to 1% instead of the 9%, then the
final estimate falls from `$`8m to `$`800k.

The estimation gets even harder with things organizations like Rethink
Priorities for example, where they produce research and are not really
moving money.

## Appendix: Counterfactual Impact of a Researcher

The counterfactual impact of a researcher is the difference in impact
between the "*Actual Scenario*" where there is an extra researcher and
the "*Counterfactual Scenario*" which is without that extra
researcher.

A model table is shown below attempting to estimate the difference in
impact between the 2 scenarios. In the actual scenario we have
researchers `$R_{1}$` to `$R_{n}$` and people who Earn-To-Give
`$R_{n+1}$` followed by `$E_{2}$` to `$E_{n}$`. In the counterfactual
scenario we are missing `$R_{1}$` and the whole chain displaces
upwards accordingly. `EA` is the amount of impact being a researcher
and `ETGX` is the Earning-To-Give impact of different people. And the
final counterfactual impact is given by **`$R_{n}-R_{n+1}$`x EA +
`$R_{n+1}$`x ETG1**.

There are two components to the counterfactual impact of a
researcher. The difference between the extra (`$R_{1}$`) and the
displaced researcher (`$R_{n+1}$`) (`$R_{n}-R_{n+1} x EA$`). The
researcher positions seem very competitive now (with ~1% acceptance
rate). If the extra researcher (`$R_{1}$`) manages to be 5-15%
(geometric mean: 9%) better than the displaced researcher, then the
impact will be `0.09 x EA`.
   
In addition, the displaced researcher's Earning-To-Give (`$R_{n+1}$ x
ETG1`) will also contribute to the counterfactual impact. Assuming the
person is european and is willing to donate 10% of his salary, this
would roughly mean an Earning-To-Give base of `$`4000 plus a growth
rate of 5%.

	"Specifically, we roughly estimated the number of full-time,
    co-founder-equivalent people working on each area in each
    year. (Co-founder time was given a score of 1 but time spent by
    newer staff was scaled down significantly; for example, we
    multiplied time spent by entry-level staff in their first year at
    GiveWell by 0.1. These figures are far from precise, and are
    intended only to give a rough guess at our changes in total
    capacity over time.)"---[GiveWell

	Well in 2015 there were [21 people](https://web.archive.org/web/20150601044318/http://www.givewell.org/about/people) and 10 board members (not sure
	how much work they do). Let's round it to 25 people. ~~It was
	then estimated that this amounted to 9 co-founder equivalents with
	considering a 1st year analyst "valued" at 10% of a co-founder[^3]. So
	an entry level analyst is estimated to be responsible for `10%/9 = 1%`
	of the whole contribution, where the average is 4%.~~ 
	
	In 2021 GiveWell has 41 staff and 6 board members. We round it up
	to 45 people.---[GiveWell](https://web.archive.org/web/20210816090153/https://www.givewell.org/about/people)

	GiveWell's impact by 5 years (geometric mean of 3 and 10
	years).
