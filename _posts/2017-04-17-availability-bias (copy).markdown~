#### **Introduction**
Availability bias basically chooses whats important based on its availability. The true value system could be hiding behind the biases. If we remove this availability bias, would it mean that we can see our true value system?

This could be helpful in answering the following: "In such a hypothetical event that there are 20 million people dying out of hunger, it being required that UN generate 4.4 billion $'s and only 10% of that available, shoud I be working towards this cause in full flow or should I try to improve my social skills so that I get laid?

In other words what is our true value sytem!

#### **What do you expect**

In the essay on ["the way ahead"][the_way] I wrote about what I expect from writintg, I put it here for my convinience.

> I expect to know what I should be focusing on in life. I don't need to know the full solution, i.e., something that can guide me to eternity. I just need right now, something that can inform me what is more important to my true value system and why it is important. Something in the range of "Yo, people are the only thing that is important to you and you need to go to the extent of being called of being an extremeist because ..." or " Yo, people are not important at all, you should focus on buying ferraris, because ...". The reason cannot be just any reason, it should be backed by science. For example, "Yo, people are the only thing that is important to you because, when we look at "X" bias, we see that although the bias sucks, it appears to be intended so that you save as many people as you can, hence pointing to your real value system."

#### **Availability bias**
> Availability is defined as the ease with which a particular idea can be brought to mind. When people estimate how likely or how frequent an event is on the basis of its availability, they are using the availability heuristic. For example, people overestimate their likelihood of dying in a dramatic event such as a tornado or terrorism. Dramatic, violent deaths are usually more highly publicised and therefore have a higher availability.This heuristic is one of the reasons why people are more easily swayed by a single, vivid story than by a large body of statistical evidence.

> It is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples tat come to given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. If something can be recalled it must be important. For example, say you get two awesome ideas on a day while writing your essay. Suddenly, "This is why one should write". On all the days that life sucked, "Well, at least you tried".

> When people are asked whether there are more English words with K in the first position or with K in the third position, they use the same process. It is easy to think of words that begin with K, such as kangaroo, kitchen, or kept. It is harder to think of words with K as the third letter, such as lake, or acknowledge, although objectively these are three times more common. 

>  In another experiment, subjects heard the names of many celebrities, roughly equal numbers of whom were male and female. The subjects were then asked whether the list of names included more men or more women. When the men in the list were more famous, a great majority of subjects incorrectly thought there were more of them, and vice versa for women. 

> In one experiment that occurred before the 1976 U.S. Presidential election, some participants were asked to imagine Gerald Ford winning, while others did the same for a Jimmy Carter victory. Each group subsequently viewed their allocated candidate as significantly more likely to win. The researchers found a similar effect when students imagined a good or a bad season for a college football team. The effect of imagination on subjective likelihood has been replicated by several other researchers.

#### **Examples**

#### **Explanation**
Tversky and Kahneman argue that the number of examples recalled from memory is used to infer the frequency with which such instances occur.

Celebrities example.

Schwarz and his collegues, on the other hand, proposed ease of retrieval explanation, in which is the ease with which examples come to mind, not th enumber of examples, is used to infer frequency of a given class.

assertive example.


#### **Take**

Ultimately availability is defined as the ease with which a particular event can be brought to mind. The availability bias simply stated is that our Map gets its information from the availability. In other words, irrespective of reality, events, concepts, that can be recalled with ease have a higher availability and hence with the bias seem to be the "reality".

Higher frequency of an event implies higher importance. Higher frequency is determined by things like ease of recall. Our understanding of frequecny can be got by the same bias, celebrity example.


#### **Applications**
Media:


#### **Experiment**

I have this experiment in mind. The availability bias says that based on availability we associate a higher probablity to the event that is more available. An event that is easily recallable must be important. The event 'getting a girlfriend' is very important to me, and hence I assume it is 'available'. On the other hand, the event of 'saving a life or acting towards it', is less 'available'.

The availability bias helps us identify what is important, primarily based on the frequency of an event that takes place in front of your eyes.

With this experminet I would like to handle only this one bias.

My hypothesis is stated as, "If the importance of a task is determined by the frequency of an event in the recent past, then if the frequency of an event is made same for all events, then it should be possible to see what the true inclination of a human is towards, i.e., Value system"


#### **Exceptions**

Even if the frequncy and availability is made same, doesnt mean that we weigh all the different options the same. That is to say it is not clear what we need to compare. Does comparing 7 ferraris with 7 girls or 7 people dying even ddo it.

Nevertheless, in our situation atleast 20 million are dying and being realistic might also get us close.
#### **Issues**

The problem seems to be that I am still using my feelings, i.e, I am claiming that I am trying to make an experiment without such biases.
