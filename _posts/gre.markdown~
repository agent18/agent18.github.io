## Duration to study for GRE?

> As you can see, out of a random sample of a 1000+ 320+ scorers in
> GRE, we found that most of the students who score 320+ in GRE
> prepare for 45-90 days!  But, there are at least 200+ students who
> achieved a 320+ in GRE in just 30 days. --- [youtube greedge data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhZgalyrzCg)

Don't know what the median is but 45-90 days is what I should look at
(3s value prolly).

> how much time should you spend every day preparing for GRE?  Based
> on our 320 in GRE in 30 scorers, they have spent approximately 2.5
> hours/day to prepare for GRE.  With 1 hour & 15 mins on Quant & 1
> hour & 15 mins on Verbal!

3 hrs a day in 30 days. Doable



## GRE formate

2 verbal 2 quants and 1 writing + 1 experimental data collection 

Quants --> 

Verbal --> RC, vocabulary --> sentence completion, text equivalence, RC

writing --> 2 essays 

1 section --> 20 questions and 35 mins 

5 sections --> 175 mins

1 writing (2 essays) --> 60 mins 

GRE exam 200$ + 2 ets full tests + pdfs on overview of concepts

Can take GRE every 21 days 

Try 6-10 weeks and then gives you time to retry

## GRE At home

https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/register/at_home



## My plan

**Words**

800 words learning means 18 words a day in 45 days.

- kaplan 52

- kaplan flash cards 500

- Magoosh flash cards

- Barrons 800

See where this takes us.

**Verbal and quants questions per day**

There are 2500 questions in Kaplan. This would mean 52 questions a
day in 45 days. 

**Video lectures**

Video and read the kaplan book online. Finish them off first. Make
notes.

# GRE PREP from Kaplan
## Quantitative

### Mistakes

1. Missed decimals
2. x^2 = 25 means x=+-5;

### quantitative comparison

**You have definite relationship if there are numbers clearly given in
the A and B for**

e.g.,

A--> is **Subject**: from 19 to 31 and B is sum from 22 to 32.

So eliminate option D (no relationship). i.e., we only need to check
once.


**Strats**: 

1. choose number atleast twice
2. You can add subtract by any quantity, 
3. you can multiply and divide by positive values only.

i.e., g> 1 and A = g/g+3;

### Data interpretation

**In which of the years did wages increase by less than 1% of the wage
at the beginning of the year**

Apparently this means look at 2009 and 2010 (for the value of 2009).

**Look at graph to determine the year don't look at actual numbers first**

### Arithmetic

**What percent of 72 is 18 ?** It took me more time than usual.

**Is 12^34 divisible by 81, 144 and 28?** Not by 28. 

12^34 is 2^68 * 3^34 --> 81 is 3^4 clearly divisible, 144 is 12^2, so
clearly divisible, and 28 is 7*4, there is no 7 in this so this is the
wrong answer.

**Making mistakes while multiplying and subtracting (10s place)**

205*3.5 = ~707.5~ but it is 715.5 (Don't forget to multiply 10s place)

828.5-707.5 = 120 NOT but 121! 

### absolute values

Always think of them in terms of distance from the center


### Proportions ans ratios (star)

When asked "Ratio of boys and girls 5:13, there are 72 more girls than
boys, how many boys are there"

boys: 5x
girls: 13x
diff: 8x

8x = 72; x = 9. Now boys = 5x = 45. :)


---

"If y% of 140 is 112" => 112/140 = y%

### Rates (star)

Distance = Time x Rate

Time = Distance / Rate

Rate = Distance / time


**Distance is always at the top**

---

**2 people working on a project**

*You can add rates of people.*

Pandian takes 4 hrs to finish a job. Indian takes 6 hrs to finish a
job, how long for both to finish a job?

Pandian's rate is 1/4 project per hr. Indian's rate is 1/6 projects
per hr.

Together they can finish 10/24 projects in one hr. Which means
together they can finish 1 project in (look at the above formula), 

Time = 1 project / (10/24) projects per hr. :)

i.e., 2 2/5 hrs


**Formula for 2 people working on a project**

1/T = 1/T1 + 1/T2 i.e., T1xT2/(T1+T2) = T (time for one project)

**Multiply time by number of projects**

time for N projects = T*N

**Star mark question**

> In his Organic Chemistry class, Archibald has test scores of 82, 87,
> 88, and 95, with one test remaining. Which of the following scores
> on his final test would change his average by two percentage points?

his average by two percentage points --> +- 2 points. Direction is not
mentioned. But I assumed it like an idiot.


Make org-capture stuff question, tags, answer
## Verbal

Topic : general subject matter Stone of scone

Scope : Who owns the scone, how it changed hands

Purpose : to explain history by also taking sides with scots

WAS THE AUTHOR NEUTRAL OR NOT?

1. Casu Marzu is dangerous to even posess in italy.

---

1. Detail question

Select a sentence that identifies the preventive process

2. Inference questions

Selection a choice that says  one of the followingk

3. global question

4. Logic question

--- 

5. Reasoning question

When you have a conclusion and an evidence,

1. To strengthen the argument you need something that brings
   conclusion and evidence close.
   
2. To weaken the argument you need something that gets them far away.


e.g.,

X and Y are two mayan cities whose ruins are found. Conculsion: They
both died in the same earthquake.

For this the Assumption needed to strengthen the conclusion would
somehow relate X & Y together.


### Reasoning

Contentment is directly related to an ability to mentally separate the
judgments of others from one’s own view of the results of one’s
actions. Thus, if you wish to be content, you should practice
releasing yourself from a sense of guilt for any failures.

Which of the following is an assumption made by the argument above? 
	Guilt is an unproductive emotion that should always be suppressed.   
	Those who are close to judgmental people cannot find any
	contentment.   
	Feelings of contentment are always preferable to feelings of
	guilt.  
	Contentment can easily be mentally separated from guilt.   
	Releasing guilt makes it easier to separate one’s own view from
	the judgments of others.   
	
	
**Conclusion**: (To be content)[1], (you should practice releasing yourself
from a sense of guilt for any failures)[2]

**Evidence**: (Contentment)[1] is related to (ability to mentally separate
the judgments of others from one's view.)[3]

The primary factor determining whether an area in the western United
States will have water shortages in the summer is the amount of
snowpack in the region’s mountains from the preceding winter that
lasts into the spring. Precipitation this past winter in Nevada was
far above normal, so that state is unlikely to experience water
shortages this coming summer.

Which of the following, if true, provides the most support for the conclusion above?
	Water use rates throughout the western United States have
	increased consistently over the past 10 years.  
	The ability of meteorologists to predict precipitation levels
	months in advance has improved greatly.  
	**Most of the precipitation in Nevada's mountains this winter fell
	as snow.**  
	Above normal snowpack in Nevada results in increased tourism from
	skiers and other winter sports enthusiasts.   
	In Nevada, factors other than the amount of snowpack have a small
    but measurable effect on the likelihood of a summer water
    shortage.  
	
**Conclusion**: Nevada unlikely to experience water shortage

**Evidence**: Precipitation this past winter in Nevada was far above normal.

**Additional evidence**: Amount of snowpack determines the water
shortages.

**Missing ling**: Precipitation is in fact snowpack

The insect known as the Asian citrus psyllid is a vector of citrus
greening disease. If it lays its eggs in the new leaves of an infected
citrus tree, then when the larvae become adults and fly off to feed on
other citrus trees, they can spread the disease to healthy
trees. Fortunately, scientists have definitively determined that a
small number of trees in the Los Angeles area constitute the only
infected trees in California. Thus, removing and burning those trees
will stop the disease from spreading into other areas of California.

Which of the following would most weaken the conclusion stated above? 
	Most diseases affecting agricultural crops in California are
	transmitted by insects.  
	Most citrus growers in California are not concerned about citrus
	greening disease.  
	A number of areas bordering California have substantial acreage of
	citrus orchards infected with citrus greening disease.  
	The bacterium that causes citrus greening disease is only spread
	by insects.   
	Florida has been successful in slowing the spread of citrus
	greening disease by using insecticides to eradicate the Asian
	citrus psyllid.   


**Conclusion**: Removing and burning those trees will stop the disease
from spreading into other areas of California

**Evidence**:  Spread through insects in bad trees. Bad trees in california.

**Additional Evidence**:

**Answer evidence**: Bad trees outside as well.
