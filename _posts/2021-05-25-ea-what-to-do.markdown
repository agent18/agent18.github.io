## Feedback from an STM

Machi,

Great job on calculating the lifetime values for the different
scenarios. Nice to see that you've consistently put in 4 hours per
day.

> In a few years I can “build the skills” through DP hopefully and see where that gets me.

This is the weakest link in the chain. You're not clear about what "build the skills" means.

If you're serious about this, you need to follow what the successful
people here have done. Don't spend your time doing "DP hopefully and
see where that gets me". Offer your services as an unpaid intern or
assistant to the people who are already in the loop. That way, they
will get some benefit from you and in turn you will find out what kind
of skills you actually need to learn. Ask people directly what steps
you need to take to be "GiveWell researcher material". Application
rejections don't give as much detailed feedback.

Another weakness in the analysis is that the first two paths involve
concrete dollar figures whereas the latter two paths involve estimated
impacts.

Overall, the statement from my previous email stands. Recommend
focusing on getting a data science job before "DP, blog, skills,
etc.". Still, I could of course be wrong about this. I leave it up to
you. Good luck.

Best,


## Entry question

What are the successful people doing? How did they make it? What am I
missing? How do I become GIVEWELL material.

I got the feedback that my assignment was "not upto par" 

## How does someone become GiveWell material? or OpenPhil

In [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301000000*/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting) post on OpenPhil's site regarding their 2018 research
analyst role they say the following:

**What can someone do now to become a stronger fit for future Open
Philanthropy generalist RA openings**

Below are some personal ideas, which might or might not be worth the
required time investment if you might be interested in a generalist
RA-like role at Open Philanthropy in the future, and which are not
necessarily endorsed by everyone on the RA hiring committee. In no
particular order:

*   Practice writing explanations of your thinking on complicated
    topics, and aim for strong clarity, succinctness, and [reasoning
    transparency](/reasoning-transparency). Post these explanations to the web if you can,
    so that you can get feedback from readers.
*   Familiarize yourself with basic concepts in [cost-benefit
    analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis) and [effective altruism](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/).
*   Learn how to critically evaluate published evidence. E.g. see
    these GiveWell blog posts: [Our principles for assessing
    evidence](https://blog.givewell.org/2012/08/17/our-principles-for-assessing-evidence/), [How we evaluate a study](https://blog.givewell.org/2012/08/23/how-we-evaluate-a-study/), and [Surveying the
    research on a topic](https://blog.givewell.org/2012/09/06/surveying-the-research-on-a-topic/).
*   Be familiar with the basics of descriptive and inferential
    statistics, Bayesian reasoning, and microeconomics (supply and
    demand, comparative advantage, elasticity, marginal thinking,
    value of information, etc.).
*   Practice making [Fermi estimates](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PsEppdvgRisz5xAHG/fermi-estimates).
*   Do [calibration training](/blog/efforts-improve-accuracy-our-judgments-and-forecasts#Calibration_training), both with trivia questions (e.g. see
    [our app](/blog/new-web-app-calibration-training)) and ideally also with real-world questions such as
    those featured on public prediction tournaments like
    [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/) or [Good Judgment Open](https://www.gjopen.com/).
	
## **Give Well Job apps**

[Senior researcher](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://www.givewell.org/about/jobs/senior-researcher)

### The role

Senior Researchers at GiveWell are the intellectual leaders who guide
our exploration of how we can do the most good. In this role, you will
be responsible for finding, researching, and ultimately recommending
high-impact or potentially high-impact giving opportunities. As part
of a small team, you will be a significant contributor to our
decisions about how hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent with
the goal of saving and improving the lives of people living in the
lowest-income communities in the world.

You will be a leader on our research team, conducting research to help
us identify outstanding programs to recommend. Examples of questions
Senior Researchers have worked on recently include:

*   [What is the impact of building footbridges in rural
    communities?](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/bridges-to-prosperity)
*   What should we believe about the impacts of improved water quality
    on all-cause mortality?
*   [How can we model the general equilibrium effects of cash
    transfers?](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://blog.givewell.org/2018/05/04/new-research-on-cash-transfers/)

In addition to the core work of identifying outstanding programs,
Senior Researchers own messy and complicated questions that inform our
analysis, such as:

*   [How can we improve our approach to cost-effectiveness
    modeling?](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models)
*   How should we use pooled impact estimates from a highly
    heterogeneous evidence base?
*   [How should we prioritize programs that reduce poverty relative to
    programs that reduce deaths? What is the moral value of each
    outcome?](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://blog.givewell.org/2019/12/02/new-research-on-moral-weights/)
*   [How should we think about the opportunity cost of other actors’
    contributions to programs we fund?](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331205215/https://blog.givewell.org/2018/02/13/revisiting-leverage/)

Our Senior Researchers leverage a combination of critical research
review and synthesis, empirical analysis, modeling, logical reasoning,
and good judgment in order to make practical recommendations on a
topic.

### **About you**

Senior Researchers typically have a quantitatively oriented advanced
degree and/or substantive relevant experience. They also have the
intellectual flexibility to tackle a wide range of questions such as
those listed above.

We expect you will be characterized by many of the below qualities. We
encourage you to apply if you would use the majority of these
characteristics to describe yourself:

*   You are passionate about helping improve global health and
    alleviate global poverty as much as possible.
*   You are highly skilled at critically analyzing and synthesizing
    empirical research and understanding how a body of evidence may
    apply to real-world problems.
*   You are able to plan an efficient approach to exploring
    complicated questions, including identifying and focusing on the
    most decision-relevant aspects of a project.
*   You consider the big picture, asking questions like: is this
    project appropriately formulated and the best use of my time? What
    is GiveWell getting wrong in our research?
*   You clearly communicate what you believe and why, as well as what
    you are uncertain about.
*   You ask a lot of questions, and are curious, rather than
    defensive, when interrogating your own or others’ work.
*   You are able to execute research that holds up under scrutiny from
    others and over time.
*   You are respectful, effective, and efficient in your interactions
    with colleagues as well as external parties.

Confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. Here’s
a secret: there's no such thing as a "perfect" candidate. GiveWell is
looking for exceptional people who want to make a positive impact
through their work and help create an organization where everyone can
thrive. So whatever background you bring with you, please apply if
this role would make you excited to come to work every day.


## Charity Entrepreneurship 

https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/blog/how-to-increase-your-odds-for-Charity
Entrepreneurship

## Open phil researcher

? Next

## **What all do you think you can do?**

1. join ea meetups and ask "people" what? what steps do I need to
   take?
      
   I took steps that a anjan suggested i.e., tableau, Machine Learning
   (kaggle) etc... But that didn't get me the job still... as there
   were "better fits" or the job market was full and HRs were looking
   for experience and it was covid? 
   
   Did he nail the skills or not? but he is using them right? he said
   ya, spark and all that... But I don't belive I will get a call just
   because I use spark.

2. rigorously apply for internships and assistant positions

3. Search in EA forum

4. AMA on EA forum

5. how to have better answered the internships you failed.

6. do a course to get uptospeed with statistics of poverty, how to
   estimate it? etc...
   
7. Connect with people on LinkedIn and do what?

8. Attend GiveWell donor briefing

9. help run a local ea group?

10. Find stuff in the EA group?

11. How about DP? in the way that you look at their research see how
    they do it and copy it and understand it and then play chess?
	
12. Speak to or ask people like Peter and David (from RP)

13. volunteering (fb options)

14. read papers on covid and follow spencer greenberg on twitter and
    that of AAC guy on fb... he is making surveys etc... I want to
    work on it...

What is the fucking skill again?



## What to ask people

1. How did others "make it"?

2. What steps should I take to become "GIVEWELL material"

3. What have the successful people done to get a japs?

4. 


**Who**

Peter Hurford

Max daniel?

others from GIVEWELL and Openphil

**Which companies**

- Charity science health
- RP
- OPP

## Program assistant role Open Phil

Why are you interested in the Program Assistant role
Apply to more assistant roles...

[Program assistant role](https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/get-involved/jobs/program-assistant)

### Why are you interested in the PA role?

I hope to gain out of this role one of the above:

1. growth into OpenPhil like 

2. Shadow the great Luke and 

3. Know what sort of skills are used here to become quality researcher

4. work with greats, facilitate them and in the process learn

Several people like [Nicole Ross](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-ross-184a6142/) started as a staff assistant.



### content

writing clearly examples?
- understanding claims made by others
- dp on working with claims
- links to articles I am proud of (like moving, dp)


write statistics separate

usgae og gokul sheets with 
- making lifetime calcs
- diving into givwell and Charity Entrepreneurship cost estimates

after sending the cv
- focus on statistics course dive (Data Analyst on that thingy?)
- and effective altruism principles
- https://www.openphilanthropy.org/reasoning-transparency#Example_of_GiveWell_charity_reviews

### final response in the task for additional comments

1. I have added formulas and notes wherever possible as it is much more efficient to do it this way for larger spreadsheets. This way I would have to only do the "fact checking" and the rest is automated. I have indicated some additional changes I did using the color ORANGE. 

2. Also, Is there any reason to use 50% "cut-off" to classify probabilities? In Data Science we often use ROC to decide "optimal cut-off" based on what TPR and FPR we need. 

3. This might be nitpicking, but what to do when the "odds" are equal to exactly 50% for "Prediction right" column? I have just marked it using this formula `=IF(C2>50%,"Yes","No")`. I would guess that the researcher doesn't make such predictions as they might not add value.

4. Regarding the additional time: I made some mistakes reading the instructions the first time, but when I was checking before sending it out I saw the mistakes and rectified them, hence the additional time. Sorry about that.

## Mistakes other people made

https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QFa92ZKtGp7sckRTR/my-mistakes-on-the-path-to-impact

## Statistics and other courses?

- hypothesis testing
- ability to read papers by esther dufalo on thier nobel prize and
  other papers on mental health (for Charity Entrepreneurship)
  
- CI of SD, CI of sample on sample, 

- regression, logistic and linear

- different types of distribution and how to identify them?

- Model selections? when to use annoava? when to useF-dist, the last
  part of khan academy (the one that ripped fast through)
  
- Using Bayes thoeram, naive bayes

- sampling methods

https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/

Get the books and maybe start here.


do an excercise on linear and logistic regression... or do data
analysis by esther?


### Books to read
## How do you get "better" estimates?


## afraid of something

taking a job in open phil like orgs... What about your backup pandian?
what about insurance? What about savings?


What does failure to move into Ea look like


## to read and hear

If you're looking for something high-impact you can do part-time, I think often the strongest option is to help run a local EA group.
I've added a mini write-up of this path on our careers list:
https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/#run-a-local-group
Many people are also not aware that there are now tens of paid
full-time positions running these groups, so it's rapidly turning into
a full career path. More info in the write up.

what she expects you to do? particularly scheduling, with the
possibility of escalating responsibilities in the future.

### What I sent her (my application)

Hi Elizabeth,

I am from the Netherlands. I saw your post on facebook about needing a
personal assistant. I would really like to apply for it. I hope we can
schedule a call to learn more about what you do and how you do it, and
about how I can be useful to you.

About my time availability as a personal assistant: I have a full time
job from Tuesday to Friday (only 32 hours). I am available at short
notice and am willing to take more responsibilities as you see
fit. Except 3am to 11am ET from Tuesdays to Fridays, I am pretty
flexible about when you need me to work.

P.S.  The Netherlands is 6 hours ahead of ET (3 am ET is 9am in the
Netherlands).

About my work experience: Data Analyst and ex-mechanical-designer with
experience in web-scraping, SQL, machine learning, software
development, stakeholder management etc.  Effective Altruist with
demonstrated ability to quickly learn way-of-work, concepts and tools,
to deliver results (Recommendations, p.3 resume).  Have 2+ years of
total research experience on wide variety of topics, as a Guest
Researcher in TU Munich, an Intern at NXP Semiconductors, and a
Project Associate at IIT Madras.  I have attached my CV. Please let me
know how to proceed. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards, 
Thej Ravichandran

- what can I learn from her?

- what is it that she needs?
- what is it that I am?

- How will things escalate?

- Is the time difference going to be a problem for her?

- Her 9 to 5 am ET is, 


- What I am after?

### notes about meeting

New hamshitre state legislature 4 years, served in elected office, 

1. change that EA aligned... Longtermism, ex-risk reduction,
   pandemics... 

2. detail-oriented, juggle different tasks, not offended low-value,

scheduling calendly has made it ...

doctotrs appt and other things hair cut... colleagues with their
schedules (2 colleagues)...

Where will this take me?

longterm? help us make releavant decisions, Lot of judegment calls
about people s trustworthy ness? skills? are trainable and
not... helping people figure out about EA carrer work in politics,
another set of eyes on somebody's qualification... Maintaining human
connections, following up with candidates... valuedrift... 

10 weeks in this role... 

explaining policy to normal people was very draining unpleasant, felt
pretty frustrated with how it .... long term financial grants..

are you only grants? did you 

whether they should run? what timeline should run? 


## Rethink Priorities face to face 90 min interview

### about me

1. I am all about examples
2. very skeptical about peoples advice who have no experience in it


### questions from RP preparation

QUESTIONS:

1. Why are you interested in joining Rethink Priorities?

	- Peter hurford fanboy (gotten a lot of advice from him, respect
      his growth)
	- I think it is great to have people you share your values with
	- backed by OPP
	- org that is hot now compared to GIVEWELL
	- breadth of research is amazing GH&P, X-risk, animal welfare etc...
	- prediction oriented (X-risk) as well as evidence based (GH&P)
	- very forward thinking (10% to maternity leave to being fully
      online) and leadership is very young...
	
2. Tell me about a time you were doing research on a topic you weren’t
   initially familiar with. How did you go about figuring out which
   sources to trust? What did you do in your search process for new
   information? How did you figure out what evidence existed in the
   field and where the gaps in the literature were?
   
   - Talent constrained specific claims
   
	   - EA is TC --> Did they hire less than
         they budgeted for? we don't accept statements of ("we found
         good candidates bla bla")
	   - (Started with hiring round posts, reached out to org's CEO,
         scrolled through their website, compared old websites to new
         websites on wayback machine)
		 
	   - Orgs are FC --> Look at their fundraisers, where it is at?
		   --> Look at if their projected budget and see if they meet
		   it with one year togo.
		   --> Look at if they increase their budget from year to
		   year?
		   
	   - Is it hard to get a job in EA --> What is the 
	   
   - Career plan US probability
   	   - Probability of making it through the H1B process
		 - how many years can you apply for the stem process max (3
           times) quora, friends who have done it.
	     - What is the probability of getting in the lottery in one
           attempt (Looked at articles and followed up their citation
           to make sure the article is not random!)
		 - Used probability to calculate for three years
		 
	   - Identifying which probabilities exist (RFE) (general
         probabilities exist (on forbes, )for that but there are many
         rejections), look at trackit for cases on rejectsion on
         blind, check out other friends who have come through despite
         a shit background, if my personal probability would be
         higher.
		 
		 There are companies
		 
		 
		 Check if I can find some evidence
	   
   - counterfactual thingy
   
	   show the example...
	   
   - Research in tu munich --> hyper-reduction --> books, papers and
     getting feedback from people. Use multiple key words
   
   
3. Tell me about a time when you did a deep review of someone’s
   work. What was your process, what did you prioritize, and how did
   you communicate your thoughts back to the original author?
   
   - Talent constrained --> 80k
   - tu munich research
   - GIVEWELL cost-effectiveness estimates
   
4. Tell me about a time when you had to work on a tight deadline. What
   happened?
   
   - Work stuff with Jerry on EPIN design
   - 7 days to write a summary of the book
   
5. Tell me about a time when you reached out to an expert. What did
   you do to reach out? How did it go?
   
   - reaching out to Charity entrepreneurship, GIVEWELL, Happier
Lives Institute, 

	- For career reaching out to several people in the field to help
      me understand what I should do differently.
   
1. What would you do if you had to speak to and get impartial
   information from a partial advocate of a particular topic? The
   advocate you need information from is focused on making as strong
   of a case for their cause as possible, whereas you need
   dispassionate information gathering.
   
   - focus on examples, actions, no advice or opinions, only data as
     weak as it maybe. (example, ?)
   
2. [Not given to you in advance, as we are interested in how you react
   to the question without preparation.]
3. [Not given in advance]
4. [Not given in advance]
5. [Not given in advance]

How do you see this? how would you approach this?
indonesia --> 2022 chance of earthquake > 1bill in damage.... 

1. [Not given in advance]

How do you see this? how would you approach this?
econmic development is a good thing, factory farming...
example.. eicher countrues 

1. What would you like to get out of this job? Where do you want to
    progress to? 
	
	(grow to manage more researchers but first I need to
    be very good at it, take on more and more responsibility, be more
    independent).
	
2. Do you have any prior management experience? If so, can you
    describe your role and responsibilities?
	
	- just helping new associates
	- leading committes to organize events... 2012, chariman tudelft
      2015, asml PPC leading it.
	  
3. What do you not like about managers you’ve had in the past? If
    possible, be specific about a time you had an issue or conflict
    with a past manager. What was the issue and what was the
    resolution?
	
	- not allowing to work on challenging assignments
	- their close mindedness, 
	- the vagueness of the whole process of 
	- feedback and everything depending on his mood on that day
	- no concrete metrics and folding their hands like hell...
	- manager conflict?
	
4. I’m aware this is in the weeds, but please walk me through the
    organizational system you use. When you begin work in the morning,
    how do you decide what to start working on? And as items come up
    during the day, where would you capture those so you didn’t
    forget?
	
	- look at the differnt high level things I need to do, 
	- make a small todo and prioritize (ease of completion and
      importance)
	- everytime I start work in the evening, I look at the todo I made
      last time and update it.
	
5. Have you done any joint research projects in the past, where you
    collaborated with at least one other person? If so, how did you
    manage the collaboration?
	
	- In UNI and at work everything is joint
	- "manage the collaboration"
		- each person had his own things to do
		- split up who is responsible for what
		- have regular discussions
	
6. When would you be able to start if we were to hire you?

	- in two months or less, depends... 1 month might also be possible.


### questions to RP

- how do you decide which topic to go for?

- how do you measure your progress?

	sTRICT DEADLINES, REPORT, WEEKly checkins, 
	
	did you feel micro managed?
	
	how much time do you work? (part time 20hrs a week --> strickt
    about...)
	
	internal slack channel, whether you achieved progress

- what skills are required to become "RP/gw" material? I want to
  deliberate practice

### RP feedback request

I was wondering if you can please help me by selecting these
checkboxes ( [ ] --> [x] ). There will be no followup questions unless you allow it.

*I didn't go to the next round because:*
[ ] - My 2hr assignment was "not good"  
[ ] - My submitted research assignment was "not good/relevant"  
[ ] - I did "poorly" in the interview  

[ ] - I did not have research experience in the EA field  
[ ] - Others had >2 years research experience in the EA field  
[ ] - My "critical feedback" back to 80khours was not right  
[ ] - I have not worked with others while researching  
[ ] - others have better qualification (Harvard degree, EA prior
experience)  

[ ] - My answer to the open questions like "Calculate chance of
earthquake in indonesia" was "not good"  
[ ] - I have poor knowledge in understanding Internal and External Validity
[ ] - I don't have experience with Fermi Estimates
[ ] - I have "poor" writing skills
[ ] -  other  
I think I should follow up on with the person who got the job and ask
him what he did and how he got it...

Hi Peter,

Last week I was informed that I didn't make it to the next work task
round for Staff Researcher. I had a great experience with the whole
process nevertheless.

I was wondering if you are able to point out "specific skills" that I
need to improve on to become "top RP Material". I would really
appreciate any insight into this question.

Thank you very much. Looking forward to your response.

P.S.
Are there any internship opportunities with RP at this moment?

Regards,
Thej

### FP indrew questions

Team was impressed with your Cv and how you answered questions.

Looking for 2x AR and 1x Sr. Researcher. They are looking for 2x
generalists.

Completely remote. with open hours for 15 mins flat hirarchy.

Sjir is in Netherlands and Johannes is in Germany.

People like to block time and work and have separate times for
meetings.

**Familiarize yourself with work from FP.**

**read climate and lifestyle**, I said I will do a review of reports.

Currently 25 people in process for 2 jobs over 100 applications. After aptitute test by end
of next week.

Aptitude test is coming up and that it's 40 mins.

1. Tell about your recent experience? what are you doing?
   
   write, give, DP, ME, Data Analyst, critical review

2. How do you manage startup environment dynamic, changes

3. How did you get into EA

4. Do you have any preference on where you would like to work

I said all is equally lucrative, focus is really high-impact.

1. Do I think Bayesianly? Do I have baysian thinkign

2. What they are lookign for

Someone who can add a fresh perspective, curious, great thinker.

They are looking for generalists, with the "right attitude",
absolutely motivated, generalist, has the skills but that is not the
only thing.

### FP aptitude test

find some sources and grind for 3.5 hours? on the different
aspects. Look at picnic as an example. It was one of the toughest.

### FP rejection and feedback questionnaire

I was wondering if you can please help me by selecting one or more of these
checkboxes ( [ ] --> [x] ). There will be no followup questions.

*I didn't go to the next round because:*

[ ] - I did "poorly" in the interview with you
[ ] - I did "bad" in the aptitude test
[ ] - I did not know about FP's research
[ ] - I did not know about Bayesian thinking
[ ] - Others had >2 years research experience in the EA field  
[ ] - Others have better qualification (Harvard degree, EA prior
experience)  
[ ] - I don't have experience with Fermi Estimates
[ ] -  other  

### FP feedback from Sjir

Animal advocacy movement

Sentience? consciously experiencing positive or negative consious
states. That makes for me moral obligation...

during a debate, actually people seemed to agree, quite likely that
all of these animals could have positve and negative states. Lot of
similarities. Disagreement about language (pain, )

sentience you need to be consious... what it takes to be concsious

sentience and consious difference???????????

If there is 1 in a 100 odds. Pretty good chance that we need to act
nigga!

Even if there is a 1 in 100 chance, we should not drink and drive..

given the scale we are at.

We should consider possibility


Remember how you felt today.

**Jason Schukraft**

https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/invertebrate-sentience-table

numbers, tractability, whether they can experience or not

Right now working on a system to compare across biological, how should
we value , difference in moral status

**robert**

Done quite some , seafood chef --> 

rodents, I saw crabs --> responded purely by reflex --> so no
assumption of pain --> conducted experiements to test it --> could not
be reflexive, give up valuable responses, avoid electric shocks,
avoiding potential predators, long term changes, risk avers after
electric shocks. 

anythink convincing that they dont experience pain... Strong
possibility..

**Heather browning**

relationship between animal sentience and welfare, ethical
implications.

pain is one dimension, but what about hunger?

crustacians are more likely to have sentience as they can do something
about it, unlike oyesters

## discussion with Alicia Weng on being a GIVEWELL Researcher

**General**

1. My agenda is talk to you about how to become an GiveWell researcher
2. What is the difference between an analyst, associate, consultant
   and researcher 
   
   How much exp people have... 
   
   Identifying promising opportunities, Cost-Effectiveness, evidence
   reviews, talking to charities, investigating specif opportunities
   for grants.
   
   Analyst, desk review, not open ended...
   
3. What is it that you do? what do researchers do? What do analysts
   do? What is the most recent thing you are working on?
   
   - few projects
   
   - Malria prvention pills among children, figuring out distribution
     to diferent sub populations... (effect size translation to target
     population)
		 - Thats the intervention gauging, talking to a bunch of
           charities, not implemented before, checking or guessing who
           is in a strong positioning to run the intervention.
	   - Vague, 2 things that ,,.... open endedness, don't have good
	   answers. Cost-Effectiveness medical oxygen to patients, this
	   program would be ... modeling parameters... 
	   
	   piecing to gether poor evidence... 
	   
	   Prioritizing...
	   
**Becoming GiveWell Material**

1. What steps should I take to become a "GiveWell Material"? How to
   get feedback?
   - writing independent research
   - writing reviews
   - working on looking at academic papers, in the context of
     methodologies, data collection, internal external validity,
     discounting
   - courses? economics, statistics? 
   
   Understanding academic research evidence of programs (strengths and
   limitations) biases, effect size given that... example
   
	   practice on the website (AMF,)
	   
   New interventions (table of looked) reports.
   
   Cost-Effectiveness analysis (quantitative) -- splitting benefits
   and cost side for top charities (interventions research page
   kinkaroo mother care report givewell website)
   
   Communicating very transparent probably promising uncertain.
   
   other skills
   
   Work trials projects --> check in effectively, clearly state
   uncertainty, proposing
   
2. What are specific skills to work on? How to get good feedback?
3. Hiring from abroad examples?

	difficult sometimes and but they always don't want it to be a
    barrier,
	
4. What other orgs? and exit opportunities exist for you?
   
   35 and 40... how much I like learning opportunities, more
   difficut. others are invested in my growth. 
   
   More ownership of my projects, management, and managing people...
   
   GH&P there are "lots" of opportunities
      
   JPAL, TIFID, IDinsight,
   
   there are people who left to do software. Why?
   
5. Longtermism?? quite a bit a bit of overlap... thinking about 

	burden , tractabiltity (forecasting...) framework, open phil
   
6. Courses? OCW, MIT Data decisions please do it. 

	Harvard , quantitative master's economics phd
   

## Discussion with Stephan


1. My agenda is talk to you about how to become an EA researcher
2. What is it that you do? what do Sr. researchers do vs Analysts?

I work remotely (all 4 years). 2017 ,various projects. Biosciences
guy... ? More exp, training, Advanced projects such as closer to a
grant decision, analyst early stage

2 projects are investigating interventions that improve water quality,
technologies Cost-Effectiveness not have safe water, clorine
dispensers for safe water (well), inline clorination (urban areas
tanks)

science with uncertainty

another project --> community management on malnutrituion (look for
malnourished children), get them treatment. address sensitive stuff

am pretty basic on advacnecd statistics, conceptual level, 

Economics bg typical ...

analytical mindset, critical thinking skills, communicate, writing.

3. Do you still have time to do your weight loss, book, neuroscience
   related activities?
4. Is there a hiring plan for the coming year? no idea
5. Hiring from abroad examples? 3 timezones of them 
6. how did you acquire the skills to get into GIVEWELL?
7. I have no harvard degree, no PhD (should I not bother with
   GIVEWELL?)
8. Is Data Analysis and Data science of any use in GIVEWELL?
9. What steps should I take to become a "GiveWell Material" so to
   speak
   - courses
   - deliberate practice of certain skills
	 - reading academic papers
	 - Cost-Effectiveness analysis
	 - writing independent research
	 - statistics
	 
	 Application process really values critical thinking and
     communication skills in writing
	 
	 Several stages
	 
	 writing conversation notes (listen to a recording and summarize
     that and key points)
	 
	 - conversation notes (find a recording or factual conversation)
	 - Promising looking intervention, quick evaluation of it,
       literature searches, google searches for organization, room for
       funding (how many people have this disease and how much would
       it cost per person), 
	   
	   evidence assessment 
	   
	   - major focus on efficiency, getting close to the answer.
	   - literature pubmed google scholar, econ papers (meta analysis
         first)
	 - cost effectiveness analysis (botex) first stage
	 - meta regression, multiple regression, statistical tests,
       understand those things. statistics and probability
	   - any course you would suggest
	   
	   - cochrane meta analyse would be helpful
	   
	   - he's happy to help if he can.
	 
10. What about exit opportunities? What orgs are there?
11. Would you prefer 100k $ a year or a researcher 5-15% better
    (whatever that means) than what you find in a typical interview.
	
	directing over 200m , I would go for the researcher... everything
    we have efficient allocation of that money, more than that 
	
12. I have to make the choice of pursuing Data science seriously or
   looking at orgs like givewell
## writing

Unable to have continuations, My endings suck

Which tense to write in? often flabbergasted by this


While writing reason what should come first?


Struggling and not sure if my verbiage is wordy, struggling to write
my impact analysis i.e, trying not to be wordy and not sure how to
explain for example the what to put in footnote and what not, while
writing that section on counterfactual impact, how do I explain that
shit in an understandable manner.

should I use bullets or not, but it looks ugly?


Take this for example... I am really struggling to write well

and it is painfull to fix this shit... I really suck at writing.

## Make a simpler comparison and show that these are fermi estiamtes
and that we shouldn't care about this shit anymore and go on to
something that is more tractable
