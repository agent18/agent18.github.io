## So far

We know talent is overrated

Above 30 also you can learn skill (but migh be harder to really go
further)


## Story time

So what should you do in life? Emm I dont' know. Ok how can you figure
it out? What all do you need for it?

Different options and something to compare them with... and of course
if I do it now.



## EA is not bottlenecked consequences

### replaceability

### spillover effects

## Value of working in EAO result

## Will I get a job in EAO

## What should I do in an EAO?

- Will I get a job in an EAO?
- What is value of a job in EAO?
- What is the value of ETGing?
  - How much can I actually ETG?

Why do you think so? Any examples? For example : after one year of

Do you have an example of an "median EA" getting into early stage
projects? or are you farting?


Claims claims claims... examples please.. what is median
competent... very unverifiable and in words and english like 80khours.

What are you refering to? These are just claims....

Why? what are you talking about? ok it will oscillate I guess

Thank You for the post. The ideas are interesting.

I was finding it hard to read the post though. Maybe I am totally
wrong, but some of the reasons I think are that the sentences are
quite large (81 words). Aaron runs a free service as an editor, maybe
that can help before posting.

So, if you're thinking of applying for a position for which you expect
the other applicants to have very different priorities from you, other
than the one for the given cause (and your priorities differ
significantly from the average in EA), it might actually be better to
let them have it instead, because then you can better ensure you
contribute counterfactually to your own priorities, rather than
contributing counterfactually to their priorities, or the priorities
of someone else down the chain.
