Median 28, IQR = 38.5-21.5 = 17
** Other info
IQR is nothing but the 25th percentile - 75th. 

25th percentile can be got by looking at 0 to 50th percentile's
median. ;)

Pandian takes 4 hrs to finish a job. Indian takes 6 hrs to finish a
job, how long for both to finish a job?

** The Answer
2 2/5

** Other info

Pandian's rate is 1/4 project per hr. Indian's rate is 1/6 projects
per hr.

Together they can finish 10/24 projects in one hr. Which means
together they can finish 1 project in (look at the above formula), 

Time = 1 project / (10/24) projects per hr. :)

i.e., 2 2/5 hrs
