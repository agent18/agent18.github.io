Pandian takes 4 hrs to finish a job. Indian takes 6 hrs to finish a
job, how long for both to finish a job?

** The Answer
2 2/5
9
** Other info

Pandian's rate is 1/4 project per hr. Indian's rate is 1/6 projects
per hr.

Together they can finish 10/24 projects in one hr. Which means
together they can finish 1 project in (look at the above formula), 

Time = 1 project / (10/24) projects per hr. :)

i.e., 2 2/5 hrs
