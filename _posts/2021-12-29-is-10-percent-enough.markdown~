## Why am I talking about this?

As always every two years when I meet an STM, there is some paradigm
shift. This time was no different.

We were casually talking about how much an STM was going to give. And
I think I was afraid he was gonna say "10%" and I was gonna be like
WTF, you are an STM, you are supposed to give more, if I in
netherlands can do that, you can do much more. And then the paradigm
shifting discourse began.

Such clear thoughts only possible by an STM.


## Why 10%


## 4 tings

1. Earnings
2. % of earnings
3. feeling of garbage (are you a robot)


other things to address: For so long I have derived a great deal of loftyness
