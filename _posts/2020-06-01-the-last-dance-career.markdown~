## Entry question

What should I do next? Should I go for a Masters? Should I upskill for
EAO?

## EA jobs have high impact in Research

I am going to try making a life time impact calculation (very rough)
based on [Milan Griffes attempt here](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/). [People seem hesitant to
make such calculations](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/afDCCvCsZcz8axoPp/examples-for-impact-of-working-at-eaorg-instead-of-etg) for some reason. And somehow they are able
to make decisions without these. All I want to do is just see if it is
even worth spending time to be a researcher in the [already crowded
space](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting) (OPPs recent hiring round).

GiveWell moved 110m`$` in 2015. An entry level researchers
contribution is expected at [10% of a co-founder](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/05/givewells-progress-in-2015/). Over a life time
I find it hard to believe that one will be stuck at 10% of the
co-founder contribution. With time one would move up the ladder and on
average *I assume* one is at `30%` the co-founder
contribution. GiveWell employed [9 co-founders](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/05/givewells-progress-in-2015/) that year. So we
get a multiplying factor `0.3/9`.

Just like we divide the impact of the org to the different people, it
seems that we should also divide the impact of the 110m among the
following: the Donors (e.g., Good Ventures), the middle men
(GiveWell) and the intervention orgs (AMF). The impact from the
110m`$` seems to belong to each of these Orgs. *I assume* all orgs
have equal weight in this for lack of any other better estimate. So we
get a multiplying factor `0.33`.

**Replaceability of org**

Now we get into counterfactual estimates of the org itself. What is
the utility to the world if GiveWell existed, minus when they didn't
exist. I don't know how to estimate this but it appears [80000hours
uses a factor `<=0.3`](https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/fnBnEiwged7y5vQFf/triple-counting-impact-in-ea/comment/CWxdafynvn3nQ7v9b) to estimate their counterfactual impact. We
shall roll with this for now for lack of any better estimate. So *we
assume* `0.3` again.

So far the Impact for a researcher at GiveWell is
`0.3/9x0.33x0.3x110m=363k`. This final value is TOO sensitive to any
changes in the factors listed above. For example, if the 'Contribution
of the Org', changed from 0.3 to 0.4, then the outcome increases by
about 100k to 484k.

**Replaceability of person**

Counterfactual estimates for the impact created by a person in an EA
job, is the difference between, when he takes the job and when he
doesn't. This is quite hard to predict. It not only depends on the
next candidate who didn't get this job, but what that next canidate
did next and if he ended up displacing other people in EA, and
following the chain of events.

Depending on the situation this can vary from 0 to 363k`$`. Imagine a
job opening where anyone who meets a "very high bar" can get that
research position as there are enough funds for this. Such a person
seems to take credit for all of the 363k. However, imagine a case
where there are 2 similarly skilled people for one job that was
open. `A` gets the job and `B` can do ETG but can donate only a few
100`$` a year. This makes the counterfactual impact of `A` 100`$`.
  
In reality there are many people and it is hard to trace the actual
impact. Attempting to make estimates seems to need a lot more
assumptions which I am unable to back up with examples.

**Conclusion**

It appears that EA work has a lot of potential impact ranging from 0k
to even >363k. My problem is there is a lot of uncertainty. And this
number could be extremely high (even in millions) depending on the
type of work one chooses and how much better he is than others .

It shows how hard getting an EA job is. It takes [a few years to build
up from no job to yes job](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but). For Peter, apparently it took him 5
years of hardwork to get to founding his own org. MSJ, to get an
internship in CE, took 2-4 years and quite some hardwork (writing your
own research, showing up at EA conferences, criticizing research
etc...). For Saulius, it took about 2 years and 2 internships.

I recently apped for an internship and didn't get it. I probably need
to work on it for a few years and copy actions of these examples. In
addition I really suck at understanding claims, so add a few more
years?

**Conclusion**: It could take about 2-5 years and "a lot of hard work"
before I get into an EA org.

## DS vs L1 ETG

I am limiting my sight to DS only for it involves "critical thinking",
working with statistics, working with claims, hypothesis testing etc.,
unlike Computer science. Statistics is apparently useful for research
as can be seen by what GiveWell and OPP seem to want via their job
descriptions. Earning potential wise, it appears there is not "much
difference" ([looking at the average salaries](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/which-is-more-promising-data-science-or-software-engineering-7e425e9ec4f4)). ~~Maybe I should
look at FAANG in particular to check if there is a difference.~~

Earning potential is quite high in the US. Earnings are substantially
larger than here in Netherlands. I know DS people with 4yoe in Apple
California earning 300k TC and others with similar in Walmart with
300k TC. While here (Netherlands) people seem to be [earning
78-103k](https://www.glassdoor.nl/Salarissen/Booking-com-Data-Scientist-Amsterdam-Salarissen-EJI_IE256653.0,11_KO12,26_IL.27,36_IM1112.htm?experienceLevel=ONE_TO_THREE) as per Glassdoor. With such salaries as in the US there
are people like ([Jeff Kaufman](https://www.jefftk.com/donations)) who are able to donate 50%. This
amounts to about 150k.

There are 2 ways many people I know take, to get to US. People take
the masters route, and then work towards an H1B visa which allows you
to work there. The other route is the L1 route. In this case you work
in say Amazon in India (for e.g.,) and then try to move to the US on
an L1.

**Probabilities**

A lot of random factors are associated with working in US. Getting an
H1B is based on lottery. Whether you are doing an L1 or Masters in the
US you end up having to deal with H1B at some point. Either after
Master's or before your L1 expires (<5years). There seems to be a 60%
chance that a person like me will clear this hurdle [^2]. This is
completely random and out of my control. This is including atleast 3
tries at H1B (i.e., 1-3 years of applying).

For the Masters route on top of this, I need to be able to be good
enough that in 2-3 years I end up at FAANG or atleast the large corps
like Walmart etc. I have seen examples of people in FAANG whom I know
well, and thus think it is definitely within reach comparing myself to
them. Worst case it should be possible to atleast get a DS job in
California from where I can grow into FAANG. People are able to do
bootcamps and join DS from different industries such as [Electrical
Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashankmaiya/). This suggests to me that it is definitely not out of
reach.

For the L1 route, the biggest hurdle would be to find a company that
is L1-able. There are examples I have come across, across fields and
countries. There are people who went all the way to JP Morgan in New
York on an L1 after a few years in India???, [SWe engineers from India
who are now in FAANG](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramshandilya/). ~~People demanding a job in US because they
are good and pushing for a job there.~~ Atleast for mechanical
background, people from ASML Netherlands regularly work in the US for
a few years on L1. It seems accessible. I have to look into the
possibilities more.

In addition, the US is not the most friendly place for workers
rights. Once you loose a job you have [60 days to find another
job](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/just-got-laid-off-h-1b-job-i-any-grace-period-can-i-another-visa-jobhunt.html). In times of recession (like in 2008 or during the Coronna
period), the chance of loosing job seems to be about 15%[^5] and might
mean a one way ticket back to home.  This comes to a multiplying
factor of `84.6%`.

**Costs**

With the Master's route based on examples I have seen, 4 to 6 years to
a FAANG 300k job (2-4 yoe +2 for masters). With the L1 route 2-3 years
yoe + 2-5 years before getting H1B transfer. 4-8 years from now.

I think I have to do an online masters atleast to be able to fight
when the time comes to defend an RFE[^4] and also to improve chances
with H1B[^9], in case I choose the L1
route. Estimated at [20k](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7o21qw/berkeley_master_data_science_mids_vs_other_online/) for 2 years. But I will be working during
that time and can cover my costs. With the regular masters route, I
would have to spend 50-70k at a public university and mostly can't
work during that time. Becoming a total of 

**Conclusion**

The fact that the probability reduces to below 50% is scary for both
cases. In the Master's case this seems to imply that I could be in
debt of 50-70k in case things don't work out (worst-case). Yes there
are opportunities to get tuition waiver such as working as a teaching
assistant, but that seems to be something that everyone is going to
try for. This means that I have to pay my debt for another 5-7 years
before I can potentially ETG again. For the L1 case, atleast I am not
in going to be in debt. 

In the Master's case I am afraid I will not have time to work on
building skills needed for research work. First I start with GRE, get
a job here in DS, working out the universities, applying, sending
documents, talking to people about where to go etc. Combined with my
actual 9-5 job I think there is not going to be much time. During
Master's I tend to spend all my time to get better grades and working
all the time on work, and applying to jobs. I would want to do
everything in my power to learn skills needed and get good grades.

In the Case with L1, if I end up working in Netherlands and doing a
masters part-time, maybe the story is the same. Once I get to the US
on L1 I will be working on getting an H1B type job. That would be the
focus. So both cases I am unable to build EA related skills.

Going to EAO might be "harder" than now as I would have passed
several crucial years where I could have spent learning skills related
to an EAO[^7].

Considering the debt part alone and the reduced anxiety due to that, I
would prefer the L1 route. It is still unclear what the chances are
with meeting an L1-able company. L1 on the other hand also allows you
to gain a few years (2-4y) experience before applying to FAANG. So, in
theory if someone pays for my masters and I had "experience" (of 2-3
years), then **both options are almost the same.**

The number of times a person can apply for H1B on a Master's is around
[3 times on a STEM OPT](https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-can-I-apply-for-a-H1B-visa-after-getting-STEM-Masters) (answer by Carlos Cueva). With an L1, we
assume we are ready from the 3rd year on to apply for an H1B (having
secured another job by then). So we will have the same 3 chances to
apply for H1b. 

**Note:** Some companies do not hire you in your OPT if you don't have
[atleast 2 attempts](https://www.teamblind.com/post/FAANG-that-accepts-candidate-with-less-than-24-month-OPT-46DqLqvB). Also there is a possibility of applying with
many H1B sponsors for the same year with different employers. So lets
assume I have 3 tries for now.


Based on a 50% split between the general pool and the advanced pool
([which is what the DHS have assumed](https://www.happyschools.com/h1b-visa-2020-probability-lottery/)), we see that with 3 H1B
attempts the chance of success is 80% for people with students with
Masters.

allowing 230k people every year and starting in 2009 with [650k

According to *Acquisition of word-processing skills by younger,
middle-age, and older adults.*

> The study included three age groups composed of 15 female subjects
> each: younger (A/ age - 2 1 . 5 years. SD - 3.5. range 18-28): middle
> age (M age -- 42.2 years. SD - 3.1, range = 37-481; and older (A/ age
> =- 60.7 years SD = 3.6, range = 55-67).

After roughly 21 hrs of training and excercises on word processing
with SuperSCRIPT, subjects took one final exam which was
timed. Earlier exams were also timed, but let's look at the last one.
Younger batch got a mean of 87 and the middle batch got a mean of 106,
i.e., 20% slower than the younger batch. The older batch were 68%
slower compared to the younger batch. This is an example of how slow
the mean learning of a person in the age of 37-48 could be.  It's not
bad at all. There is a wide amount of uncertainty expressed in S.D=28
mins. It is expected that when I am at 37 it could be much lower than 20%.

This is "consistent" (alteast in the order of magnitude) with IQ:
