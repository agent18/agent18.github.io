## Basics

Use [ubuntu-certified-hardware](https://certification.ubuntu.com/certification/)

Always, google said laptop with keywords: Laptop name, ubuntu,
linux. Check for issues in that laptop

Know your laptop

## Current laptop specs

AMD A6 processor
750 GB harddisk
3.3 gig ram
with 2gb ish graphics card

WIFI radeon

Basically wifi gave up after a year or 2 of usage, no going back, apparently, laptop screen
started flickering and is not portable anymore. I didn't know but
there is a massive video card problem, which is responsible for the
fucked up boottime. 

On a fresh boot my system hangs and is super super slow, even while
running just some basic chrome and emacs. Make a lot of sound,
informing high processor usage when I a run videos for example. 

Bottom line, I have spent time and tried to fix this. A lot of
time. Not worth it anymore.

Budget 200 bucks

## Buying ubuntu pre-installed?

Might be pricy 


## Using a chromebook

it is basically linux os. Hardware should be fine, but usually comes
with limited specs as it is meant for being light and carrying around!

## Why not a Desktop

I would like a laptop, one that I can move around.

## Buying second-hand

Places to buy

informatique
mediamarkt
bol.com
coolblue
azerty

## TODO

  * [ ] Check System76 for what types of laptops they sell, maybe you
        can buy them
		
  * [ ] Find cheapest laptop and put up your research on it, such as
        specs, cost, where to buy and run over the basics part.
