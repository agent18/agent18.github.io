## Actionable insights from rajesh


1. [x] remove recommendations (sounds like a fresher)
2. [x] Remove grades (sounds like a fresher)

3. ~~Remove Visa Status (debatable)~~

4. [x] summarize as skills and tools (no fluff?)

5. [x] Don't educate people on what they should read into (""lots of
   linear algebra"). Think in terms of end cases, i.e., you are tasked
   with reducing failures of machines
   
6. [x] 20k too small remove? (try to convey ho/w it would be useful in this
   company). "highlight significance beyond work. I don't have enough
   opportunity, looking for suitable opportunities"

7. [x] Gate ranking?

8. ~~remove 30 years~~

9. [ ] Lead team played music (play it differently)

10. [x] Keep experience upfront and connect the shit to-gether, show that
    in your spare time you have worked on projects, learnt
    stuff.. Don't be alpolegetic. Say that you were triggerd to do
    data science
	
11. [x] You are not a student.


12. [x] "feelings to incorporate"

	- hardworking, honesty, creatve, maturaity, experience creativity
	- Think in terms of use cases... saving money improving
      productivity,
    - I am taksed with reducing failures of machine... understanding and
	  predicticng when parts will brek.... under what conditions,,, analyse
	  it and tools use to do that...	  thing 
	  
13. [x] How did you reduce 300 hours, what did you do? how will you make
    it repeatable?
	
14. [ ] Put a picture in the Resume?
