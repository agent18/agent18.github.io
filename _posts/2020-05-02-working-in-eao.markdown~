**Entry question**: Is it worth it to get an "EA job"? What about
replaceability? What are your chances of getting it?

## Is it worth it if you get an EA job? 

What sorts of impact can you have?

**Longtermism**

[42 people in OpenPhil](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team) move over 100million in 2018. On average
they are moving about 2.38m<span>$</span>. Expected to be "much less",
considering. This 2.38m could have "much larger" effects aka save
"many many lives". They would have used some cost-effectiveness
estimate I assume and hence all the different grants potential should
be equal per dollar spent in saving lives for example. That is set.

OPP is "just advising" where money should go to. There are donors of
the "fund", then there are OPP's researchers who say where the money
should go, and then there are the people who work on the grants. 

What is the imapact someone has? So a grant could end up saving say 1k
lives. This 1k has to be split among all the people who worked to make
it happen I think. But it can be imagined that I could be in the far
end of the chain and make or break 1k lives. This informs me that I
could take the credit for all 1k lives.

Impact shall be defined as net lives saved when OPP existed - net
lives saved when OPP vanished. Poof!

If my existence made or broke the saving of 1k lives, then I am
responsible for the lives of 1k lives. What about the people before?
Again, if they were there or not there what would happen? If donros
were there and not there, if OPP was there and not there, if the grant
players were there and not there? If any part of the chain fell then
we would not be able to save those 1k lives. So all three could seem
to be essential. It would be naive to assume that opp can thus take
all the impact because its existence makes or breaks the chain. Cause,
the same could be said about the grant users and then donors. 

Now for some more reality. The grant makers have 100m and decide to do
something good. OPP comes in does some research and dedicates it to
say AMF. Leading to save 1k lives. Then impact is shared by 


There are somethings missing such as contribution of the donor,
contribution of the people ahead in line otherwise we would be double
counting.

Then there is the counterfactual impact which in total could decrease
the actual impact from 2.38m<span>$</span>. A first year researcher in
GiveWell is expected to have 10% of co-founder impact and GiveWell
seemed to have 9 co-founder equivalents in 2015.

## Replaceability

## Chances of getting it

- Fear of not getting anything at all due to lack of jobs, 2k people
  for 15-20 positions is straight up insanity and wrong. 

- 
## Different positions I am considering

Management, running an EA, statistics related, generalist researcher,
data scientist


## Focusing on personal fit?



## Conclusion  
  
So pandian is doing crucial considerations research. So far I have
seen that working in DS can impact say 150k$ with 30% certainty of
pursuing such a path or going with 15k (maaaax) with for the rest
(i.e., working in NL). This results in 57.5k donations including
percentages.

This sounds really low.

**So I need to estimate something similar for EA side for one job? or
atleast look at previous estimations or guess-estimations from
people. Taking into account different forms of replaceability.**

Am inclined to choose a path now in NL with some form of
statistics. This way I could theoretically still pursue DS in L1 with
that limited chance. But if I gave my everything to pursue a career in
EA (so vague) researcher for ex then does it make sense? Or should I
already look to do something else like management... who are the
managers I know? What is their impact? How did they become managers?
Should i get a policy cedric? should I do that DEDP course which costs
me 1k$?

what about lack of opportunities? come back to statistics. What
happens 

so I need to perform this dual function of being good in statistics
and being good in "research", writing, critical thinking etc...

wow man this might not be that complicated. For now then pursue this
shit of ds degree, L1 route, atleast start with statistics, :( ML and
then simultaneously see if you can get a job in EA or what you need to
improve to get in EA in an Impact job and not a replaceable one. 

again you need to be great! not really serve a lot of people!!!!!!!

I think I am missing the whole point. I thought i needed to do
everything  in my power to save as many people as I can... Can I do
that in EA, What do I need to power myself with?

**Claims**: to be tested. I feel like I shoudl move to DS (keep my
options open)  and then pursue Ea type works pivotting. Even if I get
fucked then I can "always jump back".

can't believe I am landing with somehting that homie Peter said.


See what allows you to neglect the shit of certain paths. If it even
makes sense to pursue certain paths.
