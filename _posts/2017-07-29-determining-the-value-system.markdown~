#### Everything is a feeling?



At this point I start clubbing the definitions of feelings and intuition together.

You see that your feelings are untrustable as they are giving you circular preferences in many places, in some places they are outright wrong (sugar urge), in many places they are incapable of computing a decision, and it becomes circular.

We have a sugar urge. More we eat in todays world, the more harm it does to the health. Despite knowing this, we are unable to control the craving. So you can assume 2 things, that somehow long and healthy life is not worth anything close to the sugar rush. or that the brain can't compute sufficiently. but if you go by feelings, then you have issuess.

We also see that feelings is the only thing we have. We know that feelings are untrustworthy, but then what else do we have?  Everything seems to be a feeling. Apparently even Modus ponens follows from feelings/intuition. Modes Ponens is when we agree on 'if P then q',  then if P happens,  Q happens as well. The very basics follows from feelings!  Everything seems to be ultimately a feeling or rather, something that makes me feel like something is right or wrong, tells me whether I should be doing something or not.

Often times I have thought of questioning my current thought process, but I refrained from it. I can't start at questioning my very thought process right now. Then I am lost max! Where will I even begin if you question the very tool that I use to think now. It's one thing that I have been avoiding all along; The only tool I would continue to use and question later. Maybe this is it. You have to use this faulty system, to know more about what the system is meant to do, to repair the faulty system or to make error corrections. This is how far you can get with this faulty system. You accept that you have a faulty system and that that is all you have. Every thought is processed through this system. Anything you think is through this faulty system. Everything you do is thorugh this faulty system.

We know that the system is faulty. We know many cases where the system is faulty. We only have this faulty system where in we dont know what is right and what is wrong. 


#### What are my other options
What are my other options anyway? I could probably let someone very wise to let me know what I should do. But whether I end up doing it or not would still be in consultation with my current system ([solution inside my head][tj_solution]); based on whether I feel like doing it. For example, if the wise man told you to chop someones head off, you would not do it right, even if it is [Peter Singer][], even if he says that it is based on science or whatever! And how do you determine he is wise in the first place? [solution inside my head][tj_solution]?

There is a solution inside your head. It doesn't matter what others say, or what anyone says on how to lead your life, unless it makes sense to the solution inside your head, its worthless. If someone says he has the solution to life. He gives you a box and you open it up and it says, "Chop of the head of the nearest child". For the sake of this argument lets assume no one will ever know and that there will be no consequences. I am afraid I can still never do it, irrespective of who it comes from. If someone says that you have to eat grass, then I guess I still wouldnt do it. But if someone says that you have to help people to the extent that you go broke, I still wouldn't do it. Atleast with all the counselling I have gotten over the years from an STM, I just can't take any solution said by anyone which feels like it makes sense. When I have to dedicate my time and effort to keep with the solution inside my head, the minimum requirement I guess is that it should make sense. It should be reasoned well enough, that I feel it is the right answer. 

To summarize it seems that anything not in **MY** solution in my head is repugant (chop someones head off, kill someone, killa a child), anything that is in the solution in my head (have sex, hang out with friends, travel) seems like I could go for it. I don't think I can accept a solution from anyone, even if it is part of the solution in my head, I think the solution needs to be reasoned with well enough, before I take the official plunge.

A few decades ago, we thought slavery was alright, women should not have rights to vote, women belong in the kitchen, transgenders are bad and harmful and useless creatures who don't like to work, being gay is a disease, etc... But somehow we seem to have a different take on this now. What happened to the solution in our head?

>The Solution has evolved! Or, rather, our understanding of the Solution in our Head has evolved.

>It is like a rough map of some terrain. Initially, it just marks out some hills and a river (“Don’t kill me, I won’t kill you. Let’s hunt together”). Nothing is to scale. There are vast parts unmarked (“how to treat women, blacks, gays, etc.”). Then, as we gain more and more knowledge, we fill in the vaguer parts of the map (“Ah! Black people are basically just like me. It is wrong to treat them like slaves”).

>Make no mistake, we have just explored a tiny bit of the territory. There are still huge sections of the map still hazy and blank.    
-[STM][]

Going back to the slavery part. It appears that your solution in your head can evolve based on reason. How? for example, I imagine a  scenario where we realize that even black people are just like white people, skin color is such a fragile concept that we cannot base so much importance on, so much so to decide that the black people are worthless. They are also just like us.

The solution can evolve, say based on reason. It appears, as we see in the slavery example, or for that matter with gays, or the LGBT community. You can be brought up in a christian household or any othodox shitass household, and you might think being gay is a disease. Being transgender is a disease. But REASON. They seem to be just people like us. For no fault of theirs how can we hate on someone, for being themselves? It could very well be you! You were just lucky enough to not be them. How dare we look at some stupid book(having no evidence to support itself in the first place) and judge people based on that! How dare we claim superiority over someone just because they are from a particular race? whilst all along, there seems to be a tendancy to think that we would like to save fellow human beings. It seems like the current solution in our head can evolve, or our understanding of the true solution in our head can evolve. 

But we do know of people who are terrorists, who are sufficiently large in number to cause so much havoc in the name of something they think is right, somthing that is part of their solution in their head! How is it that they can chop someones head off with ease, but not me. Why is it part of their solution in their head. Am I missing something?

I want to say that they are being brainwashed. They believe that what they are doing is part of something higher and bigger. They don't bow down to reason. They think blind faith is justified. For them the effects of social proof is seemingly more important thatn reason. They have told themselves and using confirmation bias fooled themselves so much that they cannot change? The very first flag for me is that they beleive in an almost random book, 0 evidence. They give you shit that is absolutely unacceptable by the standards of science. Just because their surroundings seem to think it is THE book, it's not fair to trust social proof to such extents. They are quite closed as no points of view can convince them even with facts being blatantly wrong in the book (such as the earth is flat bitch!). 

My point seems to be that they don't bow to reason. They hold on to something, merely because they have been holding on to it for a while, social proof, maybe thats the way they have been brought up. They do not see the discrepency when they use science when you need to build an aircraft, a 100 storey building, but somehow think it is sane to trust something without any evidence what so ever, despite them being against known facts. We use science becuase it works. It predicts things. It has a far more bettwer success rate than your friendly neighbourhood FAITH. So yes. Reason where art thou? 

Do you use science everywhere in you life bro? Pot calling the kettle black?

Why does their solution not have the capabilities that you claim to have? I don't know the solution to everything. I feel like I am stuck. I am only coming with things I think might actually be the reason. I guess they are led ashtray, or the way we say it makes them so closed, or that their FAITH is hardcore.

My vishwaroopam transformation started as a result of an STM, in the beginning when we got out together, with his help mainly, out of god forsakken religion. But MAddy our  very good friend, severed our friendship because we were talking something other than he beleived. He often told us, "I am far away from the land, there is no turning back for me". I guess Maddy beleived in something, he saw that it gave him say happiness, and then it was good enough for him to stick to it. He didn't question his reality. I guess we know now that there are many ways to get what maddy had, [to devote yourself to something higher than yourself][martin_ted].

But as a conclusion, I don't understand this part as to why people are different than me. Why didn't their solution inside their head help them see the truth.

HAAHAH! I think I have been seeing things wrong. The solution inside your head has a list of things it agrees with. But that doesn't necessarily have to translate to actions. When someone tells you that you should have a lot of sex in your life, you seem to agree with it. It feels right. And you are able to go ahead and do it if you want. When someone tells you that you should chop the head of the baby next to you, you immediately see a strong repuganance as it is not part of the current solution inside your head. Having looked at the terrorist example, we should be vary that the solution inside our head can change to practically anything?

I started off with what my options are and then I talked about the solution insdide my head why?

People cannot tell give you a solution in a box and hope that you actually will take it word for word. The solution should first make sense to your solution inside your head. And that might just be enough for some people, but I would like to go further to the point of reasoning it our clearly. Perhaps a peer-review to make sure I am on the right track with my reasoning. Peer-reviewed resoning.

It is clear to me now that this is all I have with me. A bunch of feelings representing a faulty system. A solution inside my head, telling me what might be right and what might be wrong. Perhaps something mightier than feelings. A solution inside your head that is, well, not complete or not fully uncovered or wrong in someplaces.

#### Feelings as only direction pointers

Eleizer in his post on [The "Intuitions" Behind "Utilitarianism"][ele_intuition] says,

>I see the project of morality as a project of renormalizing intuition. We have intuitions about things that seem desirable or undesirable, intuitions about actions that are right or wrong, intuitions about how to resolve conflicting intuitions, intuitions about how to systematize specific intuitions into general principles.

>Delete all the intuitions, and you aren't left with an ideal philosopher of perfect emptiness, you're left with a rock.

>Keep all your specific intuitions and refuse to build upon the reflective ones, and you aren't left with an ideal philosopher of perfect spontaneity and genuineness, you're left with a grunting caveperson running in circles, due to cyclical preferences and similar inconsistencies.

>"Intuition", as a term of art, is not a curse word when it comes to morality - there is nothing else to argue from.  Even modus ponens is an "intuition" in this sense - it's just that modus ponens still seems like a good idea after being formalized, reflected on, extrapolated out to see if it has sensible consequences, etcetera.

#### But what do you do anyway?
You have a faulty system.

Eleizer further elaborates and I seem to agree with him on this part that, if you stick to purely intuition/feeling, your view will be fucked because of all the things we saw earlier such as, misrepresentation of wants, circular logic, heuristics not capable of handling the complexities of current society, etc.,

But if you don't use feelings, then you are just as empty and worthless as a rock.

But then maybe there is a ~middle ground~, a third option perhaps, wherein you reflect on intuitions, extrapolate to see if it makes "sensible consequences" etc...

If you remove the feelings, there is no you. You just become a rock. If you fully use only your intuitions you are no different from a caveman. You'll be stuck with circular preferences.

But how do you know for sure what feelings are right? How do you know your intuition is right?
You don't

>But what do you do anyway?   
-Eleizer in the [same post][ele_intuition], 

>The obvious choice isn’t always the best choice, but sometimes, by golly, it is. I don’t stop looking as soon I find an obvious answer, but if I go on looking, and the obvious-seeming answer still seems obvious, I don’t feel guilty about keeping it. Oh, sure, everyone thinks two plus two is four, everyone says two plus two is four, and in the mere mundane drudgery of everyday life everyone behaves as if two plus two is four, but what does two plus two really, ultimately equal? As near as I can figure, four.    
-Eliezer on [Why truth][ele_truth]

Paraphrasing Eleizer, As far as I can figure out 2+2 gives 4. The idea being if you have 2 un-reacting stones, side by side along with 2 more of them, in total you should have 4, and not 3 for example. That is what 2+2 means. Its a facilitator that helps us in daily life to know in advance what we will have in the end. Its a rule of the universe!

How do you know modus ponens is right?

>"Intuition", as a term of art, is not a curse word when it comes to morality - there is nothing else to argue from.  Even modus ponens is an "intuition" in this sense - it's just that modus ponens still seems like a good idea after being formalized, reflected on, extrapolated out to see if it has sensible consequences, etcetera.

> The snow is white if and only if the snow is white

What I gather from all of this is that, this is it. You only have for yourself the faulty system. But what do you do anyway? You use it. But you don't just use it, you reason, you use science, you use bayes, and come up with the best answer you possibly can. You should make your beliefs pay in anticipatory experiences.


#### The hypothesis

I am going to say my hypothesis out loud. For that is all I have.

We have seen a number of feelings earlier, which can be blatantly proved wrong. For example, we saw about the sugar urge, where 
we saw that our brain gives us this urge to make us eat more viatamin-based foods while there was no way to overeat them. But now we see that this backfires in all sorts of diseases, if we continue to do this with currently processed foods. Another example as we discussed earlier was about the israeli scientists who found that a single child appeared far more valuable, got much more contributions than a whole group of 8. But there are some base feelings, such as the feeling you feel when a child dies next to you. The feelings you feel when you are hungry. Could they also be wrong. Any extrapolation from there on is the tricky part. The one that goes wrong as it involves actual calulations, something it appears that our brain cannot do  well.

And all along we have seen that calculations seem to be the fishy part. 

For example,

Q:If there is a child dying next to you, right now, will you save it?   
A: Yes (High emotional quotient)

Q:There are children dying everywhere, right now, why haven't you saved any?
A: I haven't saved any because I don't feel it.

Q:If the child is 10m away from you, right now, will you save it?
A: Yes

Q: If the child is 20 m away from you, right now, will you save it?
A: Yes

Q: If the child is 1km away from you, right now, will you save it?
A: Maybe

Why is it so important that the child dies next to you? Could it be that the brain wants you to help people who are only less than 20 m away or that it can't see, and hence it can't feel it, and doesn't emotionally satisfy you to take action? Knowing the brain for what it is, it seems highly likely that maybe we wan't to save children irrespective of location. It seems unfair to the dying kids to tell them that you don't feel it and would not help them because of that. If they died next to you they probably had a chance. Obviously, or probably, the brain works by providing you emotional feedback to make you act. But certain things are beyond its capability. It was not designed to sustain life and make your value system happier in the current world we live in.

If you hoped that people next to them are helping them, think twice, and look once at the stats. If you say that they are from a differnt country then I have some small questions for you that will hopefully get you to go your circular caveman like preferences. I remember writing this sometime back, 

>There are so many millions of people waiting at the shores of their cities, with their hands extended towards the sky, in a desparate cry for help. They raise their hands and look upwards, with the hope that something will save them from their plight of starvation, malnutrition, and just simple basic needs. They don't know they are actually asking you. Little did we know, that they are actually looking to us for help. 

And yet here I am cursing those people, because they didn't raise my emotional quotient sufficiently.

I quoted this example of my friend, who all of a sudden donated 75 euros to a girl who was his teachers daughter back in kenya. He said "Kanla thanni pathavudan..", meaning I was moved to tears. i.e., emotional quotient. There is no way for the family to know that he donated. Except me no one else would know. And trust me. 75 euros is quite a big amount for him here. About 7% of his salary.

Q: I see a video of aleppo suffering. Allepo is fucking thousands of miles away from me. Why do I tear up.
A: The brain can't understand large distances

It seems to me like a silly reason to just give up on people because they are far away. The point is that they are not far away, the point is taht you cant see or hear them and are hence unimportatn. If someone is insde a room locked and being raped but you can hear of see them, but you know about them. PNN. So many circular preferences. No clear cut reasoning available.




These base feelings such as 

Ask the same to telmo and what happens?

So we need to determine which of our beliefs is true from this value system.?

How do you know what feelings are right? 

We take every intuition we have, reflect upon it, extrapolate to see if it has sensible consequences.


#### Base feelings

The larger goal seems to be that we want to have consistant wants, non-fragile wants, non-silly wants, wants that last despite some shit feelings based on shitass calculations.

The fault with the brain roughly speaking seems to be calculations, extrapolations, large numbers, inconsistant feelings, differnt feelings for the same event based on different sensory experiences. Some other examples, would be is that you brain is trying to map reality using sensory organs. Based on whether it sees something or hears something, the situation within us completely is different. Imagine hearing that 6 million people are dying. Not phased one bit. Show me one peta or allepo video, tears.

As Thalaivar says, 

>"Intuition", as a term of art, is not a curse word when it comes to morality - **there is nothing else to argue from**.  Even modus ponens is an "intuition" in this sense - it's just that modus ponens still seems like a good idea after being formalized, reflected on, extrapolated out to see if it has sensible consequences, etcetera.

It's not a curse word, stop thinking of feelings as some low level piece of shit. As we have seen earlier, there is nothing else to argue from. Every thing is a feeling, and that is all we have. We realize that feelings are problematic but then there seems to be something we can do. Right now probably the only thing we can do. The only rule of thumb available seems to be the one that Eleizer says,

>The obvious choice isn’t always the best choice, but sometimes, by golly, it is. I don’t stop looking as soon I find an obvious answer, but if I go on looking, and the obvious-seeming answer still seems obvious, I don’t feel guilty about keeping it. Oh, sure, everyone thinks two plus two is four, everyone says two plus two is four, and in the mere mundane drudgery of everyday life everyone behaves as if two plus two is four, but what does two plus two really, ultimately equal? As near as I can figure, four.    
-Eliezer on [Why truth][ele_truth]

> ... Formalize, reflex, extrapolate it to see if it has sensible consequences, etc...

When you see someone tell you that "The snow is white if and only if the snow is white", what do you do?

Although the sentence seems to be giving us trivial information, I think its one of those statements that you choose to accept or not. The snow is white by definition if and only if the snow is white. The snow is said to be white only if the snow is white. It appears like a fundamental statement. It seems to make sense.The snow can be said to be white, if and only if the snow is actually white. The statement the snow is white becomes both the point as well as the if condition. It makes sense, I feel like I understand it. It seems to tell that you have to accept it. There is not much reason. but it seems obvious. There is no other reason why the snow is white. You care for children's lives, if and only if you care for children's lives. 

>Paraphrasing Eleizer, As far as I can figure out 2+2 gives 4. The idea being if you have 2 un-reacting stones, side by side along with 2 more of them, in total you should have 4, and not 3 for example. That is what 2+2 means. Its a facilitator that helps us in daily life to know in advance what we will have in the end. Its a rule of the universe!


#### Lets go for the take

How do you go from here to ...

Let's say there is someone dying in front of you, how much should you be willing to spend for them. Your emotional quotient is at an all time high. Go! Whether or not you seem to have all the tools, what do you do anyway.

From my dicsussion with an STM:

You could spend all your life savings on someone who has the most expensive cancer, and add effectively 100 years of life to the child. But what if you could add more than 100 years of life with the same savings?

Ultimately I am not sure if spending your money on the kid that got you highg emotional quotient, is the right thing to do, as with the same money you could probably save the lives of several others, with certain mild ailments, adding much more than 100 life years to the world. We could maximize many different things such as happiness, life years added, contribution back to the society etc., but what should we do?


#### Utility function

The golden variable that we always try to maximize. 

So it seems that we are tying to maximize something. Are we trying to maximize only happiness? No. we are ready to give up sex, food and money, sometimes, and we might also be ready to take some pain to save someone. Look at gandhi for example, he gave up  everything. Nothing was important to him, people hit him, beat him, but yet he was trying to maximize something. Perhaps the welfare of his folk. Why? What is wrong with him? He also had many 100's of followers atleast, who accompanied him on his way to be beaten jailed. What were they trying to maximize?

For now we call this the utility function, a function with all sorts of variables, which outputs a single number for us to know how our actions have faired. And yes you guessed it right, we have to uncover what is important to this utility function as well. Which variable is scaled high.

The utility function for example can be made of variables such as 'number of happy life years added', 'contribution back to the society', 'number of lives saved now', 'number of lives saved in the future' 

#### Further options

So what do we do... I see that we can go in search of the true value system and maximize it's utility. 
Hail the value system

do what you do? Find yourself in circular preferences. and make shitty decisions regardign children who desparately need your help.

There is no god, and people are streching their hands to the sky, asking someone for help. Little do they know that they are axing you for help. Little did I know that I was being axed help.

or what else?

Suicide?

In the end send the whole of this shit for peerreviewed reasonging.s
Peer-reviewed resonning!


Today I am at work and my team has a bunch of 'stories' in our backlog. We are looking at prioritising each of the stories so we have some way of knowing what is important. My DL just happened to give numbers to every story. If a story has '50' its super important, if a story has '15', then it is not as important as the one that has '50' priority. I understand the reasoning as to why he chose a number, higher than something else. but how do you make a computer do this?

Ultimately its all a feeling. If someone axes you how you came up with a number you can give some reasonsing. If they ask you why its 50 and not 51 or not 52. With the limited capacity of this brain, we do what we can. We leave a lot to the intelligent beings.

With this, I probably shall figure out more in detail about what I need to do. And start my first ever contribution to the Give Well foudnation.

#### Reflection

Often we find ourselves, in a situation when we feel absolutely sleepy, but then we push ourselves for something better, something whose reward might be much further in life. There are cases when feelings is not the only thing we go by. We might feel like shit, and still we might have stuck to what seems right than what is feelings. We are capable of doing this

It's not that we want to be completely happy all the time. Sometimes we are ok with letting go of somthing for someone else. Look at Gandhi, look at batman, look at the several thousand activists who work on their ability to give...


P.S

Was drudging the part where in I had nothing to write baout, and when the momnet came, I found things to write. The goal should not be to write intelligently, but to write quantity. Ideas will come. Be patient?



**Hypothesis**

**Observation:**
I don't feel the proportional pain when I see 1 person die, as when I hear 6.9 million people dying.

What does my value system actually wan't? Does it want me to extrapolate the pain I see for 1 person to 6.9 million people, and take action hence, or does it want me to extrapolate the pain I see from 6.9 million people (basically nothing), to the one person? or Does it wan't me to jsut listen to feelings? 

I could be living in many different type of worlds.




#### Oddity

We want to determine the true value system. What we have currently is a layer of H&B's over it. Isn't what we are seeing H&B's? How can we ever go to the actual value system? 

When 83% of the data pays, couldn't it just be the manifestation of the H&B's playing a cruel trick? This is the part I am not able to digest. 83% of the people donating means that I wan't to save birds, but if those 83% don't pay for more than 2000 birds or more money, then we say H&B's. Painful! An STM, pnn!

Take the intuition wherein you want to save the life of a child who is dying right now, right next to you, who got run over by van. You very well know that you have to pay 10k right now and you won't get it back. But what I just said was hypothetical, whereas in real life, there are millions of children dying. Your intuition wanted to save the dying child now, so you should be atleast saving one child now although the emotional quotient is high?

Well should I just ask my self from within, and get the answer that is best suited? So should I just question myself asking, why it makes a difference if the person is next to me or not. It's a helpless child, why am I calculating what I feel into the picture? when I want that child to be alive?

My second intuition could be right and I have to extrapolate the intuition to the first...

Well you feel too stongly against this?

You also feel too strongly against going shopping should you?
But its just shopping. how can you compare that with saving a life? 

I still cant make sense of the reaonsing I am providing myself regarding this.. I need to define I feel like, something consistant and then go by it. not keep making excuses as they come up. Make the hypothesis before testing it?

our brain has some shortcomings, it can't naturally multiply, it can't naturally compare different situations.



#### What I am worried about

Prejudice!



But now I have already discussed this with my friend, a million times and seen enough footage online, that nowadays, I cry for everything. I cry for every scene in batman, Gandhi! I just need to think of it and bam! Water falls! The point I am trying to make is I am convinced on some level, and I don't want my prejudice to guide me to the answer! But maybe you cant help it or maybe you cam. 
My intuition re
garding saving people is lets say X. and then I feel I want to conclude and this is over. But no, I am afraid, that I already "know the answer" and I might make

Eleizer says, bro, you don't stop looking for an answer once you think something is or feel something is. but then despite further reasoning, observation, rational thought, if it still appears to stay the same then ok!

Lets do the first question we did now with the new reasoning abilities we have gained?


Science can always look at Hueristics and biases are always there to probably tell you better. Better how?


#### The same question

An induvidual child gets significantly more funds than a group of 8 children despite the target group being the same. 

How can it be significantly more better to have 1,312,44
