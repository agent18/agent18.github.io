## Pain begins

A few months back, I started having this pain in my back and
shoulder. I went to the physio, with for 4 weeks and have nothing to
show of it. 

In [this post](/pain-journal.html) I discuss the origin of the pain. Since then I made
a google doc, so that I could log my pain easily. 

With this post, I would like to answer the following:

For shoulder and back, individually.

Am I getting better?

What is causing this pain?

How were the last 7 days?

Different regions and places of pain, even after completely quitting
upper body work outs

Should I quit squats and deadlifts?

Was squats the reason for backpain?

## Weeks 11 to 14 

1-2 times leg press and deadlifts per week; 1 time basketball; 4 days
of 20 mins cardio (220cal)/ week; 3-4 times shoulder physio. 

Stopped upperbody and squat exercises.

## Hypothesis back

**Squats was the reason for back pain when waking up?**

In Week 11 I stop squats. I guess it was quite bad, and that's why I
had to take the last thing that I loved doing. I still do 1-2 times/week of
legpress max and deadlifts max.

Also in week-2 to 3, I only did squats as opposed to doing squats once
and doing leg press the next time. I changed my grip to take it on the
shoulder instead and stopped using the cushion for the shoulder since I went
to India in week -3.

I sleep well nowadays, but with remanants of pain now and then show up.

Conclusion: Squats seems to have reduced the pain. **YES**

**Squats the reason for remnant back pain during work?**

**Not sure**, as they still remain from week 11 to week 14 and even
now as I write this.

Even this Monday I felt the need to massage the shoulders.

**Deadlifts the reason for bad back middle back?**

Already have middle back pain

Week 11.2 --> middle back pain + deadlift eve

Week 12.1 --> deadlift

No written middle back pain

Week 12.5 -->  Middle back pain in the morning. + deadlift eve

Week 13.2 --> Middle back pain

Conclusion for middle back: Seems to be not because of
deadlifts.**No**

**Deadlifts the reason for bad back?**

2/4 days when deadlifts was done, morning wake up was higher pain than
previous day. 

Data might be insufficient. But how about not doing it for a week?

Week 12.5 to 13.4 are the gaps between 2 deadlifts; is better than
Week 13.6 to 14.3. Week 13.5 I did something weird or some gas in my
left back below shoulder. Not the typical pain I experience now and
then.

Would like to conclude that deadlifts are fine, but I will continue to
log.

Therefore: **YES**

**Did stopping upperbody workout help reduce pain in shoulders?**

Week 9.5 upper body was stopped.

Week 11.1 squats was stopped

Not sure, but I remember feeling a decent amount of strain on the shoulders
while maxing out, so I stopped. **Not sure**

**Is basketball causing shoulder pain**

I can only comment about crazy shoulder pain when I can't even lift a
bottle. 

Week 12.7 --> 3 hrs of Bball
Week 13.1 to 13.3  --> cant lift 1.5 kg bottle with extended arm

Week 13.7 --> 3 hrs more intense ball
Week 14.1 to 14.3 --> chill

For now ball is ruled out of heavy pain. So **NO**.

**Did excercise help to reduce pain?**

Not sure but sure as hell feels good. 

I sort of max out. I still do hear clicks in my shoulder when I do
it. I will show my last work out to my Phisio.

**Number of pushups over time**

Week 12.2 --> 4 slow bent pushups "Dont think it is doing better"

Week 12.4 --> 3 + 4(in pain) 

Week 13.1 --> couldn't lift 2 kg using right shoulder, possibly due to
bad sleeping and not 3 hr basketball.

Week 14.2 --> 2 sets --> 1 set all bent pushups (last 4 2ish pain)
                     --> 2nd set 3(bent) + 3 (90deg) stopped by fear.
					 
Week 14.3 --> remanants of shoulder right, seen throughout the day.

**Not clear** if there is improvement or degradation

**summary of regions of pain?**
neck craking seen now a days from time to time, shoulder blades are
sore, can literally feel them, shoulder tops are sore from time to
time, I try to massage them, pain in right shoulder sides is more, not
during work I think.

**Pros**

Sleep well nowadays
Feels like shoulder is better sometimes

**Cons**

Shoulder blades are now visible during work hours, less at wake up
than what was in the begining

Am able to do more pushups, but the pain remaining the next day does
not allow me to conclude anything useful. 

Pain in different parts of the shoulder? what to do?

Still sometimes hear crack while bringing down weights.

I neck crack nowadays. 

Shoulder blades, upper shoudlers are sore from time to time

What about bandages?

## Anamolies

13.1 to 13.3 Shoulder pain where I could not lift weights (not reproducible)

13.4 left middle back gas?

<!--

For the back not clear.

3. basketball is the reason for shoulder injury?

4. Am I getting better? 

How many push ups can you do now?

Can you do squats?

Can you shoulder press and raise?

What about rows?

How is the shoulder pain 1 month back and now

How is the back pain 1 month back and now
