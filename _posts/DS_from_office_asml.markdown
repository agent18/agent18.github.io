	Hi Vaishali, I got your contact through a friend (Ajinkya Daware). I
	am currently looking to see if there are possibilities for me to move
	in this direction and what I would need to do. Would you have any
	ideas? Can we have a short call about it?


2. Shika Mathew

    Hi Shika, I am a close friend of Ajinkya Daware. He informed me
    that you were a data scientist!  I am currently looking to see if
    there are possibilities for me to move in this direction and what
    I would need to do. Would you hvae any ideas?


3. Managers?

alexander Ypma

Hi Alexander, I am from Delft and saw that you are the ambassador for
the Data Science (DS) Community. I am very interested in the field of
DS and am curious how Data Science is spread within ASML. What
branches are working on it, and the type of work done. I was wondering
if we can have a small chat at any time of your convinience?

A little about me:

I am a mechanical designer at ASML currently and have done the
Coursera Capstone 10-set courses in Data Science to see if this is
something I would be interested in. I am particularly interested in
developing my skills in statistics and the scientific method, AB
testing, forming the right hypothesis in the DS realm. And I was
wondering if you can guide me a bit?

Thanks.



Previously I worked on NLP, some simple applications for the Coursera
course like building a shiny applicaiton that shows empiraically what
the CI means.



How is DS structured here in ASML, sanjose
Diff departments, type of teams
What they are workin gon?

Possibilities for people to move from one field to another?

What is needed?

### Discussion with Dimitra Gkorou

**ASML Structure in DS, different teams, different departments, in what aspects are we using DS**

Brion.. roadmap... cymer

**2 core groups**

DS control algorithms --> APPS (customer data)

CSI data science --> MAchine data DUV and EUV

Direct visualization both!

Bi weekly competence meetings 

human in the lopp approaches

Predictive reasoning

**AI for causal reaonsing**

Machine logs, UV potential

**What are the high impact opportunities in ASML in the fields of DS**

physics in ML, 

**What knowledge do I need**

python, ML, Applied statistics (competitive)

PHd ML, masters degree in relevant topic (15-20%)

**Who else can I talk to?**

Meng Dou and Blagorodna (Noni)

Eleftherios and Parisa and Anjan

????

**What sort of jobs I can do?**

**How can I move to that part?**

**My interests**

Statistics
hypothesis testing, coming up with hypothesis
understanding what is needed to solve 
Scientific method
Visualizing communicating, applied machine learnign
Linear algebra, computations
Statistical Sleuth

statistics and the scientific method, AB testing, forming the right
hypothesis in the DS realm

Focus my energy on combining my knowledge in mechanical with that of DS

**Previous work** Previously I have done data science course by
Coursera 10 set course. Capstone in NLP and CI, cleaning extracting,
R, python, matlab all my life.
