## entry question

time, money, examples and probability of getting in FAANG via routes A
(Masters), route b (taking a DS job and going on from there)

## Questions I want answered


  * [ ] How to get into DS FAANG job (blind, payscale, interviews, ask
        people) in California
	
	* [ ] how long before I make it?
  
  * [ ] What about the L1 route? Are there other routes?
  
  * [ ] What about the issues with going with a Masters
  
  * [ ] What salaries do you get as a fresher?
  
  * [ ] Body interview
  
  * [ ] Sid interview
  
  * [ ] Ask Peter hurford some questions?
  
  * [ ] ASML people interview

**Claims**: I will get a job in FAANG after masters

**Example**: Malavika Srinivasan worked 2 years in MuSigma one year as
a Data Science lead, Masters in UC Berkeley and now product manager in
Walmart Labs. Awards during masters for best capstone project. I think
her CS bachelor's from some random place in India. No extra
curriculars I think. grade:?

Karthik Narasimhan worked 2 years in MuSigma, had lots to boast in
this 2 years like working with the COO from Apple etc... masters in
Columbia University, 3.89/4.0 grade (which basically means he got 20%
B and 80% A grades) and now works at Apple. + extra curriculars and
success in sports to get him to Columbia.

I have "1year of Coursera courses" in Data science, a bit of knowledge
in Statistics. Wrote my own time effient NLP algorthm and hosted in on
a site. But I can really work on Kaggle and statistics to up my
chances.


Talk to mallu and compare how close you guys are? grades in masters,
number of hours per day clocked? why not FAANG.

**Definition**: 

**Checklist**: 
 
**Claims**: DS is high paying? how compared to SWe.



## probabilities of getting H1B approved per year

Talk in depth about H1B


Number of times you can apply for H1B: 4 max 2-3 avg

Anectodal evidence suggests: I know only 3 people (jaws husband,
harish and presence) who left back home after not getting their
H1B after 2 years. I know several other people (10-15 mojo, body,
malu, ash, anbu, rithika, husband,jaws, bro, SIL, krishna, preetam,
jockey, 

Ask others for anectodal evidence: 

simple calc: 85k available (65k regular + 20k advanced)

> Here’s the breakdown of H1B Visa Applications from USCIS

> 95,885 were submitted towards the cap exemption of 20,000 for holders
> of U.S. advanced degrees, and 94,213 were submitted towards the
> standard quota of 65,000.  Advanced-degree H1B Visa petitions had a
> 21% chance of selection in the advanced-degree lottery.
>
> All remaining H1B Visa cases had a 38% chance of selection in the
> Regular Cap lottery.

---https://www.happyschools.com/h1b-visa-2020-probability-lottery/

21% chance of getting in advanced degree
38% of getting in regulat 
51% chance of making it if you start at the advanced (21%+79%*38%=51%)

https://bintlr.work/h1bProbabilityEstimate.html

Estimates as 41% chance of getting H1B if grad pool is 50%. Lesser
grad pool percentage more.

Now the chance of someone getting in after applying 1 time 2 times and
3 times is? The chance that someone makes it it one of the three
attempts is?


--- anectodally friend has never heard of a case where all three years
someone missed.

78% chance over 3 times of application to get H1B. Apparently getting
this doesn't actually mean you are approved. There is another stage
which is the RFE stage. Understand this part???

Still other things like loosing job or being fired and finding jobs
within 3 months etc... Brother did it. PKP did it. Don't know of cases
who got fucked. It looks like worth the chance. Be insanely great is
the only thing I should think of?

## H1B rejections

The lottery is one thing that puts a cap on the amount of times you
are able to apply for H1B. After you are selected in the lottery,
based on some method, you are either approved or rejected or requested
for an [RFE](https://goh1b.com/en/blog/2019/07/02/what-does-h1b-rfe-mean-most-common-reasons/). The cases for denial have become "much higher" [(33%
in 2019 from 10% in 2016)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2019/08/08/latest-uscis-data-show-increase-in-denials-for-new-h-1b-visas/#5443e3417cc4) over the trump era and one of the things
they seem to be scrutinizing the people for not having the **right
background/experience for the work** they are doing. Naturally this
scares me. This comes under "Beneficiary qualifications". Another
common issue seen is called "Speciality Occupation". The **position
needs to qualify as a speciality occupation**. Apparently[ USCIS does
not usually think a job is "special enough", if they don't seem to
have the need of relevant bachelor's](https://ogletree.com/insights/uscis-issues-top-10-reasons-for-h-1b-requests-for-evidence/). So a Bachelor's or its
equivalent in a particular speciality. If you look on [trackitt](https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/h1b),
you do see that "most" of the rejects are cited based on this
"Specialty Occupation" or "lack of relevant degree" (Beneficiary
qualifications I presume).

In some cases they have been plain mean, by rejecting H1B's directly
without RFE even. Apparently [this guy (Amazon L6 SDE)](https://www.teamblind.com/post/H1b-extension-rejections-for-FAANG-Senior-software-engineers8-yoe-t5obBBbF) was
rejected despite his 10+ years of experience, maybe because of non-CS
background in India, despite having a "very special job" (that paid
him 320k TC).

A brief notion of history is that Trump took office in Jan 2017 and by
2018 Nov there are reported cases of people being sent back home
because their degree was not good despite being Amazon L6 SDE
([expected to earn 320k](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Google-L4-vs-AWS-L6-qjcKjoYm)) with 10+ yoe ([same guy as
above](https://www.teamblind.com/post/H1b-extension-rejections-for-FAANG-Senior-software-engineers8-yoe-t5obBBbF)). Could be much before, but validity of cases considered
further is based on atleast nov,2018. There are [cases in
trackitt](https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/discuss/h1b/25257) much earlier than that (Mar 2018).

Also by the end of this year I should have two concrete cases for the
following claims in case things change.

In case I choose the Masters route, is it a thing where people get
rejected ?
In case I choose the L1 route will I be rejected like that guy becuz I
don't got no DS cedrics and only potentially 2-3 years of exp?


**Claims**: Despite having ~~another~~ masters in relevant field,
having bachelor's in other fields results in H1B rejections.

**Evidence (Approvals)**:  

- "... I've done BS in mechanical and masters in information systems
myself no prob so far, 2 jobs since initial H1... I applied for H1B
extension in dec 2019 and got it stamped"---[ronaldo7!](https://www.teamblind.com/post/6mTKzvNm). He is
Indian too and works in Dealer Socket.

I don't have any other examples in this format. But what I find is
people with master's in non-relevant degree are managing getting H1B
APPROVED. I then think it is axiomatic that the claim being addressed
holds. They get an RFE but they are able to navigate through it to
approval.

- "I have an EE degree, got RFE for transfer to FANG. Took multiple CS
courses in masters so have responded ... Specialty occupation, ee
degree is unrelated was the reasons ... I did thankfully get an
approval on my RFE".---[wFatDuck](https://www.teamblind.com/post/H1b-extension-rejections-for-FAANG-Senior-software-engineers8-yoe-t5obBBbF). I don't know which country he is
from. He is a fresh H1B case though.

- "One of my friends is BS and MS in mechanical engineering he switched
jobs between Adobe, Roku and Amazon in 1.5yrs no probs so far
"---[ronaldo7!](https://www.teamblind.com/post/6mTKzvNm). "My friend had a year of contract experience
(software) before joining a startup that was bought by Adobe" and "I
applied for H1B extension in dec 2019 and got it stamped". Both are
Indians. 


Case 2: H1B Extension applied in PP in October 2017; Working for
Consulting firm - EVC model and Client provided Client letter; Got RFE
for Speciality Occupation & Employee-Employer relationship & Wage
Level 1 justification; Approved last week after responding to RFE; BE
in EEE, MS in EE, 4.5 Years Experience all of which is with same
Consultant and since graduation; Job requires BE in CS or related
field with 2 or more years experience - Wage Level 1, Software
Developer is the job title;---[here](http://forum.murthy.com/topic/113510-any-successful-h1-extension-with-electronics-or-mechanical-engineering-background/?do=findComment&comment=431827)


**Conclusion**: False; Bachelor seems to not matter if you have a
relevant masters (or if you don't have relevant masters)

**Claims**: Having non-relevant highest education causes H1B
rejections.

  the basis of "Special occupation" and "degree relevant to job".
  
- "I recently heard about an Amazon L6 SDE with 10+ yoe, whose visa

- "One of my friends is BS and MS in mechanical engineering he
switched jobs between Adobe, Roku and Amazon in 1.5yrs no probs so far
"---[ronaldo7!](https://www.teamblind.com/post/6mTKzvNm). "My friend had a year of contract experience

- Data Scientist III in Amazon currently. Electrical Engineering

- "I went from meche to CS with a mech-e MS (after 3 years working on
radio hardware). (I went to bloomberg 3 years after that). My h1b
petition went through three rounds of RFEs trying to prove the
relatedness between my degree and the new job.*I know many others who
came to Bloomberg without a CS degree*"---[supernoob](https://www.teamblind.com/post/H1B-Rejection-MechE-to-DataScience-FAANG-US-c3QbZaoW). Korean
working now in Bloomberg. He writes some nice points on how he wrote
his RFE to direct the staff of USCIS.  "It was on shaky grounds. I
found a few uni courses where I proved that I did comp sci
stuff. Think of stuff like doing structure analysis and engine
analysis. In those classes, I used mathmatrica and Matlab and stuff
like that so my lawyers made a case that my degree involved CS... One
thing I should add here is that most of my relevant CS experience came
from working on open source projects, writing Android apps, and web
apps, but these are not evidence points I could use for my h1b case
unfortunately"

- "I have an EE degree, got RFE for transfer to FANG. Took multiple CS
courses in masters so have responded ... Specialty occupation, ee
degree is unrelated was the reasons ... I did thankfully get an
approval on my RFE".---[wFatDuck](https://www.teamblind.com/post/H1b-extension-rejections-for-FAANG-Senior-software-engineers8-yoe-t5obBBbF). I don't know which country he is
from. He is a fresh H1B case though.

- Mechanical engineer in CS, 3 yoe in the US, 12 yoe total. Working in
  Network and Computer Systems Administrators (15-1142). Wage
  level 4. RFE: Education related. ---[trackkit](https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/discuss/h1b/25910)
  
- Full time, Level-4, Senior Java APM Expert. Offered salary is way
above the minimum wage standards. Non-IT background - Electrical and
Power systems. ---[trackkit](https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/discuss/h1b/25295)

**Conclusion**: Looking at this it appears to be random. It's not in
my hand and that it is random. For example a combination of lawyers'
replies to RFEs and moods of the operator at USCIS could potentially
toss the results left and right. But I still look back at the titles
of the issue being "speciality occupation", and "degree relevant to
the job". So I still have my bets that getting a relevant degree could
be beneficial. And should pursue it to "increase my chances".

This is from a Hiring manager at Amazon explaining what a giant
cluster fuck of a mess it is: "One of my report’s visa was rejected
saying the job is not a specialty occupation and doesn’t need
bachelors degree which is ridiculous as why would Amazon pay that
person $300K per year for a non-specialty job.  The decision on visa
application has become so arbitrary that the outcome is not known.
One employee has one application rejected and the same application was
approved the second time."---[hiring manager Amazon](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Immigration-Mess-sAYGCXgg)


**Claims**: If non-relevant higher education then people try to
compensate with higher yoe?

Ya not going to get into it.

I think this is all far fetched to conclude and no clear pattern seems
to exist. There are cases of rejections with many yoe and no yoe;
relevant masters and non relevant masters, etc...

**Claims**: OPT to H1B even at FAANG

There could be other reasons for rejection like, random factors,
officer who does your process, whether it is a transfer or extension
process, job code, lawyers, RFE explanations, IT companies worked with
in the past, history of working with consultancies etc... But atleast
there are a few cases where Mech degree seems to still be fine to move
into CS. And the rest seem to be beyond my control and the best you
can do is give your best and leave it at that. So I guess I would use
the p(RFE rejection rates for these beyond my control
events). Perfect.

https://www.teamblind.com/post/FAANG-that-accepts-candidate-with-less-than-24-month-OPT-46DqLqvB

Only Google and Amazon accept people with 1 h1b attempt. Fb wont even
hire with 2 H1B attempts.

## Conclusion on RFE (probabilities)

So it turns out that there is no clear pattern with masters or
yoe. But because the rejections are based on "speciality occupation"
and "relevant degree", I am still going to side with doing a masters
in DS atleast and having yoe, but am not worried that all along I was
in MechE earlier and that it is going to affect me.

There could be other reasons for the rejections seen like, random
factors, officer who does your process, whether it is a transfer or

control and the best you can do is give your best and leave it at
that. So I guess I would use the p(RFE rejection rates for these
beyond my control events). Perfect.

The probability of getting a FAANG job seems to be:

1. P(getting H1B lottery in any of the attempts): 80%

	A person on a STEM OPT can apply 3 times on H1B lottery over three
    different years.  The probability of getting in the advanced
    category (masters and above) in one of the three attempts, seems
    to be 80%. The probability of getting selected in the common pool
    is 65% in any one of the three attempts. Corresponding one attempt
    values are 41.9% and 30.1% respectively. This assumes a [50% split
    between general pool and advanced pool](https://www.happyschools.com/h1b-visa-2020-probability-lottery/). Personally these
    numbers look plausible to me as anecdotaly, I know only 2 people
    who didn't get H1B in all their attempts and I know 15-20 people
    who made it and are in good jobs, now with their H1B scene sorted.
	
	Note: Some companies do not hire you in your OPT if you don't have
    [atleast 2 attempts](https://www.teamblind.com/post/FAANG-that-accepts-candidate-with-less-than-24-month-OPT-46DqLqvB). Also there is a possibility of applying
    with many H1B sponsors for the same year with different
    employers. So lets assume I have 3 tries for now.
	
2. P(getting approved after clearing the H1B): 62.7%

	https://www.fragomen.com/insights/alerts/report-confirms-significant-increase-h-1b-and-l-1-rfe-and-denial-rates

	[According to Fragoman](https://www.fragomen.com/insights/alerts/latest-uscis-data-confirm-continued-high-rates-nonimmigrant-rfes-and-denials-fy-2019), 84% of the people get approved after
	being selected in the lottery. In my case I am going to assume
	that for sure I get an RFE as the people I have talked to have
	gotten an RFE and the cases I see are more of what I relate
	to. 39.6% get an RFE and 62.7% of that get approval.

	As suggested earlier, this whole process seems to have a lot of
	random factors. There seems to be a high chance that I will get an
	RFE as the cases I saw who got RFE resonate with my
	background. And I hence suggest I take the above values.

	This means that the probability of getting approved after clearing
	the H1B is 62.7%.
	
3. P(of doing well enough in masters and landing a job in US based on
   skills) = 85%

	I have seen cases "similar to mine" who after 2 years of intense
    work-ex in India did a masters and without any qualms landed a job
    in Apple and Walmart. I assume the chances are pretty good as I am
    going to work my ass off "like them". Also I barely know of cases
    who had to leave the country once they went there. I would say 1-2
    cases out of 15-20 people and that too because of Visa Issues. So
    I think the chances are good here of completing it.
	
3. P(finding an L1able route and leave to the US) = 60%-80%

	Finding and getting L1/direct-H1B opportunity. I know cases of
	people doing this route. People who are "probably" very
	good. People in finance with and without an MBA (from India) now
	in New York in Investment Banking (after 2 years in banking or a
	4yoe). 
	
	Finding someone to sponsor H1B while on L1. People have done
    this. A good friend of mine managed to pull this off with Apple.
	
	I cannot come up with estimates, I am unable to find other people
    in the same boat. And even if I do, I am not sure if I can
    translate that into any statistics on it unless there is already
    some statistics on say frogoman. BUT PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT. One
    reason I was told are that "they were good enough to demand an L1
    opportunity after one year (from India)", "Express your interest to
    the upper management", "be really good",  (of the four people I spoke to)
	
	So for this route I think I might need to do
	MIDS (in parallel) or something like that on the side to lessen my
	fear of rejection at RFE. I don't know anyone who has done
	this. But I could possibly find more info on this on Linkedin. But
	later is also good. I know people who have done it in various
	fields. For example Y media labs has good presence in US and India
	and that was one friends route from Mechanical to US in
	CS. Another guy worked in as backend for firm in NewYork and is
	now there in Investment Banking and making "good money". So these
	guys usually get one opportunity there to say hi and then they
	score with that is what I have heard from them.
	
	So I will have to look for an L1able company get employed and plot
    my way (I don't know how). I am positive ASML is useless in this
    aspect. I spoke to a couple of people and no one seems to
    recognize such possibilities. But there is should be several
    companies. From the people I have been speaking to, there seem to
    be many cases of people in India moving to US, being good back in
    India and showing intent to learn. My guess is to follow such a
    recipe and hope for the best. 
	
	How to do it is something that I can still invest in...
	
	There ought to be companies that might be interested in pushing
    people to the US or who work closely with the US. I need to find
    them and move to them. I have seen people do it in India, and
    worst case I could also do that or move to locations of companies
    in and out of Europe. Once I am "decent" this field. Doing an
    online masters is not really a showstopper. I think I can do that
    with good odds. NP. It will cost money for example MIDS costs 13k
    per semester (WTF!!!) for an online course.
	
	Regarding if I need to do a masters or not, I would like more
    examples of people who have done it without a masters and pursued
    the L1 route. Currently that is the only thing that will convince
    me I guess. I have time to get such info. I could always figure
    out a way to do part-time masters here or after I am on L1.
	
	There is more uncertainty here, I should acknowledge, if my L1
    will be granted without having 3yoe in DS. Rejection of L1 application.
	
4. P(!recession ending my H1B career altogether while apping) = 90%
   (based on the last 20 years)
   
   My friends seem to have the opportunity to come back on an L1 after
   working 1 year. I think the thing to focus on again seems to be to
   be really great at what you are doing. 
   
   There are other probabilities such as keeping the job, not being
   laid off in the next recession etc... which is also weak. Assuming
   I am not going to marry, it fully depends on me to keep my
   chances. not sure how to evaluate it. For now focus on being great
   so that you are one of them people who can manage.   
   
5. Total P(getting a FAANG job in the Masters route) =
   80%x62.7%x85%x90% = 38.3%.
   
   Common man! freaking 38.3 poucent
   
6. Total P(getting a FAANG in the L1 route) = 80%x62.7%x(60)%x90% = 27% 

	Jesus man! what kind of probabilities are these? Unfortunately
    this is what it is. If I can do an average of 150k donations
    every-year that will be insane but with such probabilities is
    about 57k. Fuck me.! 
	
	A data engineer with a Masters in Us and 2 years experience abck
    in india is able to already get 300kTC. I mean the money is
    insane, if there is ever hope of hitting half a million dollars I
    think it can be done, here. This gives massive donation potential.
	
	
### Risk assesment.

L1 route to a H1B (with some online masters), and Masters route to a
H1B, or even a Canadian PR route to H1B have all different
probabilities. But the base probability of getting the H1B seems to be
the same. Proceeding in each of the routes has some pros and
cons. Let's list them:

- planning fallacy: Note that people are always super optimistic about
  shit in life. Even the worst case scenario prediction was not met
  with a resounding 90% of the class but with 50% [citation
  needed]. So all numbers (although they look disgustingly low), could
  be lower as I am only predicting the "worst-case-scenario". 
  
- More uncertainties not taken into account like, companies [not
  wanting to take the change to hire people with H1B applications](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Immigration-Mess-sAYGCXgg)
  or [people with OPT getting lesser chances](https://www.teamblind.com/post/FAANG-that-accepts-candidate-with-less-than-24-month-OPT-46DqLqvB) to qualify for an H1B
  at companies as companies see very low probability in it.

- My worries with Masters route is the cost and the lack of
  contingencies in case it all blows up in my face (which according to
  my calculation has decent probability). Then I would be down by
  50-70k atleast and would be in debt, which would take 5 years of
  decent savings in NL before I pay it back. 
  
  A friend of mine suggested that if she didn't make it this year in
  her extension then the company would help her by giving her a job
  elsewhere and bring her back in a year. So there is still hope that
  you can still re-spawn, but we don't know the odds of that happening
  and the only thing I have to go by is "to be good" and let
  everything else rest on chance.
  
- My worries with the L1 route, is first finding an L1able company and
  working in US that allows me to go to the US, meanwhile finding
  other companies that will sponsor my H1B. I might have to spend
  considerably (5x13k) for a online-masters, but if I do my masters while on
  L1, then it should be easy to take care of the funding for it.
  
- With Master's there is the OPT --> H1B uncertainty but then you can
  keep working while they look for your H1B. With L1 route, if you
  stay in the same company, the company apps for your H1B and you
  still work with them. Whereas when you are trying to move to FAANG,
  then they seemed to not be interested in a friend (because they have
  to wait till october) because it takes time before they can have
  you. So there might be particular times only when you can apply
  (considering that H1B transfers also take 4 months). 
  
- Timing wise I will reach 300k in 4-6 years from now (2-3 years work-ex)
  in the masters route (this is what happened with friends in DS). 
  
  Timing wise I will reach 300k in (2-3 yoe (india) and on L1 --> and
  then change + 4-5 years trying to find H1B) 6-8 years. I am trying to be so
  optimistic here, it took take longer man I am yet to even start
  becoming good in DS. Sounds like a joke to me. Worst case another 2
  years. 
  
- Expected donations with an average of 150k ([50% donations based on
  Jeff Kaufman's capabilities](https://www.jefftk.com/donations)). 
  
  I thought this estimate to be too optimistic. [With 150k donations
  you get back say 36k](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=40). There seems to be a cap of 50% on
  deductible donations. For the 150k left it gets taxed at 30% in
  california, so you have 100k for expenditure + the 36k. Seems like
  plenty for savings and living. :) People live for far less in
  cali. So I think this should be possible.

Seems like it could be an OPT timing issue. But this is not a H1B rejection

### H1B positives

Having a degree seems to help after RFE
