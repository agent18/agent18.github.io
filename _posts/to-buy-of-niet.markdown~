#### Problems with Dell Latitude E5430

- Ram is low when using multiple tabs on chrome
- 2 year life
- cannot sleep over night, always needs a charging usually. Could be
software related.
- It looks like am going to be doing DS so might need decent ram to
  prep and do courses with some extra visualization.(I suspect)
- Cant play games
- Needs to be returned asap.

#### Pros

- Ubuntu setup is ready
- Laptop is movable and looks stirdy enough to go on for the next 2
  years!



#### arg for buying
- I have to buy it now or I am going to be losing 200 bucks
- Urgency comes hence!
- I need a computer with 8 gig ram atleast and at it I would like a
  proper graphics card t
  


#### arg agains buying

- I don't know if I should be gaming! and investing for it
- Money, why spend 900 bucks! fuck me!
- Gaming consumes lot of time. 
	
	
#### Why are you really buying a laptop?

Would not buy a laptop with a decent enough graphics card and 8 gb
ram?

Well if I put in some more money I can buy a gaming laptop, so why
not. For a few more hundred I can get more !


### Buying laptop in india

It appears that I might save 100 bucks. and will haev to go through a
lot of struggle to ensure saving that. 

100 bucks I spent without thinking in so many places. It is not really
worth that much to me. And I don't want to be spending time looking at
how to save that! Nahmean

Plus here I can return try etcc... as needed. Which I prefer, as I
don't know what works and what doesn't with ubunut dual booting and
stuff!

If I buy in india, then I ahve to return it there, and cannot have
more than 2 iterations, and that will already be pushing it.

### Spedngin time on discounts

max I should be able to get 50 bucks of discount!

#### To check

Warranty, guarentee, return policy confirmation

Check on tweakers for lowest price!

#### Difference between gaming and normal laptop?
