I am going to go step by step with the 80k blog and see where it takes me. I see there are lot of great points, amazingly evidence based. I would like to read about it and summarize the contents to my liking. Based on the old articles, it is clear to us that we want to use our time in the best way possible to create as much as impact as possible. This could mean donating 10k euros a year or 


#### Dream job


>Some people imagine that the answer involves discovering their passion through a flash of insight, while others think that the key elements of their dream job are that it be easy and highly paid.

>We’ve reviewed two decades of research into the causes of a satisfying life and career, drawing on over 60 studies, and we didn’t find much evidence for these views.

Boom! fuck everything about passion and 'what makes you happy' and all the associated shit. 

> You're passion can lead you astray

You might want to become an ice cream vendor or a bus driver. Screw that shit!

A dream job would have the [following][ling4]:

1. You would be working on something you are good at

1. Your work would have direct(saving lives directly) or indirect impact (donations)

1. [Flow][motivation] while working; lack of major negatives (unfair pay); supportive colleagues

#### Shaking the foundation of everything you know?

> the evidence suggests that money and avoiding stress aren’t that important.
#### You can be wrong

Deep down you don't know what you want to do. We make wrong decisions all the time. 

> We are bad at predicting what will make us happy

> It turns out we’re even bad at remembering how satisfying different experiences were


#### Stress
Stress has always been viewed as harmful in the past. One of the things that I think about while thinking of doing a job in the USA is Stress, pressure from your seniors to get work done at. As a side note another thing I worry about doing is working long hours. My belief being that I might have to forgo my time at the gym or my time working on other important things outside. 

Kelly Mcgonical (beauty and brains), quotes 3 studies to make a point about stress.

1. 30k people tracked regarding how stressed they were in the last year and if they viewed stress as harmful to their health. Based on who died using public records, they understood that people who viewed stress as not harmful, had the lowest risk of dying.

The text basically does not talk about life satisfaction but says that the way we think about stress can increase life expectancy. Life expectancy is a great thing but what about how you feel during the moments of stress is important. Do people who live really long have great life satisfaction? Does it mean they loved the work they did? Does it mean they lived a fulfilling life? 

Maybe it is possible to understand from this that they didn't let stress take over their lives. Listen to what kelly says next

OMG 43% increased risk of dying if you had a lot of stress! Only if stress is harmful for your health.

> 182K AMERICANS DIED not from stress but from the belief that STRESS is HARMFUL.

> Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier? YES YES YES. Changing mind about stress, changes bodies response to stress...

> What if you viewed something stressful as  signs that your body is energized, was preparing you to meet this challenge? Study at Harvard uni while making a social stress stress. Pounding heart is preparing you for action; Breathing fasster well, more O2 to your brain. Participants who learned to view their stress response as helpful for their performance less stressed out, less anxious, more confident. A change in the way your bloodvessels react in when you think stress is helpful is that it does not constrict anymore liek in stressful situations. And this is the thing, apparently it looks a lot like what happenes when in moments of joy and courage.

> This is my body helping me to rise to the challenge 


> Stress makes you social

Pitutary gland pumps oxytocin, a harmone that increases empathy, makes you crave physical contact,

Ocytocin is motivating you to seek support

Your biological stress reposnse wants to make sure you are able to notice others in struggle so you can support each other.

When life is difficult you stress repsonse wants you to be surrounded by people

Oxytocin protects your CVS from stress,   it helps heart cells re-generate and heal from any stress induced damage

Benifits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support

When you seek support or help someone else in this situation you release oxytocin... Stress response becomes healthier  and you recover fastre from stress

Stress resposne has stress resillence which is the human connection!

Study 3:
Caring created resillience

Harmful effects of stress in your helath are not inevitable

How you think and how you act can transform 

Helpful stress response, biology of courage

when you connect with others under stress, you can create resillience 

> When you choose to view stress in this way, you are not just getting better at stress, you are telling yourself that you can trust you to handle all the life-challenges and you are remembering that you don't have to face them alone.

> Helping others in stress 


>Go after what is creating meaning in your life, and then trust yourself to handle what follows

## Stress

#### Why are we talking about stress? 

I have been afraid about stress. Stress can kill apparently. Should I be concerned? 

What I actually want is to be useful/productive for a prolonged period of time in human services whether be it earning to give or research or directly solving a problem. I think it would be hard for me to work in a very stressful environment for the rest of my life or even a year or two. By that I mean what?

#### What do you mean by stress?

There are two vivid cases of stress I can imagine.

Case what I would not want to be is when I was asked to ..

These are the type of situations I want to avoid.

I was not really stressed while doing masters, or writing exams. Just that I worked hard and stuff, spent long hours to get shit done. 

I want to stress(pun-intended), that for me maybe working long hours might not be the problem but I need some things. Why?  and what things? Because basically I have put a lot of hours all my life more than the regular 8 hrs. During my GATE studies, I went to college and came back home and studied for the courses. Weekends were packed as well. During my days as a project associate in IIT I found myself working many nights continuously to get a paper out (12-16 hrs for 10 days straight). During this time I had to pull many all nighters. I have done it. I guess the stressful part for me was not making mistakes or making mistakes and correcting for them. This is all there was to IIT. I want to avoid this. All through my masters I put in a good amount of time/day on getting work done. My thesis, I guess I easily  did 10 hrs a day and wait for it... almost all days a week, without any sort of vacation. My time was valuable as fuck, and I was not planning on wasting any part of it. I had to get best grades and finish the thesis within record time. At my current work right now, although sometimes it is boring to work, the last week I was really investigating something, failing a lot. Many days, I just went back home becasue I was not paid to do it or that the gym closes soon and I have to be at the gym. I would have been happy to spend time and get to the bottom of the issue say if I was paid for extra hours. Here working extra hours is going to get me nothing other than make me closer to closure. I could just come and continue the work the next day, no questions asked. Working extra hours perhaps doesn't generate enough extra value needed. If this was my thesis, I was the sole shareholder and I would have not cared one bit how much time I was spending. Work done was more important for me. Working 9 hrs a day for 5 days a week does not seem bad atall. 

Vacations? Well during IIT I didn't really take a vacation. 2 years! During masters somehow at the end of a year, I just try to leave somewhere to avoid feeling lonely. During work now, I haven't taken a vacation and now I feel bad taking such a long vacation of 5 weeks in decemeber.

I can work long hours if I am paid good enough? 


Sometimes when I am stressed or anxious, I don't feel like doing anything. This precisely takes me to 2 moments in my life. One is when I kept making mistakes and had to confess to my boss at IIT and the other is when I was about to loose money on a house.

Stress has always been viewed as harmful. 

[Kelly Mcgonigal's take on stress][stress_kelly] towards the very end of her lecture is this

> "Go after what is creating meaning in your life, and then trust yourself to handle what follows"

What all classifies as creating meaning in your life I am not sure. I am really pissed with people using such words. Atleast help me with examples.

Kelly bases her understanding on 3 studies.

1. 30k people tracked regarding how stressed they were in the last year and if they viewed stress as harmful to their health. Based on who died using public records, they understood that people who viewed stress as not harmful, had the lowest risk of dying.

2. Study at Harvard where there was a control group and a test group, with the tes group being told that stress is not harmful. The cardiovascular profile looks like the profile of someone with courage and joy

3. A study of x people pointing to the fact that caring created resillience, when you "connect" with others in stress 

> When you choose to view stress in this way, you are not just getting better at stress, you are telling yourself that you can trust you to handle all the life-challenges and you are remembering that you don't have to face them alone.
