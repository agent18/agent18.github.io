Peter McIntyre, writes (paraphrasing):

It looks like a good idea to visit EA hubs for things like reducing
Value reduction. And the potential it has on your life.

## Plot

But what is the central question.

So industries cluster in certain regions. Great! And in these regions,
boy oh boy, do we have those ambitious people. We would like to be
around such ambitious people cause they persuade us to be
ambitious. We see that EA is clustering around SFO and Oxford. Bay
Area seems to be the better hub (happening etc...).

I need to be around my hub I think, maybe take a trip to the hub. Meet
people, network just like the 14 Australians did. I want to go to
ambitious cities. I want to persuaded to do great things. I want my
value to not be reduced. 

Caveats: You will meet ambitious people more than you do here. I am
totally afraid so. With the

It's only when I meet my colleagues here do I think I should put extra
effort and gain their respect. Its when I see them leading teams is
when I try to be like them, be in control. I think of being like them.

## Replot


## Industries Cluster in certain areas

**Youtubers**

Three-quarters of the US entertainers live in LA. There is even a
building at [1600 Vine street in Hollywood LA, where internet stars
moved into to pursue fame](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/business/hollywood-apartment-social-media.html). A quick look at the early life of some
of the top Youtubers reveals that most of them have moved to LA to
"further their career". 

David Dobrik moved to LA from Illinois to pursue his Vine Career,
right after high school. Right now he has 6 million views everyday and
has risen to 15 million subscribers in a matter of 4 years. At the
time he moved to LA (at the age of 19), groceries of 25<span>$</span>
was a lot of money. Today he can be seeing buying his friends
Lamborginis even.

Lily Singh moved in December 2015 to LA all the way from
Toronto. Today she is the first woman late night talk show host. 

Liza Koshy, from Houston, King Bach from Toronto, Logan and Jake Paul
from Ohio, Amanda Cerny from Pennsylvania etc... All of them are some
top youtubers (>10million subs) and all of them moved to LA.

Often times I have seen in videos of Logan Paul where he makes people
move to LA. He did this with his friend Mark Dohner, his current
roommates Mike Majlak and Evan. All with the intention that somehow
the key to a greater life is in the city. 

**Talk shows**

Most hot and happening talk shows are recorded here in California:
"The Late Late show with James Corden", "Jimmy Kimmel Live",
"Conan". All, in or around 20 mins from California. Why do they all
have to be this close? Maybe, it is where people come to look for this
type of work, or maybe the people who are interviewed in these shows
are easier to reach, or whatever. But somehow they seem to want to
flock together.

However, "Last week tonight", "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah", "The
late show with Stephen Colbert", are all filmed in NYC. You can go
ahead and guess that the "Saturday Night Live" would also be taped in
NYC. Unlike the shows that are taped in California, these shows are
all politically charged. Why NYC? Maybe that is where they have the
right type of audience, or interviewees or even time zone w.r.t
Washington, which is somehow important. I don't know. 

**Art**

> Florence. From the 13th to the 16th century it was a seemingly

> website](http://www.aboutflorence.com/art-and-culture-of-Florence.html)

Somehow, Florence has been producing the most important works of art
consistently over 3 centuries despite Milan also being from Italy and
just as big and 350 km apart.

**Finance**

If you look at New York, it appears that it is the "Investment capital
of the world". New York is where the [Largest revenue investment
banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_investment_banks) are. Many big banks have their HQ there (Goldman Sachs, JP
Morgan and Chase, Morgan Stanley, BofA) for example. Yes there are
other "Large" banks like Barclays Investment Bank, whose headquarters
are in London. A quick look into their revenue dwarfs in comparison to
the Goldman Sachs for example. I am not saying the reason why they
"suck" is because of their location. But the fact that they are not
totally big and not in New York isn't helping its case here.

**Technology giants**

The Tech giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google, UBER, Lyft, Nvidia,
Intel, Instagram, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Twitter, Netflix, Y-combinator,
Tesla, Airbnb, PayPal, SpaceX, Stripe, Snap, Udacity are all in the
Silicon Valley with their headquarters. Somehow Amazon, Microsoft are
not mainly in Silicon valley. They do have a small presence there. For
example, Microsoft has only 2000 employees out of its 145k employees
in California. But the rest seem to be flocking in here.

**EA**

The most interesting for me is the EA community. I want to see if they
are clustering or what is it they are doing.

In the EA side the "top" organizations that 80khours has listed
[here](https://80000hours.org/2018/10/2018-talent-gaps-survey/#who-was-sampled), GiveWell (San Francisco), Open Philanthropy project (San
Franscisco), 80khours (Oxford and SF), Open AI (SF), MIRI (Berkeley),
Center for Applied Rationality (Berkeley), AI Impact (Berkeley),
Animal Charity Evaluator (Berkeley without any office space), Evidence
Action (Washington DC), Center for study of existential risk
(Cambridge), Future of Humanity Institute (Cambridge, UK), Global
Priorities Institute (Oxford), Sentience Institute (London), Giving
What We Can (Oxford). These are other top organizations listed by
GiveWell: Against Malaria Foundation (St. Albans UK), Helen Keller
International (Washington D.C), Sightsavers (U.K), Others: Give
Directly (NYC), Poverty Action Lab (Cambridge, MA, US), Good Food
Institute (Washington D.C, US), Animal Equality (US UK), Center for
Global Development (Washington D.C, US), Founders Pledge (London).

80khours and Centre for Effective Altruism went through the
[Y-combinator startup program in 2015 and 2017](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/) respectively. At
that point 80khours even moved to Silicon Valley and not has a small
presence there i.e., two of the 8 people work there.

So for the EA community it looks like UK and Bay Area could be
considered as hubs I guess. These regions also host the [annual EA
conferences](https://www.eaglobal.org/).

**Tech in my region**

I currently live in Delft. When I lost my job in Delft, there were a
number of people contacting me and saying I needed to move to
Eindhoven and sure enough I had most of my interviews there. All the
top companies related to semiconductor industry are clustered around
Eindhoven (for some reason). ASML, Philips, NXP and many contracted
medium sized companies working for them and a gazillion recruitment
agencies working for them. And right now am working in delft and it
appears that the lack of being in Eindhoven is seriously affecting
me. I look at people who go to Eindhoven often or people who are in
Eindhoven getting better responsibilities, knowing about traineeships
through their network etc... I am literally unable to network to find
out opportunities.

**Malls/Supermarkets in my region**

Malls Hello? In Forum mall, somehow PUMA, NIKE, Reebok, and Adidas are
literally next to each other. SIDE BY SIDE. Hmm! Same thing with those
shirt brands like Louie Philip, Peter England, Van Heusen. It makes
sense in this case though I guess. I literally went to all the stores
for shopping shoes everytime I need to buy shoes or shirts. I step
foot into all stores. And they are all in the same Mall. Anyways from
a sale perspective lets say it makes money for them. 

In the city where I live, there are three-four Turkish stores in the
same "street", where we get Indian Masalas for example and there is no
more anywhere else in the city. Similarly, the center of the city has
the largest collection of Restaurants (fine dining types).

## Great Cities attract ambitious people 

**Silicon Valley as startup and tech hub**

In a region like Silicon Valley the Tech and startup hub, there seems
to be a lot of attraction from ambitious people.

There is little doubt that Silicon Valley is a great region as it is
the biggest funding pot for startups with 140B<span>$</span>-- from
2012 to 2018-- funded from 2012 to 2018. This is 3.8 times bigger than
the next top funding hub Boston. This seems to be attracting top minds
(as evidenced by the success) to its region.

A top example is Facebook. The current tech giant in 2004, was passed
on by Battery Ventures from Boston after two meetings at Charles and
one last meeting at their offices, it still didn't work out. Whereas
the meeting with Peter Thiel in California led to a deal in a
day. Apparently Boston VCs are slow and afraid to make those big hits
that could potentially get you big returns. Whereas Silicon Valley
valley boast otherwise. As a result, Paul Graham can be seen preaching
to startups during his Y-Combinator Boston rounds that they need to
move to Silicon Valley to have the biggest bet for success.

Looking at the tech world we see that in the last few decades the top
tech companies end up with Silicon Valley as an important hub for
their actions. The Tech giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google, UBER,
Lyft, Nvidia, Intel, Instagram, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Twitter, Netflix,
Y-combinator, Tesla, Airbnb, PayPal, SpaceX, Stripe, Snap, Udacity are
all in the Silicon Valley with their headquarters. Somehow Amazon,
Microsoft are not mainly in Silicon valley. They do have a small
presence there. For example, Microsoft has only 2000 employees out of
its 145k employees in California. But for the rest the best of the
best are having their hub in Silicon Valley.

**Finance**

When I talk to friends in the field of finance wanting to make big
bucks, the only place they can think of and pursue is NYC and in
Investment Banking. 

**Entertainment**

It is known that people move to these regions. Its a fact.

**EA**

In [this](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpQqh6wCDtfZkeneg/should-you-visit-an-ea-hub) article 14 people have been to an EA hub (SF and Oxford)
and out of which 9 of them are in the EA hubs (Oxford, London, SF bay
area).

Peter McIntyre who co-founded EA Australia, which has raised over
3M<span>$</span> for EA work, seems to have found his way as director
of Recruiting in 80khours Oxford.

Brenton Mayer who also co-founded EA Australia, is now in 80khours in
Berekeley as Co-head of Coaching. 

[Tara MacAulay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/), managed to introduce her system in the hospital she was
working at saving over [a million dollars a year](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/tara/). She moved to
Oxford and later to CEA as part of her work as a chief in the Centre
for Effective Altruism.

There are another 6 people who have similar stories probably but are
in positions at the "top" EAOs (as declared by 80khours, such as
Centre for Effective Altruism). 

So atleast there is some evidence that these are seeming ambitious
people moving to the hubs.


## Ambition is contagious provided dot dot dot
## Persuasion: It matters what message a city sends

Persuasion is when you let go of your current values to absorb the
values of other people without you even noticing it.

<!-- **New Year's King's Day, trying to succeed socially** -->

I never did anything before 2015 for New Year's (age of 24). At max I
would play at a hotel for some money or food. And just once I really
went out for the new year. Mostly I spent it at home sleeping and it
was totally ok, when I was in India. I didn't feel pressured and
didn't feel bad at all.

Somehow from then until 2015 something seems to have changed. In 2014
August, I moved to Netherlands and when December started coming, I
started panicking. All the people were leaving to their home towns and
a lot of people were making plans for New Year's Eve. I had
none. People in my dorm left to their home towns. So it either meant
staying in my dorm room or going to the City Center alone. But both
seem to spell out disaster. I mean, I was going to look hopeless when
people ask me what I did for New Year's. So I spent 600â‚¬ (approx.)
despite my dad saying NO (it was his money), and managed to go to UK
to my cousins house from 18th December. I was hoping to study there,
but I couldn't, so I came back on 22nd December. But hey, atleast I
would have a story to tell people.

I remember this conversation after university started again in January
with three friends (this is 2014 and now we are in 2020 and yet I
remember even now who all were there vividly). They popped the
question during break. "So Agent18, what did you do for the New
Year". I somehow managed with this UK travel and they didn't dig
deep. Phew! A sense of relief passed by. It seems like it was all
building up for this one moment. Another friend talked about how he
hitch hiked and smoked pot in the car with his girlfriend. It was a
mad story. I was so envious. Why was I not like that.

It was not just that New Year, but all New Year's that have happened
hence forth. One new year I purposely came to Netherlands on the 31st,
just so that when people asked me what I did for New Years, I could
tell them I just came home and was tired. This 2020, when my colleague
said he is back on 2nd, the first thing that ran in my mind is fuck I
have to deal with "what did you do for the New Year's?" question.

In India most of them (colleagues from IIT or most friends that I
had), seemed to not care about it. But here the topic is around, there
is a buzz in the common kitchen. And the dreaded question, "What did
you do for New Year's?" is right around the corner. That seems to be
the main difference and that I somehow succumb to it. Whether you like
it or not there seems to be pressure anyway. Somehow I care about what
those question posers think about me. Agent18 is not cool. or Somehow
I think I should go out on New Year's and have a story to tell.

I don't think this was an isolated incident. I took quite some effort
to celebrate something called King's Day. Everyone was doing something
for it. My dorm members, the Tamil gang I knew, my university
colleagues, everybody was doing it. It appeared ludicrous to not do
anything for it. I wore orange just like everyone, worked hard on
finding a group and trotted around different cities. Success. Contrast
that to what I did for Chinese New Year (another celebration I didn't
know much about). NOTHING. WHY? It was not as popular I guess, not
many people seemed to be concerned with it around me. My dorm members
didn't talk about celebrating it, nor did the Tamil gang I knew, nor
did the University colleagues. No one asked me, "Bro how was your
Chinese New Year?".

**If staying closer causes persuation, staying away might cause
non-persuasion** **Persuasion reduces with strength of the memory**

This time when I went to India, a lot of people I met were talking
about CAA, politics. Just this particular day, my friend and I are
together for the whole day meeting different people. We meet another
friend and they began talking with one another about politics,
laughing and making jokes about someone and I didn't get any of it. I
was discouraged to ask questions as I didn't get any response. I had
nothing to contribute and felt like I didn't belong and would belong
better if I brushed up my politics. We hopped to another setting with
another crowd and there again the same topic erupted. By the end of
the night I was asking him how I can stay abreast all these topics,
what sources I should use etc...

However now, after a month, I am the exact same guy who never really
cared about keeping abreast the situations in India. 

I think the way I see forward is to make a choice on what persuasions
to allow. I am in no place I think, to have girlfriends. I should be
working on important things and them only. I conciously stay away from
love songs, movies about love, sitcoms about love. I have friends who
are studs with girls. I am friends with them unfortunately, but focus
on staying away from any discussions that might relate to who all he
slept with. My MO is banter, useless banter such as talking about
tamil serials and how stupid it is etc... I think this is working as I
remember the last time we talked about girls how I felt and this time
when I talked to him how I felt. I didn't feel like shit anymore. :)

Things related to practicing hard, triumphant moments of great people,
people doing good for people, and sitcoms such as Seinfeld and Modern
Family, are all things that I happily welcome into my life. I welcome
listening to the tamil songs where they talk shit about women and
about how relationship sucks. I don't mind being fed these values.

<!-- **Persuasion is very subtle. It sneaks up on you without you even -->
<!-- realizing it.** -->

Persuasion is very subtle in its form. It sneaks up on you in places
you never expect. I was watching Youtube bites of "Hey Steve". I find
the hosts reaction extremely funny. So, I was bingeing these 2 min
videos one after the other. The format is that the audience, filled
with a lot of beautiful women, would ask the host help on their
relationships. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NunpJODvNA) video of this women discussing about how her
husband should dress more sexily like the host was the last video I
watched. The audience were going crazy applauding. The host was giving
funny reactions etc... I decided it was time to go get some food, when
all of a sudden this thought hit me: "It would be nice to have a
girlfriend. I should start with dating some Indian chick". 

Huh? Where did that come from. It could be random. But what I don't
understand is that when last Saturday when I was on a roll working
more than 6 hours on the weekend inside my house, why I didn't think
about dating an Indian chick. It didn't help me stay away despite this
being an old couple (60-70 year olds).

**Instances where it doens't persuade you**

people getting married around me

**Visiting an EA hub persuasion**



**Finale**

Separate yourself from people who talk about stuff other than your
desired goals. Because whether we like it or not we end up being
persuaded. 


I think with this part I want to convey two things!

- First thing is that great cities attract ambitious people and that
  in the end you will be fed with their persuasion.
  
- Secondly, potentially the first point is that we easily get
  persuaded, when we are around people. Our values change
  
- They last as long as the memory of when people are around is frequent
