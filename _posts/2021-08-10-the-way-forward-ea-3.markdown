## Entry Question

What should I do now? Careerwise.

## Introduction

[Last year, I made lifetime impact estimates](/career-update.html) for a career in Data
Science and also a career as a GiveWell Researcher. The effective
value estimates seem to suggest to bet on becoming a GiveWell
Researcher.

{:.tablestyletwo}
| Effective value | low  | Best Guess | high  |
|-----------------|------|------------|-------|
| DS Masters      | 713k | 741k       | 865k  |
| DS L1           | 642k | 662k       | 875k  |
| GW Researcher   | 914k | 1.43m      | 1.95k |

However, an STM seems to think I should pursue Data Science like a
madman and give up the plans of becoming a GiveWell-type
Researcher. His two main points are that, what I have are estimates
(meaning that they are not "concrete dollar figures"). And secondly,
gaining "EA skills" is far less tangible than "Data Science
skills"[^2].

With this post I hope to explore these views and answer for myself
what I should be doing in the coming months.

## Estimates Inherently With A Lot Of Guesses

The effective value calculations shown above seem to suggest to bet on
the GiveWell research path. But hello! What are the error margins? 

The estimates computed for the "lifetime impact of a researcher" are
essentially [fermi-type estimates](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PsEppdvgRisz5xAHG/fermi-estimates), which are based on a lot of
guesses. For example, the counterfactual contribution of GiveWell is
estimated to be 37%. This is obtained by assuming that a GiveWell-like
organization would have formed anyway, after 7 years. If this number
is 2 years instead of 7, then the estimate becomes 14%. If it is 10
years then the estimate becomes more. Changing the counterfactual
contribution of GiveWell alone to 14% (from 37%), brings the total
impact down to 800k from 1.4m.

The whole thing being based on a hypothetical scenario, makes it
impossible to know what the real value would ever be. It is impossible
to test this. And the sad part is that there are many such factors
(e.g., counterfactual impact of a researcher, growth rate attributed
to researcher etc.).

Typical fermi-estimates are often expected to be [within a factor of
10](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PsEppdvgRisz5xAHG/fermi-estimates). And in this case (lifetime impact of a researcher), I feel no
more confident than saying the estimate could be off by a
factor 10. This means a variation in the estimate could be between
143k to 14m`$`. I don't even know on which side of the error band the
impact could be in.

Things get even more blurry if it is not a GiveWell Research
position--where the money moved is typically known. If it is something
like Rethink Priorities--which mainly produces research--then you
don't have a clear dollar figure on how much money they
influence. This means more guesses which you can't verify or test.

However, I feel much more confident in the "estimates" on lifetime
impact of a Data Science career. For one, they are not pulled out of
thin air, they are actually based on historic data. For example, the
probability of getting H1B within OPT years is estimated to be
58%. This is based on historic data on the number of people who make
it through the lottery in one year (41.9%) and the number of people
who make it out of an RFE (60.4%) [^1].

In cases where such historic data is not available, anecdotal data is
used to make a guess. For example, to estimate the probability of
finishing master's and getting a job in the US (in a "non-recession
year"), I think of all my friends who are currently in the US and
stories of people who had to come back as a result of not getting a
job. Except for one guy who didn't manage a proper job, all of the
others (some 20 people) seem to have completed their masters and
gotten a job in the US (even the supposedly "dumb" ones). Thus, I
consider this probability of finishing Masters and getting a job in
the US to be 70-80%.

The best part with choosing such a career is that I WILL KNOW what my
contribution is going to be at the end of each year in Data Science,
based on the donations. As a result it is way more tractable.

To sum up, I feel way more confident about the Data Science estimates
than the estimates for a GiveWell Researcher position. I would like to
however see other arguments in favor of one or the other.

<!-- time. I didn't get what he was saying. When 80000hours said that -->
<!-- "personal fit" was the most important thing... Peter also seemed to -->
<!-- suggest a route based on personal fit, but I never got it. -->

## Upskilling to get a foot in the door

I recently wrote about [EA skills](/ea-skills-2.html) needed based on a discussion
with a couple of "EA people". Skills listed include things like
"ability to read academic papers", "ability to write independent
research", "writing good conversation notes", "quickly evaluating
interventions" etc. In addition, looking at [job postings](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707192525/https://founders-pledge.jobs.personio.de/job/386446) show
certain other skills like "cause area prioritization", "gaining good
calibration" and "funding opportunity investigation" etc.

Assuming I know what sort of skills are needed in the EA world, it
appears to be hard to design a deliberate practice routine in some
cases.

Some skills such as "reading academic papers", I have hopes of
practicing with a lot of feedback. For example, I can look at the
papers cited in GiveWell, pass my own comments about the papers and
then see what GiveWell had to say, compare and improve. There are a
lot of intervention reports, so there is no dearth of material. I have
elaborated on this routine [here](/ea-skills-2.html).

Similarly, for writing independent research (following on the
Deliberate Practice case study [here](http://pradeep90.github.io/ben-franklin-practice.html))--such as done by Saulius
[here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gGiiktK69R2YY7FfG/fish-used-as-live-bait-by-recreational-fishermen)--I have the hope of learning, by looking at blog posts and
intervention reports, checking them against dimensions (specified in
[good reasoning transparency](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/reasoning-transparency), "[how we evaluate a study](https://blog.givewell.org/2012/08/23/how-we-evaluate-a-study/)", and
some notes byÂ [Micheal Arid](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/J7PsetipHFoj2Mv7R/notes-on-ea-related-research-writing-testing-fit-learning)), and imitating them ([#Ben-Franklin
DP Method](http://pradeep90.github.io/ben-franklin-practice.html)).

However, when I think of "cause area prioritization", "funding
opportunity investigation" or "gaining good calibration", I am unsure
how to proceed, other than by reading some documents from say Global
Priorities Institute and "try to emulate" "their style". This is very
vague and I have low confidence of developing in it without feedback
from an actual person.

I also think skills such as "conversation notes writing, based on
audio", "quickly evaluating interventions" or for that matter learning
about "causal inference", are going to be hard to upskill in, due to
the lack of practice material (or feedback).

Contrast this to Data Science skills: Machine Learning, SQL, Python
etc., which have tons of tutorials and courses to learn from, to the
point of even getting a job in it. With a week of learning and
completely using online resources, I recently got an internship offer,
and from another company a "positive-ish response"[^6] based on
assignments on web scraping and unsupervised classification
respectively.

And even things like "exploratory data analyses" *perhaps* can be
learned from the many problems in Kaggle and looking at the
discussions. Not too straight forward but seems possible for
practicing.

And in the worst case, I could do a masters or a post masters as
suggested by several hiring managers from my company. Not sure what
the stats on that are (I can find out) but they said they would "be
interested" in me after that.

(Granted I wanted to port to a Data Science job, but now am "only an
analyst" after like a year and that too only within my company. I
really suspect it's the "lack of experience" and the "lack of a
degree", as that is the feedback I seem to be getting from those
willing to offer it. I am really not sure it is my "skill building in
Data Science" which was the issue here. To become "great" however is a
whole different story all-together.)

With EA I am really unsure what skills to focus on NOW. I recently got
the feedback after an interview that I needed to think in a Bayesian
way and focus on cost-effectiveness analysis, another feedback was
that I needed to do independent research and practice forecasting and
get credentials in it. And when I talk to other GiveWell-type
researchers the feedback was to learn to read academic papers and
write independent research. These seem like very different things
needing a "lot of my time". And to add to the confusion, I don't
really know how long or when the training is good enough, other than
through applying or writing EA forum posts where people might weigh in
on my level.

With Data Science also this part might be hard. People don't seem to
always be able to articulate what to work on and to what level to work
on to get to a job. But my usual rule of thumb is to work on one
example problem for a particular skills (i.e., one Kaggle problem) and
seeing it through. This seems to be working "pretty well" (not with
getting an interview but with doing "well"[^6] in interviews and case
studies at least).

As a result, I am more confident about learning Data Science skills
(and perhaps "mastering" them one day).

## Earning to Give in the US

Going to the US is a crucial part of Earning-To-Give. Earning for the
rest of my life in the Netherlands will probably get me to
[300k-400k](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=1568212165&range=C38) donations over my lifetime, while even if I make it to
the US in another 20 years and manage a 500k salary with a 250k
donation for just 3 years, I would make twice more than what I could
do in the Netherlands over a lifetime. Thus it appears to be very
important that I make it to the US, now or even eventually.

In order to maximize my chances I think I would need to start with a
master's and in case that tanks, I can always come back to Netherlands
(or perhaps go to Canada[^3]) and continue to keep trying via an
L1[^8] or pursue other ways to go to the US[^4]. One thing very
important in this whole process is to "practice Data Science skills"
and try to become "great" (more on what to work on and how to work on
it later).

It could so happen that a master's would involve a lot of debt. If I
am in the US and have a job for 1-2 years I can perhaps reduce the
debt "significantly". If I fail completely and don't end up getting a
job in the US even for 1-2 years, then I will have a large debt (say
100k`$`). But the chances of that happening are low I think (20%ish)
as most of the people I know have managed some job in the US after
their masters. H1B might be an issue, but getting a job so far doesn't
seem to be. 

## EA is not going to be missing me

The EA sphere is super competitive. Below are the acceptance rates at
several programs:

| Year | Org | position                            | AR    |
| ---  | --- | ---                                 | ---   |
| 2018 | OPP | GR                                  | <5%   |
| 2018 | EAF | GR & Operations                     | 3%    |
| 2019 | CE  | CE entrepreneurship program         | 11.7% |
| 2020 | CE  | CE Entrepreneurship program         | <1%   |
| 2019 | CE  | Internship Mental Health            | <2.5% |
| 2019 | FWI | Research analyst Welfare specialist | 2.4%  |

As a result of the competitiveness they are going to continue "just as
usual" with or without me. No one is going to be "missing me". And
perhaps I can leave the research to other people who are already good
at it, and perhaps people who don't have the possibility to
Earn-To-Give in tech in US.

## Possibility of getting back to the EA

Perhaps in the off chance that EA somehow looks like a lucrative
option for me in the future (depending on how EA progresses) maybe I
can offer my skills as a Data Scientist. Currently there seem to be
some companies using Data Analytics [^5] in the EA community.

And in the worst case, I can always produce independent research, to
"add more value", while Earning-To-Give.

## Value Drift 

I always panic thinking about the future and how it's going to be. I
feel afraid that as a result of not being in the EA-sphere (i.e.,
talking EA 24x7 as would be in an EA job) I am going to loose all my
motivation to grind every single day. I think of grinding day-in and
day-out for the next 10 years and get worried. And to that person (me)
I say, test what you can measure, and test something you can measure
now.

Over the last 4 years, I can easily claim I would have been doing at
least 2 hrs a day of work (growing by every year). Over the last 5
weeks I have been averaging 25 hrs a week of work. I am even doing 5
hrs on a weekday per week. And during all these years when I have been
grinding, all I had was an STM mainly and the rest of the motivation
was all through self or through meetups or forum posts etc. Now I
don't know about the future and I could be very wrong, but if the past
is any indication of the future, I think it is going to be fine.

I am probably going to learn more statistics, more about rationality.
I am going to be writing more and developing in these things with
time. I am going to have a much better understanding of
motivation. With all these powerful tools, I predict the future is
going to be just fine with regard to value drift and feeling motivated
to grind for EA "day-in and day-out".

Perhaps if my concern is value drift or not feeling motivated enough,
often I find that listening to a podcast or seeing other great people
brings the [persuasion](http://pradeep90.github.io/how-to-get-persuaded.html) back. Perhaps attending zoom events
regularly might still be an option.

Once I am in California it should be much easier I guess to feel
persuaded to be "great" in Data Science.

Persuasion is a bitch but I think we gots it whence we get our
persuasion from other Data Science people and EA people, and avoid
persuasion by staying away for the most part from "other people".
