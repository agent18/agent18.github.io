## Introduction

So I am evaluating my career options and wanted to understand what it
meant to work in Dubai, earn in Dubai etc... For this I spoke to my
classmate in bachelor's who is in Dubai for the last 6 years. I also
spoke to my cousin who is in Dubai for 13 years (initially a
mechanical engineer who moved into sales). And lastly I spoke to
another cousin of mine who is there in Dubai for 16 years in Insurance.

### What I am looking for

- Career Capital needed
- Earning potential
- Lifetime earnings
- personal fit (job security etc...)
- exit opportunities

## Entry opportunities

 Dubai market is mainly based on projects. Dubai is trying to be a
 trading hub. They want to have a large influx of people into and out
 of Dubai continuously! There is no R&D, there is no
 manufacturing. Things like sales, marketing, management, banking,
 finance, seem to be relevant here. Sectors like Automotive,
 construction, marine, aviation, banking, insurance, can be targeted
 here.
 
 Some examples of entry opportunities I have heard of:
 
 - 'site-engineer' for construction, infrastructure, marine projects.
	 
 Start with the lowest salary of 48k AED and slowly jump to
 different and more meaningful roles over time with good salary
 jumps. Within 6 years my classmate jumped to a salary of 300k AED. An
 average jump of 35% each year.

- Heat load mechanical engineer or similar to sales

 My cousin who went to Dubai as a mechanical engineer, moved into the
 sales space and is now general manager of a group. This guy probably
 earns ~650k AED over 13 years of being in dubai, having started at a
 salary of 48k AED. This implies an average jump of 22% over 13 years.
 
- Insurance
 
 Another cousin of mine made it into insurance after a mere Master in
 commerce and a lot of hardwork. He is in Dubai for ~18 years. He also
 started out with 48k AED and moved on to 750k in the span of 18
 years. This is about 16% increase on average for 18 years.
  
- Banking
 
 Another cousin who had been in Dubai for 10 years was earning
 450k. He managed himself into this field with an electronics
 background. Roughly 25% jump every year for 10 years.
 
- MBA --> consulting or management type of roles
 
 It seems to look like a better idea to gain some experience and
 then come to Dubai to find suitable roles. In the worst case you
 can go back to the country where you came from in case Dubai
 decides to fuck you up. 
 
 Based on discussions with people in Dubai, I have come to an estimate
 of 400-450k AED if I move to Dubai after an MBA, assuming I killed it
 in my MBA and the job I take up after that.

- Design Engineering

	Highly unlikely to be in any sort of technical level work. Haven't
    seen any evidence that suggests that engineers at all are
    important and that they can earn as reasonably as people in
    management.
	
For me it appears that I should pursue the MBA track, gain some
experience and then come here. I don't want to put my precious years
gambling and surviving in Dubai, rather I want to be earning FCC.
	
## Exit opportunities

I have not much idea about this. I have seen cases of people who are
fired and don't have jobs as a result. With an MBA and doing a lot of
hardwork, I suppose in the worst case I could make atleast half the
impact of a successful career in Dubai. It looks like I will be
obtaining my citizenship in holland in a few years, so my fall back
option would be to come back here and see how I can fare. 

## Impact

I think the best way right now is with an MBA and some consulting
experience. This means by the age of 35 I could be in Dubai in some
management position. A retirement age of 60-65 is considered here
unlike in other countries as I do not expect the current retirement
age to grow in Dubai, as their economy does not need people to work
long. This leaves us with the number of lives saved between 530 and
730 lives.


- working for another 25 years from 35
- starting at 400k AED (108k$)
- with growth of 10% per year until I am 55
- followed by a growth of 2% per year until I am 60
- using max. age for working as 60
- 25% donation (having already budgeted 15% for retirement)
- and 2% inflation on the price of a life


## Personal fit

All the chances of doing an MBA, apply here and in addition we have
the chance of losing job in dubai which I estimate at 20%, i.e., 80%
of keeping the job in Dubai.

- Clearing GMAT (70%)
- getting scholarship (60%)
- join Mckensey (50%)
- getting job in Dubai with 3+ years of consulting exp (75%)
- Not loosing said job until 60 (75%)

## Personal fit x Impact

We make a decision tree and compute the effective value of pursuing
such a career in Dubai.

| Crossroad                | Success | Other | # lives:Succes | # lives: failure | EI: Success | EI: failure |
|                          |         |       |                |                  |             |             |
|--------------------------|---------|-------|----------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| GMAT                     | 70.0%   | 30.0% | NA             | 730              | 437         | 219         |
| Scholarship              | 60.0%   | 40.0% | NA             | 730              | 332         | 292         |
| McKinsey                 | 50.0%   | 50.0% | NA             | 65%x700          | 326         | 228         |
| getting job in dubai     | 75.0%   | 25.0% | NA             | 700              | 476         | 175         |
| not loosing job in dubai | 75.0%   | 25.0% | 730            | 350              | 548         | 88          |


This produces an effective value of 655.

## Appendix info: Earning potential

My friend started with 4k dirams (1k$) and moved to 8k dirams and then
to 24k dirams or more in 6 years. The jump looks to be quite
drastic. 

I have a couple of cousins in Dubai who are ~40 years of age. These
people I suspect will be getting from 750k to 1000k dirams
(~272k$). They all seem to be having luxurious lives, and can afford
to spend 25k$ on a family vacation. Something I find to be insane. 

Dubai seems like the money haven. People don't pay any taxes.  A US
salary of 272k$ is probably taxed at >30%. This means the taxed amount
might be /> 80k$. This 80k however goes straight into your pocket in
Dubai.

> cousin in sales is aged at 40 probably at 600k, he came 6 years
> later than me, Cousin in banking came later and earns about 450k. I
> earn in the range of 750k AED, and I am 43 and in a senior most
> position in insurance. And our senior most cousin in Dubai who had

"If you are bachelor you can save >50% as a bachelor"- Cousin!
 
Based on this I expect to save about 200k AED. This is about 54k
Euros per year. Based on my conversations, with people in dubai, I
estimate pure savings of 54k, 15% for retirement, 25% for
donation. 

I estimate a salary of 400k AED, when I start in Dubai. I should have
20-30 years to work after with 10% growth per year. I will be able to
save 50%, which means 200k is the cost. If 15% goes into savings,
another 10% for years I might not be able to work, it appears I can
donate about 20-25%. 

**Retirement age**

> 50 max for construction real estate, 60 for insurance and banking -
> friend 1

> 60 max - cousin in sales earning 500-600k AED

> 60 max - counsin in insurance
