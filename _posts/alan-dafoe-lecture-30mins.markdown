## Alan Dafoe lecture

War

Causes of War

Number of people they kill

Most common wars (syria civil war)

P(billion people dying)= small not 0

WWII 9m

WWI  

No data set... Power law distribution... Don't understand the graph!

No idea what the graph means: Total deaths in quarrels of that
magnitude

What we see is that, the max crazy number of deaths don't come about
as an addition of small deaths but as an addition of large deaths
(WWII)

From the power law we see that if we would like human extinction, then
we would need to kill billion people so that we get there. Atleast
thats what alan dafoe says...

What is the value of future?

Moral uncertainty...

only billion people billion years..... 10k trillion lives.

Thinking heuristics... 10^3 lives save P reduce it by


P()xLives = 10^16 x P()/10^13 = 10^3 lives

I guess the point is to show that even if the P reduces by 10^13 you
can save 1000 lives.


Risk of extinction is important (not clear.)
