## Remove git init

	rm -rf .git
	
## Folder to new repository in Github?

- Go to said folder & :

		git init

		git add .
		
		git commit -m "First commit"

[Source: Github](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)

- Create a new git repository, and don't add any files in it. No readme
nothing, just an empty repo.

		git remote add origin remote
		https://github.com/username/name-of-repository.git
		
		git push origin master

That's it... type in your credentials.

## .gitignore

Sometimes you might want to add a .gitignore file to ignore certain
folders or files:

Create the file in the main folder

	touch .gitignore
	
For ignoring files add `*.filetype`. For ignoring folders add
`/ignore-this-folder/` followed by `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
([Source](https://www.jamescoyle.net/how-to/1094-ignoring-files-in-git-with-gitignore), and [this](https://github.com/pradeep90/Emacs-Config/blob/master/.gitignore)). Check your github repo online to see if
the changes are reflected. Mostly not!

So do the following based of of this question: [gitignore not
working](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25436312/gitignore-not-working)

	git rm -rf --cached .
	git add .

## Creating a new branch

[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32391944/5986651)

	git checkout -b new_branch master
	
	git push origin new_branch
	
## Going back to older commit

[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-to-revert-a-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit)


	git revert --no-commit oldercommit..HEAD
	git commit -m "reverted to oldercommit"
	
## Accidentally uploading a large file commit

You get the dreaded git error from remote saying you tried to commit a
large file. In this particular case I had uploaded a file "core" which
is genenrated by linux in case of wierd crashes. No worries. this shit
can be removed peacefully.

I followed the instructions here as it was a recent commit and I had
not done anything after that: 

	git rm --cached core
	git commit --amend -C HEAD

	lazygit "comment"
	
and done. :)
