## Have an already existing repository?

[From Gihthub:](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)

	git init

	git add .
	
	git commit -m "First commit"

Create a new git repository, and don't add any files in it. No readme
nothing, just an empty repo.

	git remote add origin remote
    https://github.com/username/name-of-repository.git
	
	git push origin master



That's it... type in your credentials. 

## .gitignore

Sometimes you might want to add a .gitignore file to ignore certain
folders or files:

Create the file in the main folder

	touch .gitignore
	
For ignoring files add `*.filetype`. For ignoring folders add
`/ignore-this-folder/` followed by `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
([Source](https://www.jamescoyle.net/how-to/1094-ignoring-files-in-git-with-gitignore), and [this](https://github.com/pradeep90/Emacs-Config/blob/master/.gitignore)). Check your github repo online to see if
the changes are reflected. Mostly not!

So do the following based of of this question: [gitignore not
working](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25436312/gitignore-not-working)

	git rm -rf --cached .
	git add .
