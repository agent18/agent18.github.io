#### Problem

Recently been struggling with motivating myself to do things that are important to myself. Such as Cardio, Gym, writing creating impact, making money only to give, saving lives etc...

Despite Scooby saying in his website,
> if you have only 20minutes of time in a day for exercise. Do cardio. World Health Organization suggests it.

That is how important cardio is. And yet I find myself struggling to keep it up. This is the thrid week and it is quite hard for me to feel motivated while doing cardio.

It's outdated to say "be like batman, make the decisions no one can make". That's a great saying, but that's all that is, without motivation you are nothing I guess. Rather, with Motivation life is much better init!

I have been working out at the gym full time for 3-4 weeks now, 4-5 days a week atleast. And I am afraid the beginning where I do rotisserrie workout for 15 mins is boring. I want to go inside lift straight up. I don't want to do silly stuff, atleast not when I see I am loosing my ability to do more. I can go to the gym almost everyday, as long as I feel epic when I come out. I remember leg day, I finish with squats. Do you have any idea, how I feel when I sweat my fucking ass off pulling off the last sets! Thats not what I see on push day, pull day is the worst. Where is my motivation?

I told my friend I will write for 2 hrs every day and come up with 2.5k proper post at the end of the week. Oh god kill me, why did I even sign up for this. It's painful. No actual real goals, just writing for 2 big hours.

I know the pleasurable life is shit, wont last and very costly. I know that people are dying and that they need ~most~ all my attentio. Yet, I find myself watching vlogs of people showing how to be a cool "Choch". Woe es ist die motivation?

#### Delay

When do people file their taxes when the deadline?
As close as possible to the end.

When does every one in my company submit "induvidual Review forms" for a review of a document?
Half hour before. I have done 5 mins before even.

A few weeks back, when did an agent write most of the 2.5 k words?
Goal was to deliver an article of 2.5k by the end of friday starting on monday. I had done only the first 1.2k by friday 20:00 hrs. Let's just say it was a long night.

The time before the deadline (delay) seems to be inversely propotional to our motivation.

#### Challenging

Why don't people like doing laundry, cooking? I for one procrastinate the fuck before I find my ass on its way to do this shit?
I hate doing it. It's boring. It's work I don't enjoy.

Why don't I like to edit verification procedures at work?
I am beyond bored. It's not challenging. I listen to music on the side and still find it painful to do it all day.

Why don't people like to stretch for 10 mins before starting work out? Why don't people like to rortisserie workout before they begin the real deal?


Why do you like to solve hard problems at work?
It keeps me on my toes, great learning etc. I remember one day at work, when I was asked to replace a trouble shooter all of a sudden. I didn't want to eat. I was so engrossed in the trouble ticket of my life. I was on my toes. I caught a breather at 15:00 hrs. I told myself then. This is what I want to do bruv.


Why do people like lifting weights, just beyond what they can?

Why do people like playing chess with equal or higher ranked players?

Why do you like games?
The game design is such that it keeps your motivated, it keeps all 108 bits alive, and just pushes you out of your comfortzone, to an achievable goal.

Why didn't you like editing 1.5 k words?
Because I couldn't do it. In the beginning it was fun, but when the reality hit me I started taking it easy. What is the point of doing something when you can't win?

Apparently you have 108 bits to occupy and a task that uses all these bits is challenging enough; Trouble shooting. Something that doesn't need all 108 bits, is boring; folding your clothes perhaps! Something that needs more than 108 bits, still boring; planning to write 1.5k words when you can't. Something that just, pushes you out of your comfort-zone and achievable seems like a deadly combination.

The state of using all of your bits and continuing to do that over continuous periods is called as flow.

#### Feedback reward punishment

Why do you like knowing that you did better than last time?
Progress. Today for the first time I am pressing 28kg 8 solid reps, struggling, increase from last time. I tell to myself, "I love working out". I know that all the work I put in nutrition and elsewhere is paying. Positive feedback makes me wanna keep at it.

Why do you like hearing compliments from your Design Leader?
At work I solved a Trouble ticket after 2.5 days. In the End my DL said, " Good job, this is what I wanted". Any idea how I felt, after hearing from him over the last two days that I wasn't giving him what he wanted or that I had what it takes to work there.

Why do you like hearing compliments from your gym bros?
At the gym on people hearing I workout 5 days and do cardio everyday. Bitch it made my day.

Why do you like knowing that you can lift more than the last time?

Why can programmers keep programming forever. I have heard 10hrs programming continuously. But how?
Apparently the compile button gives you enough positive feedback, that you can keep going after it. It's not that hard to pull an all nighter on a programming assignment. I could pull it even today. Thats the feeling I have about writing code. I don't imagine it to be a pain, a chore. It's somehow fun. My friend (data-scientist) says casually while he was setting something up in python, I could do this all day. The feedback we get from it and us just being completely consumed in it, just works quite well.

Why can you play games forever?
Right amount of challenge + continous feedback on how you are performing. +1 this, +1 that, all sorts of noises when you kill someone, etc... I can't remember the countless hours of AOE I played in my life.

Why do you like talking to an STM?
I smile when he puts the peace sign. I suspect its the positive feedback, the good old "Good job agent", in a sign. He puts up the peace sign, when I got something right.

Why do I like going to the subway near my house in chennai?
Of course it is the food, but it could also be that I liked talking to the guy there, he probably made me feel special and cool. We always laughed. Why I say 'probably' is because, I didn't realize I had told this to an STM 3 years back. The very fact that I had mentioned a guy in subway to him, raises questions as to if I went there only for the food.

I suspect its the same thing with msgs. I was recently ignored by a friend for a comment. My friend scaled a mountain for beginners and all I said was a stupid comment about the pose he made in the picture. Where as my other friends said. Amazing and stuff like that. I suspect the response I got was pretty much because I was such a negative whore. I thought I was begin funnny, but my boy probably just wanted some feedback.

Why did I like eating at subway?
I liked talking to the guy apparently. Apparently I told an STM about the guy. He told me k=now and I was shocked.

Why do I sometimes not like to eat at VATAN?
I buy for exactly 2 euros. The guy hates me because of that, and treats me like shit. Negative feedback, lack of motivation?

Everytime I write an Essay, I long for an STMs feedback. I long for him to say. 'Great job'. When I have really done some work, it would be nice to hear it. Remember the time when he wrote that email where he said, "One small step for an Agent, one giant leap for mankind". Positive feedback bitch. The number of times I had read that email. The feeling it gave me. The motivation. What would an stm say about my article? is something I think about for sure.

#### Using your brain at full capacuity

Why humans have boredom?
To make sure they should always be working at full capacity. You need to work at full capacity always use all your ram, so that you can make the best of the situation, you dont know what will happen when, you need to be aware of the surrounding. On a dark alleyway, youare at your full capacity because only then can you save yourself.

#### Where do you feel Motivation
A few weeks back I did work as a trouble shooting engineer. I remember telling myself, wow. I didn't get a minute of break. I was working in peak form getting shit done, because delays would cost us money. At 15 hrs is when I was able to take a break to eat. I just didn't want to eat. I wanted to finish the work. I didn't feel uncomfortable, I was just running possibly at full capacity.

I go to the gym 5 times a week. I suspect I am going there primarily to get a great body. But, for example, today, I am thinking about my baby squats and how motherfucking awesome its going to be to kill at those sets. I am clinging to the feeling I had last time or some time I guess. The day when I did squats, when I was pushing myself to do the last rep and I was sweating AF from just moving slowly. Thats when I knew (feedback) that motherfucker did some work today. Motherfucker tore some muscles. Oh boy am I excited about leg day tomorrow.

Many days I am excited abotu work. Solving problems I suspect is the one that drives me. And as you solve problems, the day keeps getting better? I suspect. I feel bored at work, but thats when I have to update some lame as procedure, do some crazy ass manual work (I do it only while listening to music). When I am on my toes, sufficiently solving a problem that I just can work on, something challenging. And ofcourse a  now and then, good job from my DL. This is what keeps me going at work. The time when I was doing design, time would fly, with so much things to do.

Basket ball. I used love playing that sport. Everyweek I used to play with who ever was available. I love playing, I love playing and most importantly I need to score for my team, do some incredible passes, some great plays some blocks. These are the things that would make me want to play more. If I sucked in a week, I have had the motivation to practice through the week to imporove.

#### Some examples where motivation actually happens

#### The equatoin of motivation

  $ Mathivanan=Capacity*feedback/delay of reward

The rudimentary equation of motivation seems to be the above. The question is how to we make our lives geratly motivated to the task that we need absed on this shit.

Cardio
During cardio I don't know about the capacity of my work, basically, I need to push to a huge point. The  problem is I don't know how far I am supposed ot push. Pushing too much in the beginning causes exaustion. Overall cardio is seeming to become hard cause I don't have the tools to let me know how I a doing.  I am not sure what I can do with capacity. But I suspect I can do with feedback. I have been thinking the solution to my motivation problem being buyin g a new cycle, which I can change gear and ride fast, probably see more scenray. But If you look closely, it has never been clearer to me, my oh my, its feedback. I don't know what spped I am supposed to do with my bike. So I am thinking speedometer. I am thinking one that shows me speed. This way, I can make estimates of what speed I should try to average. This is my goal. Despite wind(control activity by going both directions), I think it is easy to keep getting constant feedback from the instrument so that  I can know how much more I need to travel. I still have my doubts about how to make the whole thing solid and what happens when I max out?. It is one of my biggest worries. That how will I motivate myself further. I guess there are several people in the world doing this, they somehow get the motivation. I am pretty convinced that the speedo meter should terll me what I am doing and then from there I know what is my average. and I will work with it from there. Cheers!

---

Of course I can measure the distance and the time. This will tell me how I did today. What to expect tomorrow? How to keep it slightly out of the comfort zone?

#### How is a bike going to change motivation
A new bike can make me go faster. I have been thinking that I can switch gears and go faster and work the gears so that they are in sync with the actual music. Until now this is teh technique I have tried. It keeps me going, but without feedback you are nothing. Remember an STM cycling for more than 1 hr

The motivation that it will do great things to your health is fine, but not one that is the greatest motivators. And I dont even measure my hearrate. Measuring heartrate at the end is quite bull shit! becuase you want to consistantly know you have atleast met that criterion.

#### How is a speedometer going to change
Right now, I don't have feedback until the end. If I had some meter informing about my heartrate or speed of travel I would get feedback then and there. Of course that is not enough, I need to know what average i need to maintain, and go by it. See if I am sticking to it everyday. Also as soon as I am done I get the distance. I have the time on my phone. Oh fuck.... I can see distance/ 5 mins, 10 mins, 20 mins and 30 mins. I understand holland has some winds and some slopes. I usually try to take the routes which do not stop me and routes that take me in and against the direction. I suspect it doesn't change it much. I want the feeling of finishing.

I suspect this is it. But why didn't your phone work? I guess it is becuase, I dont trust the reading. I forget to switch on the gps and it gives me a reading from where I switched on. Start and end of track are not clear. The fact that the phone automatically logs the data sounds suspicious, especially not knowing the duration the cycling and it also takes into account extra cycling that I do to get home.

I suspect all cyclists have it. Some sort of meter to gauge their performance. Does it all  make sense?

Hence I think this could help me get somewhere.


Now I can summarize the issues, the feedback I want to use the feedback that I lack! Adn what I propose. With my limited skill of problem solving, I suspect a better cycle can do nothing.

The way I dont have feedback and the way I don't have ffedback in the end now etc... I suspect makes jack a dull boy

So it becomes a chore I guess and more like de-motivation due to "lack of results". Great. Fit the speedoeter and lest come back to this part of the essay then.

Let the record hold it that its been two weeks of 5 days of cycling after gym. Yesterday monday, I felt quite bored. I keep trying to take the same route and complete it in teh same time or less. but its been hard knowing what to do and how fast to do things . For example, sometimes I take it on myself to just overtake normal players!

Last but not the least... complitments

#### Working out motivation
What motivates you to work out?

Feedback:

Lifting itself, when you do just push yourself while lifting, when you feel exhausted or feel awesome after a set.

That I am able to do more reps than last time, more weight than last time really feels amazing. When I sweat on a set. I don't really sweat when working out. Sometimes, I sweat. I see that as a sign of having done well.

Sore body after a day.

No pain of the back. Ability to enjoy all excercises. Right now, when it comes to back excercises, I really play it quite safe and slow.

delay:

Having a killer body takes time, so I am not explicitly counting on that, but implicitly I guess I am waiting for that to happen.

challenging:
To do more than I can


What motivates you to eat healthy?

The only reason, is to get maximum gains possible. Its not that hard to eat healthy (Carbs, protein and fat). I don't care that I go a little overboard on fat, but I can't control all as it is costly now.

And I better see it in the gains.

What de-motivates you?
The notes of the reps and weights is not proper, its too tightly spaced and am lacking the motivation to write there regularly.

Back pain

Decrease in reps from last time.  I see a clear decrease in power when it comes to rotisserie workout. I am struggling to do 45 secs, which I did with not too much discomfort last week. Plus I have been doing it for a while now, and see no improvemnet. Or I am pushing myself beyond what I can.


Fear of needing someone

Fear of breaking back again!

Lack of proper form.
What are the changes you are going to make in order to reduce the de-motivation

Ordered fat measuring device, started making notes of all the data, make better notes new sheets this weekend.

#### Writing

How do I continue to write. I remember days when I am so bored to write. 2 hrs how do I get done with that shit. The problem is it is not challenging. More challenging by making it like words per hour.

Writing gen words is not challenging or boring.

Friday is quite a pain. I struggle and procrastinate like hell. I want to finish the essay, but I take till early morning to write. I don't feel motivated enough to write as compared to watching youtube, even on the last day.

Problems

1) gigantic task ahead. Reducing 4k words to 2.5k but with several rewritings.

This is gonna take a while. #delay

More than 2 hrs of work on a friday, when I am tired and have no idea when this is going to finish.

How about including thursday in the process of cleaning up and rewriting. Ok. But I still suspect to have lot of delay, mainly because I don't know how lng it will take. I think it will take 3 to 4 hrs to reduce the stuff and make it comprehensible jibber jabber. I suggest we try it this week.

That way we know it takes so much time only.

2) not challenging to read through the whole thing and get it sorted, in no time what so ever.
boring and painful.

To make it challenging, I seriously should come up with parts, say 1.5 k each and edit it in one hr.

What about having to deal with rearranging. Not a problem. The goal is to edit the next 1k words, We can rearrange it and do what ever we want. We can try a free half an hour where I can do

It appears that I need to rewrite, and then re-arrange and then re-edit. every 1.5k 1 hr for re-writing and once that is done, re-arrange and re-edit after that can take its time, this week.


3) Reward or feedback comes the next day morning when I treat the fuck out of me with maggi and bhelpuri etc. but none other than closure the very same day.

How about a treat?

suprising insights!

How to write more,

#### How to feel motivated to donate more.

Reward is high, ok.
artificial reward of a chocolote or something that you like.

But there is crazy delay and feelings are almost null when you give.

Challenging! well, yes it is hard thing to come up with ideas to make money to begin with. This then translates to donating.

I dont know what to make of the three points in this case.

I guess I can offere myself a nice treat, every time I donte to tell the body what is important.

#### The puzzle of motivation
Solving a simple problem fast by giving rewards works better than solving a simple problem without rewards. Solving a hard problem with rewards does not work better than solving a hard  problem without rewards

The idea of having flow while working on problems is not a new one. Its about keeping yourself on your toes, It quite challenging, by that I guess we only mean that we use all the 108 bits of your info.


#### how to stay motivated regarding saving lives
When literally everything arround you and everyone around you doens't give 2 shits!


Write points as fast as I can.... Just generate content. and then work on editing all with similar goals of 100 words an hour. Any surpirise I enjoyed today?
