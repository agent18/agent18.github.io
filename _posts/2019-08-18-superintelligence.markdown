## Mission #9. 

**Mail dated Aug 13,**

Great job on spending 29 hours in a week! *I recommend measuring rate
of phrases per hour.*

Overall, I didn't see you take on Superintelligence, which was the
mission. Please work on either that or stuff you feel *confused*
about. *Only failures matter* (apart from maintenance of existing
performance).

Note down patterns of failure, such as "X prefers A to B". Spend, say,
half your time searching for and practicing on examples of those
types. You can spend the rest of your practice time on new examples,
from which you will hopefully find other patterns of failure.

**Mail dated June 24,**

Mission #9: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
concretely analyze the key claims in the book Superintelligence by
Nick Bostrom (the book mentioned in the Elon Musk tweet above). He's a
PhD at Oxford who's been writing about AI safety along with guys like
Eliezer for nearly two decades. The book has detailed arguments and
examples about all the topics like possible paths to
"superintelligence" (whatever that means), types of
"superintelligence", the control problem, etc.

No need to write "Question: " - doesn't seem to have changed your
answers.

Don't have to go sentence by sentence; *look at one key claim for each
section, usually the one in the first few paragraphs*, or one for each
paragraph if you feel it's an important section. For example:

> CHAPTER 2 Paths to superintelligence
>
> Machines are currently far inferior to humans in general
> intelligence. Yet one day (we have suggested) they will be
> superintelligent. How do we get from here to there? This chapter
> explores several conceivable technological paths. We look at
> artificial intelligence, whole brain emulation, biological
> cognition, and human-machine interfaces, as well as networks and
> organizations. We evaluate their different degrees of plausibility
> as pathways to superintelligence. The existence of multiple paths
> increases the probability that the destination can be reached via at
> least one of them.

The key claim is "How do we get from here to there? Answer: Artificial
intelligence, whole brain emulation, ..."

Feedback checklist:

1. Could it be that this claim has no any example at all? For example,
   "civilization is at stake".

2. Could this claim be false? Remember the "there is no doubting"
   example.

3. Does this claim say anything about "best" (need to compare against
   the entire set) or "most" (need to show it's the majority in the
   set) or "no" (need to show that nothing in the set matches)?

4. Did you stick to examples that are in the chapter itself? That way
   you don't have to search online for too long.

5. Did you use a running example for a technical phrase? There will be
   lots of new phrases in the book, like "convergent instrumental
   value" and "orthogonality thesis". Whenever you see them, you
   should recall whatever running example you've used.

6. If this is an "if-then" claim, did you either get a concrete
   example or mark it as having no example?

Short names: none; false; best; chapter; running; if-then.

Please refer to the checklist after every claim analysis to ensure
you're not making old mistakes. If you want to add to the checklist
based on mistakes found in past feedback, that's great.

## Introduction

With this Essay I take on the first three chapters of
"Superintelligence" by Nick Bostrom, and the first three chapters of
Statistical Sleuth. I try to pick "important" claims from each section
and try to work them out in the typical DP fashion as is being done
since the last essay on "subject-predicate".

## Feedback list used in this essay

For this blog post, I use the checklist that looks like the following:

**Checklist**: yes; neither;;
*no-example*; *failed*; (*no idea how the example would look*);
**Pattern**: "random-sampling?"

In this checklist, "yes" refers to if the claim has an
example. "Neither" informs that I don't know if the claim is true or
false based on the example given. The claim has "*no-example*", and
I have "*failed*" in it, as I have "*no idea how the example would
look*". The pattern I suspect that I need to practice more, are claims
related to "random sampling", but I am unsure (?).

I have skipped things like "in-chapter" and "running" as part of my
checklists, as I think for most part I have tried to use "running" and
"in-chapter" examples. For example, in every chapter of Statistical
Sleuth there are two case studies at the beginning of the chapter. I
try to use these as much as possible as examples for claims. Where
they don't work, either I have not given examples or I have given other
examples in the book, or my own examples.

Regarding "if", "most/best" etc... I have identified it as a *pattern* when I
have failed in it.

## Chapter 1 History 
### Growth modes and big history 

> (History at the largest scale)[1], seems to exhibit (a sequence of
> distinct growth modes)[2], each much more rapid than (its predecessor)[3].

**Claims**: [1] seems to exhibit [2], each much more rapid than [3].

**Subject**: [2] exhibited in [1].

**Predicate**: much more rapid than [3]. 

**Example**: "A few hundred thousand years ago, in early human (or
hominid) prehistory, growth was so slow that it took in the order of
one million years for human productive capacity to increase
sufficiently to sustain an additional one million individuals living
at subsistence level. By 5000 BC, following the Agricultural
Revolution, the rate of growth had increased to the point where the
same amount of growth took just two centuries. Today, following the
Industrial Revolution, the world economy grows on average by that
amount every ninety minutes."

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true; 

---

<!-- "However, the case for taking seriously the prospect of a machine -->
<!-- intelligence revolution need not rely on curve-fitting exercises or -->
<!-- extrapolations from past economic growth. As we shall see, there are -->
<!-- stronger reasons for taking heed." -->

### Great expectations 

> (Machines matching humans in general intelligence)[1]—that is,
> possessing common sense and an effective ability to learn, reason,
> and plan to meet complex information-processing challenges across a
> wide range of natural and abstract domains—have been expected since
> (the invention of computers in the 1940s)[2].

**Claims**: [1] has been expected since [2].

**Subject**: When [1] has been expected since.

**Predicate**: since [2].

**Example**: *No example of someone expecting in 1940, in the book.*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 
*no-example*;

---

> From the (fact that some individuals have overpredicted artificial
> intelligence in the past)[1], however, it does not follow that (AI is
> impossible or will never be developed)[2].

**Claims**: AI is not impossible or could be developed in the future

**Checklist**: no; neither;
*future-with-no-ex*; 

---

**Claims**: From [1], [2] does not follow.

**Subject**: The future as a result of [1].

**Predicate**: [2] wont happen.

**Example**: *no-example*; Don't think it is possible to give example
for "A leads to or does not lead to B", atleast in this case.

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither;;;; if
*no-example*; *failed*; **Pattern**: *A-leads-to-B*; *failed* (didn't know
if it was possible to give example for this)

---

> The main reason (why progress has been slower than expected)[1] is that
> (the technical difficulties of constructing intelligent machines have
> proved greater than the pioneers foresaw)[2].

*because*

**Checklist**: yes; neither;  
*because-should-due-to*; *time*; (I was unsure for a bit if it really
was "because" statement);

**Summary of chapter 1**

"The AI pioneers for the most part did not countenance the possibility
that their enterprise might involve risk. They gave no lip service—let
alone serious thought—to any safety concern or ethical qualm related
to the creation of artificial minds and potential computer overlords:
a lacuna that astonishes even against the background of the era’s
not-so-impressive standards of critical technology assessment."

### Seasons of hope and despair 

> In the (six decades since this brash beginning)[0], (the field of
> artificial intelligence)[1] has been through (periods of hype and
> high expectations alternating with periods of setback and
> disappointment)[2].

**Claims**: Since [0], [1] has been through [2].

**Subject**: [1], since [0]. 

**Predicate**: has been through [2]. 

**Example**: After the Dartmouth meeting, researchers built systems
like the Logic Theorist, which was able to prove most of the theorems
in the second chapter of WhiteHead and Russell's Principia
Mathematica, and even came up with one proof that was much more
elegant than the original.

Post 1970, funding decreased and skepticism increased.

*This seems to be the best one can do while giving examples. There are
claims in the example ("post 1970..."), but atleast we can ask the
author what exactly he meant when needed to investigate further.*

**Definition**: checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true; 

---

<!-- **Combinatorial explosion** -->

> (The methods)[1] that produced (successes in the early demonstration
> systems)[2] often proved difficult to (extend to a wider variety of
> problems or to harder problem instances)[3].

**Claims**: [1] that produced [2], often proved [3].

**Subject**: Extension to harder problems based on [2],

**Predicate**: often proved to be difficult

**Example**: "For instance, to prove a theorem that has a 5-line long
proof in a deduction system with one inference rule and 5 axioms, one
could simply enumerate the 3,125 possible combinations and check
each one to see if it delivers the intended conclusion", based on the
exhaustive search method.

"Proving a theorem with a 50-line proof does not take ten times longer
than proving a theorem that has a 5-line proof: rather, if one uses
exhaustive search, it requires combing through `5^50 ≈ 8.9 × 10^34`
possible sequences—which is computationally infeasible even with the
fastest supercomputers."

**Definition**: checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true; 
*often*; *failed*; (don't know how to give an example for often)

---

<!-- **Summary** -->

<!-- Graphical models and Bayesian statistics have become a shared focus of -->
<!-- research in many fields, including machine learning, statistical -->
<!-- physics, bioinformatics, combinatorial optimization, and communication -->
<!-- theory. -->

### State of the art 

> (Artificial intelligence)[1] already (outperforms human intelligence in many domains)[2].

**Claims**: [1] already does [2].

**Subject**: [1]. 

**Predicate**: already does [2]. 

**Example**: "2010: IBM’s Watson defeats the two all-time-greatest
human Jeopardy! champions, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. Jeopardy!
is a televised game show with trivia questions about history,
literature, sports, geography, pop culture, science, and other
topics. Questions are presented in the form of clues, and often
involve wordplay." --- Games

There are not other examples of [1] already doing [2], in the section.

**Definition**: Checks out for one domain (gaming) atleast!

**Checklist**: yes; true;

---

> These achievements might not seem impressive today. But this is
> because (our standards for what is impressive)[1] keep adapting to the
> (advances being made)[2].

**Claims**: [1] keep adapting to the [2]. 

**Subject**: [1] 

**Predicate**: keep adapting to [2]. 

**Example**: In late fifties: "if one could devise a successful chess
machine one would seem to have penetrated to the core of human
intellectual endeavor."

I don't know anyone who is amazed by a chess AI today. It's the norm,
there are so many apps based on it.

**Definition**: checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true

---

### Opinions about the future of machine intelligence x

> Progress on two major fronts—towards a more solid statistical and
> (information-theoretic foundation for machine learning on the one
> hand)[1], and (towards the practical and commercial success of
> various problem-specific or domain-specific applications on the
> other)[2]—has restored to AI research (some of its lost
> prestige)[3].

**Claims**: Progress on [1], and [2], has restored [3] to AI research.

**Subject**: Progress on [1] and [2].

**Predicate**: has restored [3] to AI research.

**Example**: *No examples in the section*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 
*no-example* 

---

> One result of (this conservatism)[1] has been (increased
> concentration on “weak AI”—the variety devoted to providing aids to
> human thought—and away from “strong AI”—the variety that attempts to
> mechanize human-level intelligence)[2].

**Claims**: Result of [1] has been [2].

**Subject**: Result of [1].

**Predicate**: has been [2]. 

**Example**: *no examples in the section*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 
*no-example* 

---


> (Expert opinions about the future of AI)[1] vary (wildly)[2]. 

**Claims**: [1] varies [2].

**Subject**: [1].

**Predicate**: varies [2].

**Example**: A survey documented [here](https://intelligence.org/files/PredictingAI.pdf) shows the prediction of
Human-level AI of "experts", ranging from 2020 all the way to 2100.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true; 

---

**Summary**

"Small sample sizes, selection biases, and—above all—the inherent
unreliability of the subjective opinions elicited mean that one should
not read too much into these expert surveys and interviews. They do
not let us draw any strong conclusion. But they do hint at a weak
conclusion. They suggest that (at least in lieu of better data or
analysis) it may be reasonable to believe that human-level machine
intelligence has a fairly sizeable chance of being developed by
mid-century, and that it has a non-trivial chance of being developed
considerably sooner or much later;"



## Chapter 2 Paths to Superintelligence
### Artificial intelligence (8)

> How do we get from here to there? AI is a conceivable technology
> path.

**Claims**: AI is a conceivable technology path to go from current to superintelligent.

**Subject**: AI

**Predicate**: is a conceivable technology path to go from current to superintelligent.

**Example**: ~~"blind evolutionary processes can produce human-level
general intelligence, since they have already done so at least
once. Evolutionary processes with foresight—that is, genetic programs
designed and guided by an intelligent human programmer—should be able
to achieve a similar outcome with far greater efficiency."~~

*Crossed out above, are reasons, they are more unverified claims. You can't give
examples for "could be"*.

**Definition**: Also, what does conceivable even mean? How would I
know if it is conceivable. How would I know the definition?  Maybe if
there is an example then it is conceivable?

**Checklist**: no; neither; 
*future-with-no-ex*; *definition-unclear*;

---

> (Evolutionary processes with foresight—that is, genetic programs)[1]
> designed and guided by (an intelligent human programmer)[2]—should be
> able to achieve a (similar outcome with far greater efficiency)[3].

**Claims**: [1] designed and guided by [2] should be able to achieve
[3].

**Subject**: [1] designed and guided by [2].

**Predicate**: should be able to achieve [3].

**Example**: 

"~~If we were to simulate 10^25 neurons over a billion years of
evolution (longer than the existence of nervous systems as we know
them), and we allow our computers to run for one year, these figures
would give us a requirement in the range of 10^31–10^44 FLOPS. For
comparison, China’s Tianhe-2, the world’s most powerful supercomputer
as of September 2013, provides only 3.39×10 16 FLOPS. In recent
decades, it has taken approximately 6.7 years for commodity computers
to increase in power by one order of magnitude. Even a century of
continued Moore’s law would not be enough to close this gap~~"
 
<!-- *If we assume the calculations scratched out above as evidence , then we -->
<!-- see the evolution is not possible within this century. But any -->
<!-- calculation is not an example, just like we don't consider [Elizebeth -->
<!-- Warren's statement](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/06/17/elizabeth-warren-student-loan-debt-forgiveness/#60261e105e7b) of voiding all student debt and countering for -->
<!-- it via increasing taxes for the ultra millionaires*.  -->

*This again talks about some prediction for the future. We are not
interested in calculations, we are interested for now (for some
reason) only in examples*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither; 
*because-should-due-to*; *future-with-no-ex* 

---

> Another way of arguing for the (feasibility of artificial
> intelligence)[1] is by pointing to the (human brain)[2] and
> suggesting that we could use it as (a template for a machine
> intelligence)[3].

**Claims**: [1] can be done by using [2] as [3].

**Subject**: [1] using [2] as [3].

**Predicate**: can be done.

**Example**: ~~whole brain simulation, taking inspiration from brain,
neuromorphic approaches, recursive self-improvement~~

*Take inspiration all you want. Show me the money (examples)!*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither; 
"future with no ex"

---

**Summary**

"Lot of ways" to make SI from AI but there are currently 0 examples
for it in this section.

### Whole brain emulation (6)

**Claims**: We get from current to superintelligent by using Whole
brain Emulation.

**Subject**: That which will lead us from current to superintelligent

**Predicate**:  is  Whole Brain Emulation

**Example**: ~~"No brain has yet been emulated. Consider the humble
model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, which is a transparent
roundworm, about 1 mm in length, with 302 neurons. The complete
connectivity matrix of these neurons has been known since the
mid-1980s, when it was laboriously mapped out by means of slicing,
electron microscopy, and hand-labeling of specimens..."~~

There is no example of even a small organism whose brain is emulated
currently.

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither; 
"future with no ex"  

---

**Summary**

"Nevertheless, compared with the AI path to machine intelligence, whole
brain emulation is more likely to be preceded by clear omens since it
relies more on concrete observable technologies and is not wholly
based on theoretical insight."

### Biological cognition (8)

**Claims**: We get from current to superintelligent by using
biological cognition.

**Subject**: That which will lead us from current to superintelligent

**Predicate**: biological cognition

**Example**: ~~"Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis has already been
used during in vitro fertilization procedures to screen embryos
produced for monogenic disorders such as Huntington’s disease and for
predisposition to some late-onset diseases such as breast cancer."~~

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: No; neither;
*future-with-no-ex* 

---

### Brain-computer interfaces (4)

**Claims**: We get from current to superintelligent by using
Brain-computer interfaces.

**Subject**: That which will lead us from current to superintelligent

**Predicate**: brain-computer interfaces

**Example**: ~~"Impressive work on the rat hippocampus has
demonstrated the feasibility of a neural prosthesis that can enhance
performance in a simple working-memory task."~~

~~"This prosthesis can not only restore function when the normal
neural connection between the two neural areas is blockaded, but by
sending an especially clear token of a particular memory pattern to
the second area it can enhance the performance on the memory task
beyond what the rat is normally capable of."~~

Nothing "superintelligent" about the crossed out part.

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; true; 
*future-with-no-ex* 

---

### Networks and Organizations (4)

> (Another conceivable path to superintelligence)[1] is through the (gradual
> enhancement of networks and organizations that link individual
> human minds with one another and with various artifacts and bots)[2]

**Claims**: [1] is through [2].

**Subject**: [2].

**Predicate**: is [1].

**Example**: -

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither;
*future-with-no-ex* 

---

### Conclusion

There are many "possible paths". But all of them seem to be
predictions based on what all needs to be done. The author is claiming
that the gap to Superintelligence can be fixed if we do XYZ. For
example, they claim cyborgization of man will lead to
Superintelligence. Yet, the examples we see are the ones where
patients are able to communicate by moving a cursor over alphabets on
a screen. Another example, was the rat whose performance was "enhanced"
in a simple working-memory task. What I fail to see is an example
showing glimmers of Superintelligence, i.e., something that can do
**many things** at "**much higher performance**" than current
humans/rats/whatever.

Yes computers can beat the shit out of humans in games. Great. But we
do not seem to consider this as superintelligence. Everyone "could
do" everything in theory, but when testing a claim, we want
examples. This is very similar to people claiming "human civilization
is at risk due to AI".

### Reflection

I think, (and please take this with a grain of salt), if I had read
this book earlier, my thoughts would have been we are fucked (because
of AI). SI is coming and we would need to pick up our shit.

Hell, that hypothetical example on 80khours about how AI takes over
cancer by killing people was convincing enough for me (a few months
back). The sad part about this is that these are all hypothetical
examples. If you think 80khours and Nick Bostrom know better as they
are scientists and committed to the field of making a difference in
the world. The book is useless, if all we needed were his word to
believe something.

We would like to be able to test claims by ourselves to see what is
right or wrong. But with this book (atleast the first 3 chapters), NB
is talking about abstract stuff, that you can't feel or touch and one
that is currently not real. So it is hard to take him seriously at
this point of my CT capability. 

## Chapter 3

> This chapter identifies (3 different forms of Superintelligence)[1],
> and argues that they are, (in a practically relevant sense,
> equivalent)[2], practically relevant sense, equivalent. We also
> show that the (potential for intelligence in a machine substrate)[3] is
> vastly greater than (in a biological substrate)[4].

**Claims**: [1] are [2].

**Subject**: [1].

**Predicate**: are [2].

**Example**: ~~Superintelligence in any of these forms could, over
time, develop the technology necessary to create any of the others.~~

I don't have any examples for this other than the crossed-out claim to
support this. And I have no way of testing this crossed-out claim as
well, as it has SI as subject, for which I have zero examples.

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither;
*future-with-no-ex* 

---

**Claims**: [3] is greater than [4].

**Subject**: [3] compared to [4].

**Predicate**: is greater.

**Example**: ~~"Biological neurons operate at a peak speed of about 200
Hz, a full seven orders of magnitude slower than a modern
microprocessor (~ 2 GHz)"~~

There are many more "advantages for digital intelligence", but I don't
think it helps. Because, "potential" seems to be talking about
something that could exist and doesn't exist currently. I don't think
I can test it with an example. Just like I can't test "I have the
potential to become CEO one day". However I can test "Sundar Pichai"
has the potential to become the CEO".

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither; 
*future-with-no-ex* 

---

> (Many machines and nonhuman animals)[1] already perform (at superhuman
> levels)[2] in (narrow domains)[3]. Bats interpret sonar signals better than
> man, calculators outperform us in arithmetic, and chess programs
> beat us in chess.

**Claims**: [1] already perform [2] in [3].

**Subject**: What [1], does.

**Predicate**: perform [2] in [3].

**Example**: "Google’s AI AlphaGo has done it again: it’s defeated Ke
Jie, the world’s number one Go player, in the first game of a
three-part match."

**Definition**: If we assume "superhuman" means way better than the
average human, then yes the definition checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; neither;  

---

### Speed Superintelligence

> Because of this apparent time dilation of the material world, a
> (speed superintelligence)[1] would prefer to (work with digital
> objects)[2].

**Claims**: [1] would prefer to [2].

**Subject**: What [1] does.

**Predicate**: would prefer to [2].

**Example**: No example

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither; 
*future-with-no-ex*; 

---

> (The speed of light)[1] becomes an (increasingly important
> constraint)[2] as (minds get faster)[3], since (faster minds face
> greater opportunity costs in the use of their time for traveling or

> would require less bandwidth.

*I don't understand what they are trying to say here with this
paragraph. Why would it take a digital agent with a mental speedup of
one millx, about the same amount of "subjective time" to travel across
the globe as it does a contemporary human journeyer. What does
subjective time even mean? Information reaches far ends of this world
already within seconds. Why would it take a much faster digital agent
more "subjective time"*.

**Claims**: [1] becomes [2] as [3], ~~since [4].~~

**Subject**: [1] as [3].

**Predicate**: becomes [2]. 

**Example**: No examples here. Talking about hypothetical situations.

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 

---

### Collective Superintelligence

> (Collective intelligence)[1] excels at (solving problems that can be
> readily broken into parts)[2] such that (solutions to sub-problems
> can be pursued in parallel and verified independently)[3]. Tasks
> like building a space shuttle or operating a hamburger franchise
> offer myriad opportunities for division of labor: different
> engineers work on different components of the spacecraft; different
> staffs operate different restaurants.

**Claims**: [1] excels at [2] such that [3].

**Subject**: What [1] does.

**Predicate**: excels at [2] such that [3].

**Example**: People working together on building a space shuttle at
say NASA.

**Definition**: Does it excel though? compared to what? Speed
superintelligence perhaps! But I have no examples of speed
superintelligence*

**Checklist**: yes; neither;
*future-with-no-ex*; *definition-unclear* 

---

> Collective superintelligence could be either loosely or tightly
> integrated.  To illustrate a case of loosely integrated collective
> superintelligence, imagine a planet, MegaEarth, which has the same

> MegaEarth)[3] would constitute (a loosely integrated collective
> superintelligence.)[4]

**Claims**: [1] would be developed at [2], and [3] would constitute
[4].

**Subject**: What [1] would be developed at

**Predicate**: at [2].

**Example**: *Would be*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither; 
*future-with-no-ex*;

---

**Claims**: [3] would constitute [4].

**Subject**: What [3] would constitute.

**Predicate**: [4].

**Example**: "would"

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; false; 
*future-with-no-ex*; 

### Quality Superintelligence

> (Such examples)[0] show that (normal human adults)[1] have a range of
> (remarkable cognitive talents)[2] that are not simply a function of
> (possessing a sufficient amount of general neural processing power)[3] or
> (even a sufficient amount of general intelligence: specialized
> neural circuitry is also needed.)[4]

<!-- *This one I read a few times, and had no idea wtf NB is talking -->
<!-- about. NB is making me furious in many cases, just by not providing -->
<!-- examples and hanging on to abstract bullshit. Such a bastard he -->
<!-- is. How does he expect people to read this shit? especially if they -->
<!-- don't have a background on this and worst of all, he seems to have -->
<!-- extensively used the thesaurus to sound cool. So many words I had to -->
<!-- look up. Why not write it like Harry Potter? huh? why not? eugenics, -->
<!-- affliction, adduced, intractable, circumscribed, "dogs walking on hind -->
<!-- legs, docility"* -->

**Claims**: [2] is not a function of [3].

The claim I started with was "[1] have a range of [2] that are not
[3]", which led me astray as I chose the subject to be "What [1] have"
and was struggling to come up with something that met the large
predicate. There were too many words such as "general neural
processing power", "remarkable cognitive talents" etc... which I think
made it difficult for me to give an example that satisfied the
subject. In the end what worked seems to be, trying to get the core
claim by taking the smallest claim. I started off with "[1] have [2]."
but that was useless as it didn't make sense with [0] given as example
in the book. Then it hit me that it should be [2] is not a function of
[3]. I spent 2hrs atleast on this.

**Subject**: What [2] is not a function of

**Predicate**: [3] or [4].

**Example**: *People with autism spectrum disorders who may have
striking deficits in "social cognition" will function well in other
"cognitive domains" say like painting, playing the piano
etc...---Chapter 3 SI*. <-- I assume this to mean that autistic people
have "much lesser" [3] and [4].

The above is hardly an example. Let's consider [this](https://youtu.be/zNGjdYY7WVE?t=142), where we
see a guy with autism making highly detailed drawings of scenery.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h57TsezhYI8) is a video of a person without autism doing incredible work
with a pencil.

it.

**General rant:**

*This one I read a few times, and had no idea wtf NB is talking
about. NB is making me furious in many cases, just by not providing
examples and hanging on to abstract things (sufficient amount of
general intelligence, specialized neural circuitry), i.e., things I
have 0 examples for. How does he expect people to read this?
especially if I don't have a background on this and worst of all, he
seems to have extensively used the thesaurus to sound cool. So many
words I had to look up. Why not write it like Harry Potter? huh? why
not? Eugenics, affliction, adduced, intractable, circumscribed, "dogs
walking on hind legs", docility*.

### 1.1.1

**Claims**: Rewards increase productivity, skill, creativity (in general)

**Subject**: What rewards do.

**Predicate**: increase productivity, skill creativity. (general predicate)

**Example**: A study by Teresa Amabile takes people with "considerable
experience" in creative writing and assigns them randomly to two groups;
Intrinsic and Extrinsic groups.

The Intrinsic group of 24 were made to rank statements which were
focused on "triggering" intrinsic motivation using statements such as
"you get a lot of pleasure out of reading something good that you have
written".

The extrinsic group of 23 were made to rank statements which was
focused on "triggering" extrinsic motivation using statements such as
"You have heard of cases where one bestselling novel or collection of
poems has made the author financially secure".

After ranking statements all subjects were asked to write a poem in
Haiku style about "laughter" and were subjectively rated by 12 poets
on a 40 point scale.

| Sample size | I/E       | Avg.  | SD   |
|-------------|-----------|-------|------|
| 24          | Intrinsic | 19.88 | 4.44 |
| 23          | Extrinsic | 15.74 | 5.25 |

The two sided t-test p-value=0.005, under the null-hypothesis.

**Definition**: As this was a randomized experiment, one may infer
causation. The p-value is super low, suggesting that there is a high
chance that the questionnaires affect the creativity scores of
writers. 

If the questionnaires are ASSUMED to somehow trigger similar reactions
like "rewards", then this example matches the definition.

**Notes**

- This experiment allows to infer causation between questionnaires and
  creativity score because of the randomization.
- Inference to other populations other than the writers involved in
  this experiment is purely speculative.

**Checklist**: yes; true;
*example-matching-subject*; *time* (46mins); **Pattern**:
*claims-involving-studies*?

### 1.1.2

> Did a bank disciminatorily pay higher starting salaries to men than
> to women? Not-sure (says the book). There could be other factors.

**Claims**: The bank paid disciminatorily towards women.

**Subject**: What the bank did.

**Predicate**:  discriminatory pay...

**Example**: "mean starting salary for males is estimated to be
<span>$</span>560 to <span>$</span>1080 larger than the mean starting
salary for females for the same position (entry level clerical
employees)".

- one sided p-value <0.00001 from a two sample t-test
- CI is 560 to 1080 dollars

**Definition**: It is not possible to conclude with just the CI and
the p-value as there could be other confounding variables, such as
"initial years of experience".

**Notes**: *This is a common conclusion that causation cannot be
established with observation studies like the above.*

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 

---

**Claims**: It is not possible to establish causation with observation
studies because there could always be confounding variables

**Example**: 

*I need more information to use the same observational study as in the
previous claim to give that as example here, considering the
confounding variables*

In a 22 year study on the effect of vitamins on death
rates: "The *raw differences* in death risks for consumers of folic
acid, vitamin B6, magnesium, zinc, copper, and multivitamins are NOT
statistically significant."

Confounding variables: "Supplement users had a lower prevalence of
diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and smoking status; a lower
BMI and waist to hip ratio, and were less likely to live on a
farm. Supplement users had a higher educational level, were more
physically active and were more likely to use estrogen replacement
therapy. Also, supplement users were more likely to have a lower
intake of energy, total fat, and monounsaturated fatty acids,
saturated fatty acids and to have a higher intake of protein,
carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fatty acids, alcohol, whole grain
products, fruits, and vegetables."

When all the measured parameters were controlled for: "Of the 15
supplements that the study tracked, researchers found consuming seven
of these supplements were linked to a statistically significant
INCREASE in death risk (p-value < 0.05): multivitamins (increase in
death risk 2.4%), vitamin B6 (4.1%), iron (3.9%), folic acid (5.9%),
zinc (3.0%), magnesium (3.6%), and copper (18.0%)."

**Source**: https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/observational-studies/

**Definition**: Raw results suggest that there is the consumption of
certain vitamins do not affect the death rate. However controlling for other
"confounding variables", it shows that there is a statistically
significant (p-value <0.05) increase in death rates. 

*I wanted an example where it showed what happens when you control for
confounding variables and you don't control for them, so had to search
outside. The book didn't have it. It was an important claim so I had
to spent time on it!*

**Checklist**: yes; true; ; not-chapter

### 1.2.1

**Claims**: Causal inference can be justified by proper use of random
mechanisms.

**Subject**: Justification of causal inference by "proper" use of
random mechanisms (aka randomized experiments)

**Predicate**: can be done.

**Example**: We take the same creativity example from last time where
a randomization of the participants led to the choice in intervention;
some with intrinsic group and the others with extrinsic
group.  

**Definition**: The example could have been "justified", if this
statistical analysis matched the reality. But that is not part of
the example or info I see in the book. I currently don't have one
example even.

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 
*no-example*; 

---

**Claims**: (The chance---that the randomization turned out in such a way
that the intrinsic motivation group received many more of the
naturally creative writers)[1]---is incorporated into (the statistical
tools that are used to express uncertainty.)[2]

**Subject**: Is [1] incorporated into [2].

**Predicate**: Yes.

**Example**: We think of the creativity study from earlier. The
difference in averages from the sample was 4.14 between the intrinsic
and extrinsic group.

It is possible that there was actually no difference between the
population creativity scores of the two groups and, just by chance the
sample intrinsic group had the best creativity scorers.

This chance is calculated by: Taking all the people (along with their
group scores) and considering all possible randomizations of group
assignment. How often we get 4.14 is [1]. For the given case with 1000
randomizations we get a >4.14 only 4 times. This is `0.004`.

The p-value is 0.005 (based on statistical tools that are used to
express uncertainty).

**Definition**: [1] is 0.004 and [2] is 0.005. Checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; false; 
*example-matching-subject*; *time*; **Pattern**: no idea.; (seemed
mighty hard and convoluted, [1] especially. During the third correction
even, it took me 15 mins to understand [1].);

---

**Claims**: Is there any (role at all for observational data in serious
scientific inquiry)[1]? Yes.

**Claims**: Establishing causation is not always the goal

**Subject**: [1].

**Predicate**: is there.

**Example**: A study was conducted with 10 American men of Chinese
descent and 10 American men of European descent to examine the blood
pressure-reducing drug. The result was that the men of Chinese
ancestry tended to exhibit a different response to the drug. 

**Definition**: This does not prove causal inference that being of
Chinese descent is responsible for the difference. In fact, it could
be diet or a particular gene or something. Nevertheless, the study
provided "important" information to the doctors prescribing the drug
to people from these populations.

**Checklist**: yes; true; 

---

**Claims**: Establishing causation may be done in other ways whilst
still using observational studies.

**Subject**: Establishing causation using observational studies

**Predicate**: may be done.

**Example**: Radiation biologists counted chromosomal aberrations in a
sample of Japanese atomic bomb survivors who received radiation from
the blast, and compared these to counts on individuals who were far
enough from the blast. Although the data is purely observational, the
researchers are certain that higher counts in the radiation group can
only be due to radiation. And has thus been used to estimate the
dose-response relationship between radiation and chromosomal
aberration.

**Definition**: seems to check out.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

---

**Claims**: (Analysis of observational data)[1] may lend evidence toward
(causal theories and suggest the direction of future research)[2].

**Subject**: [1] 

**Predicate**: may lend evidence towards [2].

**Example**: Many observational studies indicated an association
between smoking and lung cancer, but causation was accepted only after
decades of OS, experimental studies on laboratory animals and a
scientific theory for the carcinogenic mechanism of smoking. 

**Definition**: It seems that those observational studies were the
first straw for further investigation. 

**Checklist**: yes; true;

### 1.2.2
	
> (Inferences to populations)[1] can be drawn from (random
> sampling studies)[2], but not (otherwise)[3].

**Claims**: [1] can be drawn from [2].

**Subject**: [1] from [2].

**Predicate**: can be drawn.

**Example**: 

	## Population
	> n <- 100000
	> x1 <- runif(n/3,1,100) # gen n/3 random numbers from 1-100
	> x2 <- runif(n/3,500,600)
	> x3 <- runif(n/3,900,1000)
	> x  <- c(x1,x2,x3)
	
	> mean(x)
	[1] 517.0248
	
	## Sample a few times
	> mean(x[sample(1:length(x),100,replace=T)])
	[1] 548
	[1] 531
	[1] 529
	

**Definition**: The sample mean is very close (6%) from the actual
mean of the population. 

**Checklist**: yes; true; ;not-chapter;

---

**Claims**: [1] cannot be drawn from non [2].

**Subject**: [1] from non [2].

**Predicate**: cannot be drawn

**Example**: Same example as above.

	## Population
	> n <- 100000
	> x1 <- runif(n/3,1,100) # gen random numbers from 1-100
	> x2 <- runif(n/3,500,600)
	> x3 <- runif(n/3,900,1000)
	> x  <- c(x1,x2,x3)
	
	> mean(x)
	[1] 517.0248
	
	## Sample
	> mean(x[1:1000])
	[1] 50.7674
	

**Definition**: When sampling is not random we don't seem to be able
to infer to population.

**Checklist**: yes; true;; not-chapter;

---

**Claims**: (Random sampling)[1] ensures that (all sub-populations are
represented in the sample in roughly the same mix as in the overall
population)[2]

**Subject**: [1].

**Predicate**: ensures that [2].

**Example**: We take the same example as above,

	## Population
	> n <- 100000
	> x1 <- runif(n/3,1,100) # gen random numbers from 1-100
	> x2 <- runif(n/3,500,600)
	> x3 <- runif(n/3,900,1000)
	> x  <- c(x1,x2,x3)


Looking at the mean of the population and the mean of
the sample, implies that the sample is a "decent" mix of the
population, courtesy of [1].

	> mean(x)
	[1] 517.0248
	
	## Sample
	
	> mean(x[sample(1:length(x),100,replace=T)])
	[1] 548
	[1] 531
	[1] 529

To suggest that [1], *ensures* [2] we toggle [1]. We take the first
100 numbers and find that it doesn't represent the population.
	
	> mean(x)
	[1] 517.0248
	
	## Sample
	> mean(x[1:1000])
	[1] 50.7674

**Definition**: Atleast there is one example where using random
sampling seems to enable inference to population and where if we
remove it, we don't get the inference to population. Checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true;; not-chapter; 
*ensures*; *unsure*; *missed-comparison*;

Does *ensure* need toggling, STM? 

---

**Claims**: (Random selection)[1] has a chance of producing
(non-representative sample)[2]

**Subject**: Chance of [1] producing [2].

**Predicate**: >0

**Example**: 

	## Population
	> n <- 100000
	> x1 <- runif(n/3,1,100) # gen random numbers from 1-100
	> x2 <- runif(n/3,500,600)
	> x3 <- runif(n/3,900,1000)
	> x  <- c(x1,x2,x3)
	
	> mean(x)
	[1] 517.0248
	
When I sampled from `X` 10000 times the mean was less than 400 only
once. It was:

	[1] 381.0892


**Definition**: Non-representative sample is off by 25%. [1] seems to
have a chance of producing [2], in this case `=1/10000`. Checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true;; not-chapter

### 1.2.3

> Statistical analysis is used to make statements from available data
> in answer to questions of interest about some broader context than

> on available data can be made with absolute certainty.

**Claims**: (No such statement about broader context based on
available data)[1] can be made with (absolute certainty)[2]

**Subject**: [1] 

**Predicate**: can be made with [2].

**Example**: ~~The same creativity study. The creative study concluded
that 'creative writers are able to write better with intrinsic
motivation'.~~ 

*No example in the book*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 
*no-example*; *time*;

---

**Claims**: (Chance mechanisms)[1] enable (the investigator)[2] to calculate
(measures of uncertainty)[3] to accompany inferential conclusions. 

**Subject**: What [1] does.

**Predicate**: enables [2] to calculate [3].

**Example**: We think of a coin toss which was used in the creativity
study. We see that we are able to compute the p-value of 0.4% for
the null hypothesis.

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true; 
*example-matching-definition*; *unsure*; *time*; **Pattern**: "Chance
mechanisms"; "measures of uncertainty"; "enable"

---

**Claims**: (Conclusions from C&E studies))[1] can be quite strong,
even if (observed pattern cannot be inferred to hold in some general
population (self-selected))[2].

**Subject**: If [2], then how strong [1] is.

**Predicate**: can be quite strong.

**Example**: *The creativity study is not the right example for this
subject, as it doesn't inform why any conclusion is particularly strong.*

*For this claim I have no example.*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 

--- 

> For (observational studies)[1] the (lack of truly random samples)[2]
> is more worrisome, because making (an inference about some larger
> population)[3] is usually the goal.

**Claims**: [1] has [2].

**Example**: We think of the 'sex discrimination by a bank' study. The
units selected for the study are part of a bank. There is nothing
random about it.

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; neither;

---

**Claims**: For [1], [2] is more worrisome

We have seen earlier that [2] results in the inability to [3] and
hence could be considered worrisome. But why it is "more worrisome"
for [1] is unclear. I don't have an example for it.

**Checklist**: yes; neither;
*no-example*;

---

> In (observational studies)[1], obtaining (random samples from the
> populations of interest)[2] is often impractical or impossible and
> inference based on assumed models may be better than no inference at
> all.

**Claims**: In [1], obtaining [2] is often impractical or impossible

**Subject**: Impracticality of obtaining [2] in [1].

**Predicate**: is often impractical

**Example**: In the Vitamin study discussed earlier, it appears that
the population of interest is the whole world. Taking random samples
from this population of interest (aka [2]), implies that we select
random people in the world and ask them to discuss their lives with us
over 22 years. But this is impractical as not everyone is willing to
participate in the study. The next "best" thing we have is that people
volunteer to the study.

**Definition**: i.e., we are unable to have [2].

**Checklist**: yes; true;; not-chapter; 
*example-matching-subject*; *unsure*; **Pattern**:

### 1.3.1 Probability model for randomized experiments

**Claims**: (The chance mechanism for randomizing units to treatment
groups)[1] ensures that every subset of (24 subjects gets the same
chance of becoming the intrinsic group)[2].

**Subject**: What [1] ensures.

**Predicate**: ensures [2].

**Example**: With 24 black cards and 23 red cards shuffled, we are able to
segregate people to the intrinsic and extrinsic group randomly.

The total available combinations `TAC=47!/23!`.

If we look at A1 to A24 taking up the intrinsic group, it looks like
the chances are `1/TAC`. If we look at A2 to A25 taking up the
intrinsic group, the chances are still `1/TAC`. For every subset the
chances seem to be `1/TAC`.

*Do I need to toggle [1] and show the result as well?*

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true; ; not-chapter;
*example-matching-definition*; *unsure*; *time*; *A-ensures-B*;
*unsure*; **Pattern**: "probability"; "ensures"

### 1.3.2 Test for treatment effect in creative study

> (The value of this test statistic is close to or far from zero)[1]? The
> answer to that question comes from what is known about how the
> (test statistic might have turned out in other randomization outcomes)[2]
> if (there were no effect of the treatments)[3]

**Claims**: What is known about [2], is the answer to [1], if [3].

**Subject**: What is known about [2], if [3].

**Predicate**: is the answer to [1].

**Example**: In the creativity study problem, it is known that the
test statistic (difference in average between both groups) of greater
than 4 is obtained only 4 times over 1000 randomized groups, under the
*null hypothesis* (no effect of the intrinsic treatment).

**Definition**: We are able to observe that the test statistic is far
away from 0 in a histogram (looking like a bell curve), as values
greater than 4 appear four times over 1000 randomizations (0.4%).

**Checklist**: yes; true;
*example-matching-subject*; *time* **Pattern**: "long-sentence"

---

**Claims**: It is possible to determine what test statistic values
would have occurred had the randomization process turned out
differently.

**Example**: In the creativity study, under the null hypothesis---that
the difference between the extrinsic and intrinsic treatments was
nothing---we now posses 47 creativity scores with which we can compute
different test statistics for other randomizations.

For current randomization the test statistic is 4. For another
randomization shown in the book the test statistic is 2.07. It is
possible to generate the test statistic for all combinations.

**Definition**: checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true;

---

> That conclusion (that the null hypothesis is wrong) could be
> incorrect, however, because the randomization is capable of
> producing such an extreme.

**Claims**: (The conclusion that the null hypothesis is wrong)[1], could be
(incorrect)[2].

**Subject**: What [1] could be.

**Predicate**: could be [2].

**Example**: *In order to see the claim to be true, I would need to
look at the actual reality and compare it with the null hypothesis. At
this point I don't have an example*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither;; 
*no-example*;

---

> The smaller the (p-value)[1], the more unlikely it is that (chance
> assignment)[2] is responsible for the (discrepancy between
> groups)[3], and (the greater the evidence that the null hypothesis
> is incorrect)[3].

**Claims**: The smaller the [1], the more unlikely it is that [2] is
responsible for [3].

**Subject**: Consequences of smaller [1].

**Predicate**: the more unlikely it is that [2] is responsible for
[3].

**Example**: 

We look at the same creativity example. The difference in the means
between the two sample groups is 4.14. Under the null hypothesis
(i.e., [2] being responsible for [3]) we see value `>4.14` appears 4
times in 1000 simulations, i.e., this implies that the null hypothesis
is unlikely. The p-value for this case is 0.004.

If values `>4.14` appears 50 times instead of 4, then p-value is 0.05
(from 0.004), and the chances of [2] being responsible for [3] is
higher.

**Definition**: I think it checks out. I "think" because, "The smaller
the p-value", is the exact same thing as "[2] being responsible for
[3].". I am unable to see them as different objects as I think they
are one and the same. So, I am not sure if this should be taken as a
claim and worked out so much.

**Checklist**: yes; true;  
*example-matching-subject*; *unsure*; *time*; **Pattern**: No-idea

### 1.4 Measuring Uncertainty in Observational studies

**Claims**: (Uncertainty measures in Observational studies)[1] are
identical to those of the (randomization test (used in C&E studies to
establish Causation))[2]. 

**Subject**: [1].

**Predicate**: are identical to [2] 

**Example**: For the 'sex discrimination study', we use the p-value,
under the null hypothesis that: the salaries were provided to the two
groups at random i.e., the salaries were shuffled amongst the
different groups.

For the 'creativity study', we use the p-value, but for a different
form of null hypothesis based on the creativity scores of the person
remaining with them and instead, the people were shuffled amongst
different groups to make the randomizations.

**Definition**: checks out that they both seem to have identical
measures aka p-value for a null hypothesis.

**Checklist**: yes; true; 

### 1.4.2 Testing for a difference in the Sex Discrimination Study

> In the sex discrimination study, there is no interest in the
> starting salaries of some larger population of individuals who were
> never hired, so a (random sampling model)[1] is not
> (relevant)[2]. It makes no (sense)[3] to view (the sex of these

**Claims**: [1], is not [2] in the context of observational studies.

**Subject**: Relevance of [1] in the context of observational studies

**Predicate**: is [2].

**Example**: -

### 1.5

> The stem and leaf diagrams show the centers, spreads and shapes of
> distributions in the same way histograms do.

**Claims**: ^^

**Subject**: Comparison of stem-and-leaf diagrams vs histograms

**Predicate**: show the centers, shapes and distributions in the same way.

**Example**: Image below (1.10 in the book), shows the stem and leaf diagram

looks like it has the Y and X axis of a histogram. If you increase the
histogram bins to show each integer or score then they coincide
exactly in shape.

I can know if something provides a firm basis for drawing inferences, only
if I get feedback from reality.

Regarding randomization, I have only the creativity study and that is
not enough for this claim. I am unable to design the experiment and
use R to simulate it. Unable!

Regarding random sampling, the claim is already proven with a

**Example**: I guess I can give an example for t-tools being used
when the population is normally distributed and checking if the
t-tools give "good" results. Or I could cite the derivation.

**Claims**: [2] is evidence in support of [1].

**Example**: Difference in lengths between the armbone of 24 adult
male sparrows that perished and 35 adult males that survived. Two
sided p-value is 8%.

**Definition**: A p-value of 8% seems to suggest only a small chance that
the null hypothesis is true. This seems to be evidence in support of
natural selection, NOT PROOF.

of twins (there by controlling for genes and socioeconomic
differences):

- average : 0.199cm^3
- SD : 0.238
- p-value : 0.6%

**Definition**: This p-value seems to suggest that the null hypothesis
(that there is not difference between hippocampus volume of the
twins), has a low chance of being true. In other words there seems to
be a good chance that there are physiological indicators associated
with schizophrenia.

**Claims**: [1] is [2].

**Example**: Randomly sampled in R was, 10000 numbers from Poisson with
lambda=1 (doesn't look normal at all). And these are the findings:

- n_sample=100
- sd(population)/sqrt(100)=0.10008 [2] 
- sd(sampling distribution of the average)=0.1004 [1] 

**Definition**: Checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true; ; not-chapter

**Claims**: [3] is more nearly normal than is [4].

**Example**: In the above case I took a Poisson distribution with
lambda=1; No one in their right mind would say it looks normally
distributed.

Contrast that to the sampling distribution of the average and it looks
like a bell curve for the example mentioned in the previous claim.

**Definition**: checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true;

**Claims**: [1] is [2].

**Example**: 

SD(Y_bar) = 0.10008
Ybar-mu = 1.02-1.0045 = 0.0155

**Definition**: I don't think it checks out. I suspect I made a
mistake with understanding what they meant by "typical size of
(Ybar-mu)". Also if you look at it, Ybar can take any value in the
whole sampling distribution depending on chance. So you will never have
the same "Ybar-mu".

Z = (estimated mean - Mean of population)/SD(estimate)

**Claims**: If [1] is normal, then [2] is [3].

**Example**: We go further with the same example we have seen till now
where a population is setup using `rpois` (Poisson distribution).

[1] looks normal (visually, like a bell curve). Now we compute
sampling distribution of Z and determine SD and mean.

mean = 0.009
SD = 1

**Definition**: Standard normal is defined by SD=1 and mean=0, i.e.,
checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

> The t-ratio does not have a standard normal distribution, because
> there is extra variability due to estimating the standard deviation

**Subject**: What t-ratio matches with.

**Predicate**: does not match standard normal distribution

**Example**: We take a Poisson's distribution with 10000 random
values and `lambda=1`. `pop.mu=0.995` & `pop.sd=0.99`.

t-ratio = (estimate-parameter)/std.error

In our case, t-ratio = `(sample.mn-population.mn)/std.error`. 

We take 100 samples and 10 units per sample. We compute the tratio and
display its mean and sd():

mean : 0.08
sd : 1.16

The mean and sd for Zratio are:

mean: 0.069
sd: 1.00

**Definition**: For a std normal mean=0; and sd=1; There will always
be some error in the values of mean and sd of the sampling
distribution. To understand how much error still allows the
distribution to be called normal, it seems to be worthwhile to have a
look at the Zratio which is expected to be std.normal if the sampling
distribution is normally distributed (which is the case here).

Looking at the t-ratio we see that it is not as std-normal as the Z-ratio.

**Claims**: The fewer the [1], the greater is [2].

**Claims**: If [1], [2] is described by [3].

**Example**: We take a normally distributed population using `rnorm`
of size 100,000 and compute the t-ratio for a sampling distribution
with sample size 10. We take 10,000 samples and the t-ratios are
computed. We take a population of 10,000 based on `rt` which samples
from a student's t-distribution. We compute the mean and sd of the
t-dist with `n-1=9` dofs. The mean and sd are tabulated as below:

|      | zratio | tratio | Students T-distribution |
|------|--------|--------|-------------------------|
| mean | -0.003 | 0.0012 | 0.005                   |
| sd   | 1.009  | 1.15   | 1.13                    |
|      |        |        |                         |

**Definition**: There is a close match between the standard deviations
but the match between the means don't seem to exist. I don't know why
and where the error in the mean is coming from.

*I don't think I can prove this without the "expected to be". So I
added it. At max I can comment on it based on the t-distribution.*

**Subject**: If [1], what mu is (expected to be).

**Predicate**: [2] 

**Example**: We come back to the twins study where one of the twins is
schizophrenic.

Here the estimate average of differences between the volume is 0.199
cm^3. The SE is determined to be 0.0615. 

We know that we are expecting a t-distribution with 14 degrees of
freedom. We look at the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile (95%
most likely values). The t-ratios are -2.145 and +2.145. This gives us
possible values of mu if the sample was drawn with the 95% most likely
values.

`-2.145<(0.199-mu)/0.615<2.145`

This gives 0.067 and 0.331

**Definition**:  Check!

**Claims**: if [3], [1] will contain [2].

**Subject**: if [3], what [1] will contain.

**Predicate**: will contain [2].

**Example**: We take a population of mean 0 and sd 1. 

For [1] we take a random sample with 100 units where we compute our
expected 95% confidence interval for the mean. We compute it as
follows:


``` R
## compute sample, se and q
x.sam <- x[sample(1:length(x),size=n.sample)]
se <- sd(x.sam)/sqrt(n.sample)
q <- qt(0.975,df=n.sample-1) ## 95% quantiles

## Computing 95%CI
mean(x.sam) + q*se
mean(x.sam) - q*se
```

`-0.011 to 0.34`.

For [2] we think of the mean of the population i.e., `0`. 

For [3], with the below code we get the t-ratio as `1.85`. This is
within the middle 95% t-sampling distribution for dof=99, i.e., `-1.98
to 1.98`.


``` R
tratio <- (mean(x.sam)-0)/sd(x.sam)*sqrt(n.sample)
tratio
```


<!-- *splitting it helped attacking this claim* *as I write this I realize -->
<!-- I don't know what this 95% CI is, in the light that I was planning to -->

**Definition**: We thus see that the CI (`-0.011 to 0.34`) contains
the mean (the population mean/parameter `0`), when the t-ratio is
within the middle 95% of the t-sampling distribution. I checked this
for a couple of random samples and it checked out for all.

*took me 3-4 hrs my-god! Seems so simple, but even on the second
revision of this post it took me 10mins to make sure I did the right
thing. The 3-4 hrs was mainly because I wanted to give an example

not figured out how to do it.*

**Subject**: [1] translating to [2].

**Predicate**: can be translated.

**Example**: For the Bumpus data of the birds that died vs survived,
we look at the Humerus length. 

For [1], we think of 95% middle t-ratios from the t-distribution with
57 dofs: 2.002 and -2.002.

For [2], we think computing the possible values of the mean using [1]
based on the formula below:

t-ratio = `(estimate-mean_under_null_hypothesis)/SE`

We have difference in sample mean, i.e., estimate =
`(Y2_bar-Y1_bar)=0.01008`, along with the `SE=0.00567`.

We have t-ratio from [1], from which we calculate [2] to be:

`-0.00127 < mean_under_null_hypothesis < 0.02143`.

**Claims**: t-tools are derived under random sampling models, when
populations are normally distributed.

Same claim as before in section 2.0.

**Checklist**: yes; true; 
*no-example*; *failed*; (am I even expected to give an example or

---

**Claims**: [1] for randomization is a useful approximation.

**Subject**: The usefulness of [1] for randomization

**Predicate**: is useful approximation

**Example**: We go back to the creativity study we saw in the first
chapter. Here, a group of "creative people" were picked and then
randomized into two interventions. The goal is to identify causal
relations between the intervention and the creativity score.

In total there were 47 people split as 23 and 24, into the different
interventions namely intrinsic and extrinsic.

Using the T-tools for randomization: For the given group we have the
t-statistic = `(4.14-0)/1.42 = 2.92`. This gives a 0.0027 p-value when
looked up on a t-distribution of 45 dofs.

The above describes "[1] for randomization".

Using the randomization procedure and a computer simulation with 500
random assignments of the people into the two groups, the real p-value
is 0.002.


<!-- We would like to compare this to the "actual". In chapter 1, there is -->
<!-- an estimation of the p-value based on the randomization -->
<!-- procedure. This is 0.004 one-sided p-value. This is obtained by -->
<!-- looking at all randomizations of the creativity scores and the -->
<!-- resulting difference between the two groups and comparing how often a -->
<!-- number as high as 4.14 is obtained. -->

<!-- 0.0027 and 0.004 both seem to give the same conclusion if we assume a -->
<!-- cutoff of 5%. but the values as such are different (48% off). The text -->
<!-- book however uses another number to compare to 0.0027. It uses the -->
<!-- p-value from the randomization procedure not of the creativity scores -->
<!-- but of the t-ratio. And then the p-value is 0.002. -->

**Definition**: The actual p-value and the approximation as a result
of [1], seem to be quite close (35% error). All we need for t-tools is
a table of values. But to determine actual values you need a computer
to perform randomizations. Hence it is a useful approximation.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

**Claims**: [1] for random sampling is a useful approximation.

Just as above was done for randomizations we can establish one for

**Claims**: [1] to determine the CI relies on testing and CI.

**Subject**: What [1] relies on.

**Predicate**: relies on testing and CI.

**Example**: We look at the same creativity study.

The "randomization procedure to determine the CI" ([1]) of creativity
study starts with looking at one value of delta.

Let's say delta=5. We subtract 5 from all scores in the intrinsic
group. Now with this homogeneous mixture, we perform the randomization
and check if the estimate has a greater probability than the two-sided
p-value. If so, then that delta=5 is within the 95% confidence
interval.

By trial and error we keep shifting delta's value to find the limits
of this 95% CI.

**Definition**: This procedure has 2 parts to it. First step involves:
Taking each hypothesized parameter value (delta=5) and then TESTING if
that probability of delta value is likely (i.e., >5% p-value). The
second step involves: doing this until you find the CI limits.

TESTING over and over again seems to lead CI. Claim checks out.

### 2.5 Related issues

**Claims**: It is difficult and unwise to decide on absolute cutoff
points for p-values in all situations.

**Subject**: How difficult and unwise, absolute cutoff points for
p-values is.

**Predicate**: are difficult and unwise

**Example**: ~~If we take the absolute cutoff point to be 5%, and we get
a sample with 5.1% p-value then we accept the null hypothesis. If we
get 4.9%, then we are going to reject the null hypothesis.~~

~~Although important for leading to advances in the theory of
statistics. The rejection region approach has largely been discarded
for practical applications and p-values are reported instead.~~

*I don't have an actual example for this.*

**Definition**: ~~Looks like choosing 5% and saying it is valid for
all cases as a hard cut-off seems to be difficult. Also choosing 5%
seems to be unwise as this would result in 2 very close percentages
being interpreted completely differently.~~

**Checklist**: yes; true;
*no-example*; 

*Writing out the subject and predicate is not overrated
after all. helps me decide what I need to give an example for.*

---

**Claims**: p-values can be comprehended by comparing them to events
whose probabilities are more familiar. 

**Subject**: Comparing p-values to events whose probabilities are more
familiar

**Predicate**: makes them comprehensible.

**Example**: We look at the probabilities with respect to a fair
coin.  
p(4 heads in a row) = 6.3%  
P(5 heads in a row) = 3.1%  
P(6 heads in a row) = 1.5%  
P(10 heads in a row) = 0.1%  

If we get a p-value of 0.1% we think that it is "rare"? Why? Unable to
test claim.

I suspect or remember reading somewhere, that p-value cutoffs are
intentionally different for different scenarios (unverified
claim). Whereas in the above we are comparing one p-value in one
scenario to another p-value in say genetics or something.

**Definition**: I don't know what "comprehensible" means here or how
to check it. Also, I am afraid it is dangerous to compare two p-values
from 2 different scenarios.

**Checklist**: yes; neither;
*no-example*; *time*; *failed*; *definition-unclear*; *very very hard*;
**Pattern**: "comprehended"; "comparing"; "p-values"

---

**Claims**: The actual confidence levels are not important for some
cases.

**Example**: Experiments were made to understand the value of the
parameter "general relativity" (gamma) and to see who was
right. Newton made a `0` prediction and Einstein made a prediction
of 1. A graph showing the value of gamma over several years of
experimentation, shows values ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 in 1920, to 0.95
to 1.05 in 1985. Just this was enough to show that the value of gamma
was closer to one than `0` from 1920 to 1985.

**Definition**: The whole spread of the gamma values shows that in
1920 the value was close to 1 rather than 0. The CI was not important
here but just the whole spread of values was taken.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

## Chapter 3 a closer look at assumptions (2)
### 3.1.1 Cloud seeding to increase rainfall (1)

> (Massive injection of silver iodide into cumulus clouds)[1] can lead to
> (increased rainfall)[2].

**Claims**: [1] can lead to [2].

**Example**:  Clouding seeding to increase rainfall randomized
experiment: 

On 52 days that were deemed suitable for cloud seeding, a random
mechanism was used to decide whether to seed the target on that day
or to leave it unseeded as a control. An airplane flew in either
cases. Precipitation was measured on those 52 days.

Estimate = 3.1 times as large as when not seeded. 95% CI is 1.3 times
to 7.7 times.

**Definition**: Since randomization was used, it is safe to infer
causality. Checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

### 3.1.2 Effects of Agent Orange on Troops in Vietnam (2)

> Dioxin levels tends to be higher for the Vietnam veterans than for
> the non-Vietnam veterans.

**Claims**: Dioxin levels in Vietnam Veterans than the non-Vietnam
veterans is higher

**Example**: Agent Orange Study :  

In a non-randomly selected sample of 646 Vietnam veterans who served
in Vietnam in most heavily treated regions with Agent Orange (Dioxin)
were selected as the test group. 97 non-Vietnam veterans who served in
US and Germany were the control. Blood tests were done on Dioxin
levels reported.

A one-sided p-value of 0.4 for the null hypothesis was obtained.

**Definition**: The p-value of 40% informs that there is not
sufficient evidence to conclude that the levels are higher for the
test group than the control. 

**Caveat**: As the sample was not randomly selected, we need to
investigate more. For example, non-participating Vietnam veterans may
have failed to participate because of dioxin-related illnesses. At
best we can say there isn't sufficient evidence and that the results
could be seriously biased.

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 

---

> Inference to populations is speculative.

*Not sure how to give an example in this context as there is no data
of the true reality to compare with (here). However we have seen
before that without randomness inference to population is
speculative.*

**Checklist**: yes; neither;  
*no-example*; 

### 3.2.1 The meaning of robustness (2)

> Actual conditions did not seem to match the ideal models upon which
> t-tools are based for both studies.

<!-- I need to probably look at normality and maybe SD of the two groups -->
<!-- and also the independence. As those are the three points they talk -->
<!-- about in the 3rd chapter. In the second chapter though, they only -->
<!-- discuss normality as a formality. -->

**Claims**: The conditions of the Seeded Rainfall study do not match
the ideal model on which t-tools are based upon.

**Example**: When we look at the box plots of the Seeded and Unseeded
samples (n=26), we see that the box plots has outliers at 2500 units,
when the median is at 250 units and the 75th percentile is at 750
units. There is ~15% of outliers, making it NON-NORMAL (highly skewed).

In addition the SD seen for now as the distance between 25th and 75th
percentile in the box plot are ranging from 0 to 750 units in the
"Seeded" group and 0 to 450 units in the other group. I.E., different
SD's for different groups.

**Definition**: Checks out that the normality is not met along with
the standard deviations of the populations being not equal (In this case it
is only possible to measure the standard deviation of the sample).

**Checklist**: yes; true.

---

<!-- *One thing I realize now that I don't know is how they are able to -->
<!-- comment on the population based on the sample. The t-tools are based -->
<!-- on population normality equal sd and independence* -->

**Claims**: The conditions of the Agent Orange study do not match the
ideal model on which t-tools are based upon.

**Example**: We look at the box plot of the Vietnam study. We see
again similar trends in outliers as in the last example. The outliers
are >4times the 75th percentile. AKA making making it NON-normal.

Looking at the SD or spread, it appears that for both groups the range
is same about: 0 to 8 units.

**Definition**: Checks out! Only the non-normality is not met.

**Checklist**: yes;true
 

### 3.2.2 Robustness Against Departures from normality (6)

> Underlying normality is not a serious issue, as long as sample size
> are reasonably large.

*no-example*; but it should be possible to simulate in a computer if needed.

> Many empirical investigations and related theory, however confirm
> that the t-tools remain reasonably valid in large samples

*no-example* (in the book). But can be simulated in a computer if needed.

> If the two populations have same (SD and approximately shapes)[1],
> and if the (sample sizes)[2] are equal, then the (validity of the
> t-tools)[3] is affected moderately by (long-tailedness)[4] and very
> little by (skewness)[5].

<!-- > If the two populations have the same standard deviations and -->
<!-- > approximately the same shapes, but if the sample sizes are not -->
<!-- > approximately the same, then the validity of the t-tools is affected -->
<!-- > moderately by long-tailedness and substantially by skewness. The -->
<!-- > adverse effects diminish, however, with increasingly large sample -->
<!-- > sizes. -->

<!-- > If the skewness in the two populations differs considerably, the -->
<!-- > tools can be very misleading with small and moderate sample sizes. -->

**Claims**: If [1] is same, and if [2] is equal, then [3] is affected
moderately by [4].

**Example**: 1000 computer simulations involving a success criterion
that 95% of the simulations will contain the parameter of interest
were performed. All the populations have the same SD and same sample
sizes.

For a given sample size and SD being equal in the population, we see
that using t-tools we get the following:

| Sample size  | Long tail | Short tail  |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| 5            | 98.3%     | 94.5%       |


*I suspect that you are going to ask me what Long tail and short tail
means. The book has some pictures of how it could look but does not
provide actual rules of thumb to identify them.*

![non-normal](./images/images-DP-11/non-normal.png)

**Definition**: Looking at the output it looks like the output is good
for both short tailed and longtailed non-normal distributions. I am
not sure it affects at all, let alone moderately. 94.5% is pretty darn
close to 95% (which is the criterion for success).

*But the book seems to suggest otherwise: "Only the long-tailed
distribution appears to have success rates poor enough to cause
potentially misleading statements."*

**Checklist**: yes; FALSE;
*example-matching-definition*; *unsure*; (book says otherwise);

---

**Claims**: If [1] is same, and if [2] is equal, then [3] is affected
very little by [5].

**Example**: Same example but this time we look at the skewedness.

| Sample size | strongly skewed | mildly skewed |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 5           | 95.5%           | 95.2%         |


**Definition**: Looks like it is barely affected as expected in the claim.

<!-- *Until I actually wrote this, I totally believed their claim.* -->

---

**Claims**: If [1] is same, and if [2] is NOT equal, then [3] is affected
moderately by [4].

**Example**: Example not available for this case.

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither;

**Example**: Example not available for this case.

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither;

**Claims**: If [5] between the two populations differs considerably,
then the tools can be very misleading with small [2]. 

**Example**: *no-example*

**Example**:

| size | strg. skewed | Mod. skewed | mild. skewed | longtailed | shorttailed |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| 5    | 95.5%        | 95.4%       | 95.2%        | 98.3%      | 94.5%       |


**Definition**: The longtailed distribution appears to have only
higher success rates than shorttailed. *How is that having poor
success rates.* No Idea.

**Checklist**: yes; false; 
*example-matching-definition*; *unsure*; (book says otherwise);

### 3.2.3 Robustness Against Differing Standard Deviations (3-4)

> In this case, the pooled estimate of standard deviation does not
> estimate any population parameter and the standard error formula
> which uses the pooled estimate of sd, no longer estimates the sd of

*no-example* but can be tested using simulations.

---

> (t-tools)[1] remain fairly valid when the (standard deviations are
> unequal)[2], as long as the (sample sizes are roughly the same)[3]. 

**Claims**: If [2] and [3], then [1] remain fairly valid.

**Example**: A computer simulation involving two populations that have
different std.deviations but are normal, turns out as below:

For n1=10 and n2=10, and sigma2/sigma1=1/4 ([2]); success rate as a result
of simulation is 95.2%.

**Definition**: [1] remains fairly valid due to the 95% success rate.
 
**Checklist**: yes; true; 

---

> (For substantially different sigma's and different n's the CI are
> unreliable)[1] (the worst situation is when the ratio of the sd is much
> different from one another, and the smaller sized sample is from the
> population with the larger sd)[2].

**Claims**: [1].

**Example**: 

A computer simulation involving two populations that have
different std.deviations but are normal.

For n1=10 and n2=40, and sigma2/sigma1=1/4; success rate as a result
of simulation is 71%.

**Definition**: unreliable indeed.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

---

**Claims**: [2].

**Example**:  Based on 1000 computer simulations on normal distributions.

| n1 | n2 | sd2/sd1 | sd1/sd2 |
|----|----|---------|---------|
| 10 | 40 | 71%     | 99%     |

**Definition**: checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; false;

### 3.2.4.1 Cluster effects and Serial effects (2-3)

> Cluster effect occurs sometimes when the data have been collected in
> sub groups. For example, 50 experimental animals may have been
> collected from 10 litters.

I don't know what this effect means or what the impact is.

*no-example* 

> The serial effect: The other type of dependence commonly encountered
> is caused in which measurements are taken over time and observations

*no-example* 


### 3.2.4.2 Effects of lack of independence (3)

> When the independence assumptions are violated, the standard error of
> the difference of averages is an inappropriate estimate of the sd of
> the difference in averages.

*can be tested but I don't know how to simulate

> misleading results.

*no-example* 

> It is unwise to use t-tools directly if cluster of serial effects are

*no-example* 

**Checklist**: yes; neither;
*no-example*; *failed*; (it is important to have examples about
independence); **Pattern**: "independence"; "t-tools";

### 3.3.1 Outliers and Resistance (3)

> Long-tailed population distributions are not the only explanation for
> outliers.

**Example**: Contamination could be another reason for an outlier.

In the Agent Orange study about US veterans and Dioxin, 2 outliers are
identified. The sample was about people who were in Vietnam in Orange rich
zones. The two outliers in this study were, one of them was not exposed
to herbicides during his stay in Vietnam. The other had 180 days of
indirect military exposure to herbicides.

**Definition**: checks out

**Checklist**: yes; true.

---

> It is irrelevant to distinguish between a natural long-tailed
> distribution and the one that includes outliers that result from
> contamination.

*no-example* *The idea is that it becomes irrelevant because they
both don't capture the group behavior. But how would I give an
example for that?* 

**Checklist**: no; neither;  
*no-example*; *failed*; **Pattern**: "irrelevant"

> It is useful to know how sensitive a statistical procedure may be to
> one or two outlying observations.

**Example**: We comeback to the same Agent Orange data. We have two
outliers here. The sample size is >600 in the case of veterans in
Vietnam. 

The one-sided p-value is 40% with all observations, 48% with one
outlier removed and 54% with both outliers removed.

**Definition**: Although the conclusion didn't change regarding
rejecting or accepting an hypothesis, the variation is quite large
between keeping outliers despite the large number of the sample.

This example I think checks out that it is useful. I think this
example is instrumental in showing the havoc, outliers can breathe
when values become closer to the "cutoff"(say 5%)

**Checklist**: yes; true;

### 3.3.2 Resistance of t-tools (2)

> Since t-tools are based on averages, they are not resistant 

**Claims**: t-tools are not resistant to outliers

**Example**: ~~In a hypothetical sample of 10,20,30,50,70, the sample
average is 36, and the sample median is 30. Now change the 70 to 700,
and we see that the average becomes 162, but the sample median remains
30.~~

*no-example*; Can be simulated.

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; true; 
*no-example*;

---

> one or two outliers can affect the CI or change the p-value enough
> to completely alter a conclusion.

*no-example* 

### 3.4.1 Consider Serial cluster effects (1)

> Were the subjects selected in distinct groups? Were different Groups
> of subjects treated differently in a way that was unrelated to the
> primary treatment? Were different responses merely repeated
> measurements of the same subjects? Were observations taken at
> different but proximate times or locations? Affirmative answers to any
> of these questions suggest that independence may be lacking.

**Claims**: If the answer to above questions is yes then it suggests
that independence may be lacking.

**Checklist**: yes; neither;
*no-example*; *definition-unclear*; *failed* (*should know how to check for
independence but not given in the text clearly*); **Pattern**: "independence";
 
---

### 3.4.2 Evaluate the suitability of the t-tools (1)

> A (transformation)[2] should be considered if the (graphical displays of
> the transformed data appear to be closer to the ideal conditions)[1].

**Subject**: If [1], Should [2] be done?

**Predicate**: should be considered.

**Example**: We go back to the Cloud seeding case study. We see in the
normal box plots that both the groups look "skewed". And the spread
(SD) looks much larger for the seeded one. 

When we make this into a logarithm chart we see that immediately the
spreads look very similar (SD similar), the skewness vanishes (closer to
normal looking). These are conditions that are close to what the
t-tools are created based on.

![cloud](./images/images-DP-11/seeded.png)

**Definition**: Checks out. We should consider it as the
transformation could make your data look more applicable to the
t-tools.

*Something more nicer would be to check the results of using the
actual values and the transformed values and seeing how different the
results are.*

**Checklist**: yes; true;

---

### 3.4.3 A strategy for Dealing with Outliers (2)

> If investigation reveals that an outlying observation was recorded
> improperly or was the result of contamination from another population,
> the solution is to correct it if the right value is known or to leave
> it out.

**Example**: We comeback to the same Agent Orange study. We have two
outliers here. The sample size is >600 in the case of veterans in
Vietnam. 

The one-sided p-value is 40% with all observations, 48% with one
outlier removed and 54% with both outliers removed.

Here even though it does not affect the conclusion of this study, the
variation in the p-value is 14%.

**Definition**: Quite a large variation, and by removing them we are
more closer to the truth (without contaminants).

*This is the best example I have, unfortunately it doesn't show a
failing case.*

**Checklist**: yes; neither;

---

> An important aspect of adopting this procedure is that an outlier
> does not get swept under the rug simply ~~because it is different from
> the other observations.~~

**Claims**: Using careful examination as shown in fig.3.7, we prevent
contaminants from influencing the result.

**Subject**: Prevention of using careful examination

**Predicate**: prevent contaminants from influencing the result.

**Example**: We take the same example as before. We find the
contaminants and remove them there by not allowing the contaminants to
affect the result.

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: yes;true; 
*subject-predicate-split*; *unsure*; *time*; (15 mins); "Using XYZ, we
do ABC"

---

### 3.4.4 Agent orange (2)

> the skewness is mild and unlikely to cause any problems with the
> t-test or the CI (for the Agent orange study)

**Claims**: The skewness in Agent Orange study is mild

**Example**: We look at the skewness below (pg67). Here the tail is
long on one side and there seems to be a relatively smaller tail on
the other side.

![agent-orange](./images/images-DP-11/agent-orange.png)

**Definition**: Looking at the picture below (pg61) describing mild
skewness, we see that a mild skewness looks such that there are tails
on both sides, but the tail on one side is shorter.

*Yes it seems quite subjective, as the book does not seem to want to
quantify it*

![skew](./images/images-DP-11/skew.png)

**Checklist**: yes; true.
 
---

**Claims**: The skewness is unlikely to cause any problems with t-test
or the CI.

**Example**: *It is possible to run a computer simulation on a similar
problem based on this skewness and number of units in a sample, to
test it. But not for this exact study.*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither
*no-example* 

### 3.5.1 The Logarithmic Transformation (1)

> The most useful transformation is the logarithm for positive data.

*It is unclear against what dimensions this is most useful. I could
probably show in an example, say with the Vietnam war study, that log
works better in this case, but going to MOST from here I have no idea
how to go about it.*

**Checklist**: yes; neither; most; 
*no-example* ;*failed*; **Pattern**: *most*; "lack-of-examples"

### 3.5.1.1 Recognizing the need for Log (5)

> The data themselves usually suggest the need for a log
> transformation. If the ratio of the largest to the smallest
> measurement in a group is greater than 10, then the data are
> probably more conveniently expressed on the log scale. If the
> (graphical displays of the two samples show them both to be skewed)[1]
> and if (the group with the larger average also has the larger spread)[2],
> the (log transformation)[3] is likely to be a good choice.

**Claims**:  If [1] and [2], then [3] is a good choice.

**Example**: We take the cloud seeding example. We plot the box plot
and see that the data is "moderately skewed" (according to some
graphical display on pg61). Also the seeded group has much larger
spread (median @250 and extreme at 2500), than unseeded (median @150
and extreme at 1250).

Taking log transforms we get two groups that have the same spread and
very little skewness.

![seeded](./images/images-DP-11/seeded.png)

**Definition**: The initial groups aren't expected to work with
t-tools due to long-tailedness of the sample (as seen before). After
transformation they would work with t-tools as there is no skewness or
long-tailedness and both groups have the same spread, which is what
the t-tools can work reliably on (as seen before).

**Checklist**: yes; true;
*example-matching-definition*; *time* (20mins).

---

> The overall result is that the (two distributions on the transformed
> scale)[1] appear to be (symmetric and have equal spread)[2]--- just the right
> conditions for applying the t-tools.

**Claims**: [1] appears to be [2].

**Example**: Same example as above.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true
 
 ---

**Claims**: If two distributions have symmetric and equal spread, then
they have right conditions for applying t-tools.

**Example**: *Don't have an example. A computer simulation providing
the success rate would be the check.*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither;
*no-example* 

---

> Small numbers get spread out more, while large numbers are squeezed
> more closely together (as a result of log transformation)

**Example**: If you look at a log plot and divide it equally... then
this is what you see...

1-10 say corresponds to 2units. 10 to 100 has the same 2 units. And
100 to 1000 has the same 2 units. It can be visualized in the previous
figure.

**Definition**: checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true

### 3.5.2 Interpretation after a Log Transformation (1)

> For some measurements, the results of an analysis are appropriately
> presented on the transformed scale. 

**Example**: The Richter scale is used to measure earthquakes'
strength.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

---

### 3.5.2.2 Population model (5)

> Taking the (antilogarithm of the estimate of the mean on the log
> scale)[1] does not give (an estimate of the mean on the original
> scale)[2].

**Example**: For [1] : we get 169.01 for the seeded case in the
cloud seeding example.

	exp(mean(df$lograin[df$Treatment=="Seeded"]))
	
For [2], we compute the mean of the rainfall in the original scale = 441

	mean(df$Rainfall[df$Treatment=="Seeded"])

**Definition**: Checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true; 
*definition-unclear*; *time* (20mins); **Pattern**: "long phrases?"

---
 
> If, log-transformed data have symmetric distributions, then 
> Mean[logY] = Median[logY]

**Example**: 

	summary(df$lograin[df$Treatment=="Seeded"])
	Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
	1.411   4.581   5.396   5.134   6.001   7.918

**Definition**: Although this treatment does not result in totally
symmetric distribution (still has a small tail on one side), it still
manages to keep the median and mean close by. So good enough and
checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

---

> It is evident that (the anti logarithm of the mean of the log
> values)[1] is the (median on the original scale of measurements)[2].

**Example**: We think of the same cloud seeding example:

For [1] we think of

	exp(mean(df$lograin[df$Treatment=="Unseeded"]))
	= 54
	
For [2] we think of 

	median(df$Rainfall[df$Treatment=="Unseeded"])
	= 44

**Definition**: 

	summary(df$Rainfall[df$Treatment=="Unseeded"])
	Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
	1.00   24.82   44.20  164.59  159.20 1202.60 

The data taken is not fully symmetric. It still has some
tails. Despite that [1] is a close match to the median in the normal
scale.

**Checklist**: yes;true;

--- 

> A problem with interpretation on the original scale arises 

**Claims**: (A problem)[0] with (interpretation on the original
scale)[2] arises if we use (log transformation)[1].

**Subject**: If [1], Is [2] expected to arise?

**Predicate**: yes.

**Example**: 

In the case of log transformation (as shown in the previous example):

For [2], we think of the previous example where the 'antilog of mean
of log values' is the median in the original scale and NOT THE MEAN.

	#antilog of mean of log
	exp(mean(df$lograin[df$Treatment=="Unseeded"]))
	= 54
	
	#Actual mean and median
	summary(df$Rainfall[df$Treatment=="Unseeded"])
	Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
	1.00   24.82   44.20  164.59  159.20 1202.60 

**Definition**: Whether it is a problem I am not sure. I think the
author just wanted to inform that you wont get the MEAN anymore in the
original scale, after the log transformation---which is true. So I say
it checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true;
*example-matching-subject*; *time*; **Pattern**: "interpretation"; "original-scale"

> `exp(Z2bar-Z1bar)`estimates `Median(Y2)/Median(Y1)`

**Claims**: ^^

**Example**: *Either I can simulate and show this using computer
simulations in R. OR I provide the proof as in the text book. Proof is
not an example. So the best I can do is a Computer simulation. I skip
these type of simulations now*

> The point of the above is that a very useful multiplicative
> interpretation emerges in terms of the ratio of population medians.

**Claims**: (Multiplicative interpretation in terms of the ratio of
population medians)[1], emerges from the (previous claim)[2].

**Question**: Does [1] emerge from [2].

**Example**: So basically there is a `log A - log B` which becomes
`log[A/B]`. When you take the antilog you get ratio of A and B. I am
not sure I can show this in an example. I don't have an example.

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 
*no-example*; *failed*; *time*; *example-matching-subject*; *failed*;
**Pattern**: "A-emerges-from-B"; "related-to-derivation" (Very hard this was)

**Claims**: The emerged multiplicative interpretation is very useful.

**Example**: After using the log transformation and performing the
t-test on the Cloud seeding data, we see that the confidence interval
suggests that the rainfall is 1.27 times to 7.74 times higher in the
case of seeded.

**Definition**: The log transformation seems to allow to interpret the
original data in terms of ratio which is useful to understand the
outcome. Not sure how it is "very useful"

**Checklist**: yes; neither;
*definition-unclear*;

---

> In addition, (back-transforming the ends of a confidence interval
> constructed on the log scale)[1] produces a (confidence interval for the
> ratio of medians)[2]

**Example**: No example.

*The only way to show this seems to be through a computer
simulation. With the studies given in the book, it is not possible to
tally this claim. For example, with the Cloud seeded study, I can
compute the confidence intervals on the log scale and back transform
it. To check if the number produces a CI of the ratio of medians I
have nothing to check it against.*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; 
*no-example*; 

### 3.5.2.3 Example (sex discrimination) (1)

> Graphical displays of the log-transformed salaries indicate that
> analysis would also be suitable on the log scale.

**Example**: Looking at the male and female histograms

1. `hist(df$logSalary[df$Sex=="Male"])`

Looks symmetric with very short tail (very little skewness and
short-tailed histogram). The spread ranges from 8.4 to 9.0 = 0.6

2. `hist(df$logSalary[df$Sex=="Female"])`

Has a small tail (mildly skewed and short-tailed histogram). The
spread ranges from 8.26 to 8.74 =0.48 

**Definition**: Both histograms seem to be close to normal and have
similar spread which are roughly ideal conditions for applying
t-tools, and hence make analysis also suitable for the log scale.

**Checklist**: yes; true.

### 3.5.3 Other transformations for Positive measurements (5)

> There are other useful transformations for positive measurements
> with skewed distributions where the means and standard deviations
> differ between groups.

*no-example* *No example of actually applying another transformation
is given.* 

> The square root transformation applies to data that are counts.

*no-example* 

> The reciprocal transformation 1/Y applies to data that are waiting
> time

*no-example* 

> The arcsine square root transformation and the logit transformation
> apply when the measurements are proportions between zero and one.

*no-example* 

> Only log gives such ease in converting inferences back to the
> original scale of measurement.

*no-example* 

> Situations arise where presenting results in terms of population
> medians is not sufficient.

*no-example* 

### 3.6.1 Prefer Graphical Methods over Formal Tests for Model Adequacy

> Tests for normality and tests for equal sd are available in most
> computer programs.

*no-example* 

> The diagnostic tests are not very helpful for model checking.

*no-example* 

> Graphical displays provide a good indication of whether or not the
> data are amenable to t-analysis and, if not, they often suggest a
> remedy.

**Subject**: What Graphical displays provide

**Predicate**:  a good indication of ... t-analysis

*Claim dealt with before with the seeded cloud study in section ... ???*


**Claims**: Graphical displays, when data are not amenable to
t-analysis, often suggest a remedy.

*no-example*

### 3.6.2 Robustness and Transformation for Paired t-Tools (2)

> When the (observations within each pair are positive)[1], either (an
> apparent multiplicative treatment effect (in an experiment))[2] or a
> tendency for larger differences in pairs with larger average values
> suggest the use of log transformation.

*Dealt with similar claim in section 3.5.1.1*

### Summary (1)

> This is the situation where log-transformation confirms the adequacy
> of the transformation.

## General statistics

Over the past 2 months I have been working on this and the essay on
"working on failures". It took a "lot of time" to read and work out
the claims, identifying my failures, to find a way to make the
first practice session, write some bash scripts etc... Also the books
I took were a lot of work (10 claims per hour was very very rare). I
can't remember spending 2 months for roughly 250 claims. In between I
also spent time to write some bash scripts that would process my
failures and give me stats such as below:

**Total claim:** 136

**Failed:** 49 claims

**Failure types** as seen below:

*example-matching-definition*: 11

*no-example*: 23

*definition-unclear*: 2

*subject-predicate-split*: 1

*example-matching-subject*: 8

*because-should-due-to*: 2

I guess the plan would be to take types where I have failed the most
and practice them and follow it up with feedback if it has helped. How
do we know if something has helped is to see a SCORE. So for example,
if I see only 5 *no-example* failures instead of 23, in the next
practice session of the same books then it would be considered an
improvement in Score.

**Over the last two months**

Amount of effort (not just DPing) put on average per week (not only
DPing): 20hrs per week or 2.8 hrs per day avg (Courtesy:Org-mode,
PNN). Its not great, its not what I set out for in march which was 4
hrs.

## Appendix: Round 1

I try to count distractions (acronym:dist), and how much time I spend per
phrase/claim, how much time I spend on reading etc...
