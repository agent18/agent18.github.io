Today I plan to give a summary of this, with things I don't understand and move on to the next post. But first I pust paraphrase until the end of this post.

#### Feeling rational

>Becoming more rational—arriving at better estimates of how-the-world-is—can diminish feelings or intensify them. Sometimes we run away from strong feelings by denying the facts, by flinching away from the view of the world that gave rise to the powerful emotion.  If so, then as you study the skills of rationality and train yourself not to deny facts, your feelings will become stronger.

I have nothing to add. I do not get what he is trying to say. I don't understand what he is talking about.
