## Mission

>Mission #2: Collect actual, everyday instances where you fell short
>because of lack of "critical thinking" (why am I putting "critical
>thinking" in scare quotes?) and divide them into skills. No abstract
>skills like "logical structure" or "critical thinking". Concrete
>instances where you failed. That will give you harsh feedback. If you
>stop failing, it means your deliberate practice is working. If not,
>it means it's not working, even if you think you're doing
>great. NINRTT. Then, come up with rough deliberate practice plans for
>the skills based on the three models.

>this could be "I didn't spend much this month" (but you didn't even
>look at the actual debits on your bank account) or "the gym will be
>open till 9pm" (and you go there and find out it closed at 5pm
>because of Fall break, which you could have looked up on the

## What do I need to do

- Write several instances where your thinking failed you

- Identify the skills from those instances.

- Provide a point-by-point training session design. Just like your
  workout schedule where you know the entire plan for the week, month even.
  
- We need to design our own practice sessions as these are not well
  established techniques like in sports to improve performance.

- There are 2 key aspects : 
	
	- doing something you couldn't do earlier 
	
		Like say gaining the ability to do Data Science or critical
        thinking like never before for example.
		
	- and then doing it on demand
		
		Like, knowing about scope sensitivity and applying it
        everytime you see there is an opportunity. Knowing the
        scienctific method and applying it everysingle time to
        understand or predict things.
	
- as said before I think I am good to go! what is the point of
  Critical thinking anyway? Where can I improve? Do I need to even
  improve?

My friend was cooking on a teflon pan which had much of its teflon
removed over usage. And he said, "eating teflon is not injurious to
health". Without any hesitation I have been eating that food for 2
years now. In another instance my friend said, "slightly burnt food is
carcinogenic". I ran away from "carcinogenic food" ever since. I didn't
even check it. I didn't need to?

I stopped wearing earplugs because I was afraid they would cause ear
infection and suffered a plethora of distraction. The difference is
quite a lot with and without this device.

There are a lot of students and people in my city who smoke. Usually
while biking, or driving cars or outside buildings (almost in front of
the door). During all these times I have come to experience
frustration even if it is passive smoking for less than 10 seconds a
day. I hold my breadth, curse the guys who are smoking and keep
walking. But somehow if people smoke weed I don't have any
problem. Hell I would smoke it even with them, you know cause of the
aura around weed. But suprise motherfucker joints usually have 30-50%
of tobacco. meh! its ok! Allias paradox? Well before that I just
accept claims as a result of the influx of info around me. There is
nothing emperical about it.

I drink protein shake twice a day for a while now. I have just
accepted that it is ok! For the third time in the day I get protein
from another source. 

Drinking beer every week to the exact amount I drink, should cause no
harm to my health over the long term. Pfff! it gets off your system in
the form of piss. The point is, given the opportunity, I wouldn't
hesitate to drink often. In India last year, I drank 4-5 times in a
week. Hmmm, so what is good for you again? I accept implicitly that as
long as I am not a drunkard (someone who has to drink everyday) --- I
consider my self a social drinker --- I will be in exceptional health.

I will find a house in the next 10 days if I put all my effort in
it. So far it has been a long long while and it is very hard to find a
house. 

That I will find a job in less than 3 months once my company goes
bankrupt and that that time will be peaceful. The last time I found a
job took me a few months of practice followed by 3 months to land a
job. With experience it might be easier (which is the case now), but
considering the process times taken by companies, it could be a real
big nightmare.

**Impact of lack of such a skill**

In all of the above cases, it appears that it is quite important to
know the truth as I care extremely much about my health and my
long-term happiness. Researching before accepting claims as
evidence could benefit me quite a bit.

**So how do I improve this?**

'Not accepting a claim without empirical evidence (EE)', is easy. The skill
as such is straight forward, it is the applying of it on demand or
unconsciously at random times of the day which is the main problem. In
any case it looks like 1. it requires training to identify such claims,
and 2. the training to look up or determine the EE. 

**What does EE or lack there of look like?**

Improving the first part 'identifying claims that have no
emperical evidence' seems like it is similar to the music model,
i.e., high focused repetition of task. So how would the DP of this
look like?

I could start by saying I will be conscious and collect 100 claims
without EE in day to day conversations by the end of the week. The
idea I think is to train the brain to notice the claims being made and
separating them as ones with evidence and ones without. But I reckon
it will be hard, although forced with a deadline, I reckon it will be
mind numbingly hard to stay focussed on every conversation and every 
thought in an attempt to meet the goal of 100 claims. Hmmm, so it is
going to be painfull, and in large numbers and your focus is probably
going to be only about this. That seems about right. This way we can
initiate the training process.

Another method could be to look at a source, a text or anything, and
determine the claims without and with EE. So this source could be
everything from the news, news comedies, political discourses, opinion
speeches, articles on life, religious preachings, my own writings,
writing of rationalists etc... I would like to keep the source
spanning various fields so that I can get a different ratios of claims
with EE and without EE. For example, Religious preachings/debates,
flat-earth discussions will give you a taste of predominantly claims
without EE, and writings of Eliezer Yudkowsky, Paul Graham and STM
could give you a taste of claims with EE. Differentiating all of them,
seems like it will help and would allow practicing in large volume. In
addition, I could as an everyday task, identify 10 claims made during
the lunch conversation and 5 claims made during the rest of the day
during interactions with colleagues. This becomes like in the music
model, you would like to practice at home in high volume, but you
would also like to play shows or play for an audience (on demand). On
demand, as in where required.

**But what about feedback?**

During both the methods the surprises I get now and then could be
feedback about how bad/good I am. Engaging in questioning and
evaluating if something has EE or not could in itself be instructive
(in case obtaining feedback is hard). For both the above proposed
methods, following it up with a blog post to explain why something has
EE and something doesn't have EE will help. This can be used to get
feedback from external readers once in a while. This feedback will
tell you if the direction you are steering in is right or wrong and
where you need focus.

**More**

In piano playing the way to become a master at playing a piece usually
starts with slowly reading the piece and playing it, no tempo
nothing. And then once you get the hang of it, we work on tempo, and
then add more details as we get better. In our situation I think we
should do the same. We should intially read an essay of 1k words with
the sole purpose of identifying 'claims with/without EE'. After a few
days when I forget what the article was about, I do the same 1k words
within a tighter time limit. This way I can test if I am getting better.

**What if there are some types of claims that you don't notice?**

There is a chance that I don't notice some of the 'claims without
evidence', in that case it would be nice to have external feedback
from someone who is better than you once in a while and focus training
to identify exactly that.

**Training to determine EE**

I would expect from me to determine EE for 1k claims. Obtaining claims
shall be easy. I can take them from my own life or the sources
suggested above. Determining EE for different types of claims would be
different. If the claim is that 'eating teflon is good', then I would
look at sources like stackexchange to give me info. If the claim was
that 'climate change is a hoax', I would spend time reading a couple of
articles I can find on Google that have citations and look into those
citations and check if the articles are credible. Opinion posts shall
be avoided as much as possible.

I guess the best way to go about it is to gather all the claims to be
investigated (atleast a 100 of them), classify them roughly on the
basis of the method of expected method of finding EE. And then take
each class and practice. This should be done on 1000's of claims
atleast. Finally a post on the different methods of finding EE with
concrete examples, with identifying what counts as EE.

**Feedback**

How would I know if I have the right EE or not? Well I guess I might
need to go with the same explanation that it is hard to know, but the
intense study of these things should in themselves be instructive. Of
course like always, when in doubt or when you would like feedback in
certain aspects, it is best to write a post and ask some one better
than you to evaluate and give feedback on how to get better and take
it from there.

I keep track of the number of hours I spend on writing/blogging, and
also the number of hours I clock everyday to do useful work. This I
often look back at, to see my average, how good I did for the week,
which day I slacked off and why and see if I can find patterns and
correct my behavior. And feel good when I have exceeded or maintain
the standard I have set for myself. In a similar way feedback for
these can be thought of as well. The number of claims that I should
theoretically come across should be very similar with every week. So,
if I record the number of claims that I encountered per day, the
number of claims I looked for EE and the number of claims I
successfully found EE for, then over a week I have statistics. And
logging this over time, I could get a lot of feedback about my
progress, and level. 

### Solving problems in life

I see that I want my thinking to be able to solve all my problems to
the best extent possible. Some of the problems I see myself constantly
facing everyday are categorized as:

#### doing somethings despite evidence and hoping for results

Here i think the skill is mainly to note tht such frustration is
happening. To DP this, it would mean to train to be aware of such
situations. Where the hell can I find a googleplex of such issues?
Story books? give me one example, boye! or the news? where people do
the same thing over and over again


Forcing me to come up with evidences around me, in the world in the
news per day. Where people commit the same problem again and again and
see hope for different results.

One example could be to come up with all the instances when I do this,
when my friends do this, 


example, engaging in drama again and again, hoping for a gf in a girl
who has pretty much given up on you again and again!, Where I do the
same thing over and over again.. It is good if you do something else
and then thats great. 

Walking on a mine field with my colleague for example, 
#### Procrastinating on important things

Probably because it is a hard problem to solve. I usually
procrastinate on these. How do I do DP on this?

Where can I find a googleplex of problems to solve in a particular
domain.  I seem to think solving problems in a particualar domain
would need domain knowledge and so I tend to group things
together. but somehow once I group them, then I am unable to find a
large number of problems to work on. The concept of DP is all about
pracicing specific skills. 

So I don't want to procrasitnate on things that are important. This
could be divided as improving my ability to solve problems at
will. Is it cool if I work on some random math problems? The problems
I have in life are abundant, so I try something and I will get
feedback if I solved it or not. This I can apply by making a lost of
all my problems and going after it one after the other, with the
strict focus of predicting a solution. Trying the solution should give
feedback. So for example a training session would look like, making a
list of 50 problems to solve, and then taking them on one per day and
writing a solution for it as far as we can get and see how the
solution fares in real life.

#### Making better predictions
#### inability to solve problems related to motivation

**How to get better at solving problems like the above?**

Just trying to solve the problem is not enough. You need to break it
down into skills and apply it in particular ways. The chess model
sugests the use of test cases and compare your perfromance to the
actual performance


Making better predications for example, seems to require you to predict
many things and test how you fared and learn from that.  but what will
you predict? I just want to make sure I am motiavted
regularly. Solving it means taking action, making an hypothesis
narrowly and then testing it. if it works you get a point if it
doens't you don't.


### identifying skills

<!-- dealing with unknown problems --> I was asked to deal with a
trouble ticket which I had barely any experience with. I had a look at
it and had come back to my DL to explain to him what the deal was and
as expected I stammered, I stuttered. I was slightly all over the
place. I was not clear in my head, atleast I couldn't see the flow of
thoughts. In the end I managed, owing to making notes in notebook
(observation, hypothesis, questions about domain knowledge). The
following skills are what I see that I am missing:

- inability to communicate what is in the head in a systematic way (STAR)

- inability to solve an unknown problem (by asking the right questions)

	Well you don't need to solve an unknown problem, but you need to
    be able to ask the right questions to get more information about
    an unknown problem.
	
Had a meeting with my boss and another colleague (same age,background
everything), to discuss an issue and how to solve it. I sucked, the
colleague who was into these kinds of trouble shooting didn't suck at
all, my boss was on top of everything. I was surprised my colleague was
this good, in the sense that he was able to propose hypothesis and
quickly look at pros and cons with a neat focus on the goal. Whereas I
had a bowl of thoughts being tossed inside my head, struggling to make
any reasonable contribution.

- inability to apply the scientific method to solve problems where
  information is all over the place, lot of information (more like an
  investigation)

- lack of domain knowledge

- inability to do some beuracratic work to get more info.

<!-- So inability to state a narrow falsifiable hypothesis and
verify it -->
Another time with moderate understanding of tolerance trains I spent
several hours with myself trying to puzzle something out. In the end I
never got to the end. I was going in circles unable to understand if
what I came up with was right or wrong. I was unable to communicate it
to others. I tried. I sucked, many times. I was not able to prove or
disprove something that I had in mind and was struggling to convey
even to myself. 

- inability to make and test narrow falsifiable hypotheses 

<!-- inability to explain what I have in my head to other or to myself -->

I often have heard that you understand something when you are able to
make another person understand what you know. Today I was talking to a
colleague, who suggested he would be doing cardio 2 times a week for 1
hr and would hope to reduce weight keeping everything else constant. I
was like, I stuttered stammered, didn't get anywhere. This informs me
that I suck at the science of cardio. 

- inability to understand complex concepts (to be tested by
  application and /or prediction)

### Not committing the allias paradox

I think I am committing the allias paradox. 

Scene A:I spent 1k euros without flinching in a month on uber, beer,
buying clothes and paying for my license.

Scene B: I need to buy a hand sanitizer for 2.5€ and I am hesitating
if I should buy it (not considering that it could save me from falling
sick at work).

I don't understand the value of money and have a very contrasting view
of it. This is a problem that needs to be solved by itself. But this
is how my allias paradox looks.

If I do not want to commit the allias paradox what should I do?

### Understanding things

Cardio failing to understand it.

## skills 2

### Appling theory to life

### Becoming better at rationality

### Inability to organize information in my head

You can only hold 7 pieces of info... but...

### inability to communicate what is in the head in a systematic way

Due to the lack of clarity in my head I often am unable to communicate
with people around me. I don't have a filter or a systematic way of
delivering information for people to process. I often start at a point
and then realize I forgot to tell something else and start over
again. This happens often in my work place, when in general I am
trying explain something that I have not much understanding of. The
later beckons for more understanding Period! The former is about
delivering information. 

I also notice the "same" thing in writing I think. I write all over
the place and then work on re-arranging things over multiple
iterations and re-reading which gives me feedback. First of all it is
painful to do something like that where I don't have clarity of what
happened until now.

I was asked to deal with a trouble ticket which I had barely any
experience with. I had a look at it and had come back to my DL to
explain to him what the deal was and as expected I stammered, I
stuttered. I was slightly all over the place. I was not clear in my
head, atleast I couldn't see the flow of thoughts. In the end I
managed, owing to making notes in notebook (observation, hypothesis,
questions about domain knowledge)

This is almost everytime, whenever I have to discuss with my DL
anything, I struggle to get shit out of my mouth in an organized
manner. 

**How to DP**

During interviews I have found the STAR method (situation, Task,
Action, Result) to allow me to deliver my thoughts in an organized
manner. This I used to practice on everything that I was going to
deliver and managed. Deliberately practicing this can have a
pronounced effect on my speech and maybe writing even. I suspect STAR
might not be appropriate for delivering the above scenario
suggested. For the above case, I would first like to deliver the
Problem, the observation, followed by a hypothesis and then followed
by test and results if applicable i.e., POHTR (Potter).

So the goal is to use this framework while communicating to allow for
clarity. Improving this skill is very similar to the music
method. Focused simulation of an isolated skill. So practicing
explaining using the POHTR method for a 1000 problems is something
that I should aim for. Where will I get so many topics to talk about?
Well, I could take sources from the NEWS, news comedies, TED talks,
discussions on LessWrong and even the HPMOR work by Eliezer
Yudkowsky. Hopefully summarizing these topics will in addition to the
skill give me more understanding of the topics dealt with. The same
exercise can be used for both writing and speech.  

As for feedback, obvious feedback is you apply the above techniques in
situations in real life and see if you stammer or stutter over
time. For immediate feedback, I think I can re-read my essays, or play
my explanation-voice-recordings and determine how good or bad the
organization of thoughts is. Maybe other aspects to improve turn
up. An STM can give me feedback when he has time. For more feedback
you can ask your friends to listen to your discourse on youtube or
your blog to give feedback of how much they understood or what you
need improve on.

### inability to think like an STM

propose actions to solve problems

### inability to solve unknown problem

At work I often get problems that I have no clue about. And it is my
task to work on solving them by asking the right people for help or
knowledge, going over the observations, proposing a hypothesis and a
test.

Had a meeting with my boss and another colleague (same age,background
everything), to discuss an issue and how to solve it. I sucked, the
colleague who was into these kinds of trouble shooting didn't suck at
all and my boss was on top of everything. I was surprised my colleague
was this good, in the sense that he was able to propose hypothesis and
quickly look at pros and cons with a neat focus on the goal. Whereas I
had a bowl of thoughts being tossed inside my head, struggling to make
any reasonable contribution.

So looking at a lot of information all over the place, sometimes an
overwhelming amount even, already throws me off. I would like a way to
focus on what is important and why and improve my skills in solving
unknown problems, i.e., be much greater than my colleagues and DL. 

**How to DP**

>Coming to the applications: Much of "critical thinking", I would
>argue, falls under the chess model. The music model applies when you

>experts.

Luckily for me there is a plethora of trouble tickets (TTs) at my work. I
could say spend some time after work everyday, with the focus of
training my problem solving capability. Here domain knowledge might be
quite important, but as I said, I always worked on unknown problems
(atleast thats how my DL trains me to handle new modules), its also a
way to learn about the system. So to keep it less overwhelming I am
going to look at TTs that are slightly in my domain. I should take a
look at few entries in the TT and propose the next step, compare with
the actual entry and see just like in the chess model.

>Real world as it is makes it hard to evaluate which of the proposed
>solutions is better. In any case the process of focusing on the
>problem and evaluating solutions is in itself instructive. 

My DL constantly works on solving some kickass problems for the
company. He gives his team the lame work and sometimes the nice
challenging work as well. I could look at the problems he has
solved. Not surprisingly I see that he uses the scientific
method. There is a clear statement of observations, followed by some
hypothesis that made it and some hypothesis that already failed, with
some clear tests. I could look at the problems he has solved and do
the same exercise of predicting what I would do.

Taking things to the logical conclusion. Well an STM seems to be
solving problems and some of it is online. Same excercise.

**What about feedback?**

The obvious feedback is that you would feel quite confident and ready
to attack problems coming to your desk. The feedback while working on
DP looks like it is built-in within the problem solving framework. I
could collect some statistics such as responses which are correct over
a week against the total responses made, time spent on solving
problems to allow me to know how I am doing.


### Suck at using the scientific method

where info is all over the place, lot of information (more like an
investigation)

### Lack of domain knowledge

### Inability to make and test narrow falsifiable hypothesis

Understanding motivation


### Inability to understand complex concepts

## My failures
	
- Every night when I go back home, I want to put my youtube down so I
  can sleep soon 
  
What can your critical thinking do for you?

- I know I don't have a house at the end of this month and I can't
  find a cheap one, yet for somereason I am still cool about
  things. Right now I have no real source of finding a house and am
  not really taking any effort in some deluded sense thinking that I
  have much better things to do. 
  
  I still continue to watch a lot of youtube, take up tasks for
  friends, go for dinners everyweek spending quite some time
  
  Its more about procrastination.
  
  
- Until yesterday I didn't know if I had a job or not from next month,
  meaning having to find a job in the next three months, not finding a
  job having mighty consequences.
  
- Yesterday I spent 3 hrs and today another 3 hrs at the library on
  data science. 
  
- I don't knwow how deep I should go if I don't understand anything. I
  just wait for an internal bell to ring to let me knwow if I am doing
  good or not!
	

- For the last 2 months 

- I don't knwo what is good food and what is bad food and yet I see
  myself restricting myself to certain types of food. Feeling guilty
  that I crave them.
  
- Body pain

following a istathuku way of dealing with injuries, not well thougth
out maybe?

For example, I felt the same pain come back?

My back on somedays hurts like a bitch and yet I find myself giving it
the least amount of fucking attention at the end of the day. 

What should I be worried about and what not? Atleast go to a fucking
therapist.?

- I have not idea what to do in cardio, it took me ages to sit and
  find the time to buy a heart rate meter, but now I seek other
  statistics, or the point is the heart rate meter is alone not enough
  
- it's been a while I think I am barely seeing any lifting increases.
  I am soring out at every work out but is that enough, what am I doing wrong, Shouldn't
  I revisit what I am eating and not earing.
  
- I know I can go more times to the gym or save time during weekdays
  and clock more hours of work during the day for real work and yet
  .... and yet here I am going to the gym four times only on
  weekdays. My problem is that not that I going for 4 days, but
  atleast make a tradeoff or try. The internal reason why I think I am
  not going anywhereelse might quite baffle you? I think it is
  something alone the lines of new gym, NOPE. Or maybe one month I'll
  have to spend a few extra euros, just changing gyms with absolutely
  no consequence what so ever to time of travel or closeness to the
  work
  
- The point of persuation is that you have to be so and so or be
  around so and so and yet I crave social intimacy. I "cry" when I
  suck at a social convention. It hurts. Either I understand and move
  on or do something about it, or understand that there are greater
  things to pursue and that is it.
  
- I am behaving like sheldon, I hate change as it influences every
  single thing in my life.I have a set schedule a set way of doing
  things and I would like to stick to it no matter what.
  
- I stopped measureing my fat percentage

- going behind girls

	There is this girl and I keep pursuing her. She sometimes responds
    well, which makes me happy and sometimes not, which makes me
    sad. I suck with girls, but if it is something I should improve at
    then I better do something about it or if it doens't matter then I
    fucking give up
	
- indecisiveness 

	inability to make a fucking decision be it with home, buying a
    fucking computer, buying a heartrate machine, getting a room for
    rent, or paying more and getting shit done
	
	It always comes to the end of the day or the final moment before I
    can make that stupid decision or to a point of complete bullshit
    when I say fuck it lets go! 

- lack of priority
  
- today I am going to go to practice basketball at any cost, even
  though this week I have taken up a mamoth of a task to complete. I
  have also thought it wise to schedule a meeting which will
  most likely move on till the next day.
  
- I waste a lot of time at work, either the job sucks or there is no
  learning or what ever, and yet I have not taken any effort to make
  imporvements to it. Not feeling motivated to make changes.
  
- I am probably going to go back to india in my 60s and I think it
  would be very nice to invest in a sport like badminton as basketball
  is too pricy and farfetched with amassing the number of people
  required to get a good workout rolling. And the number of badminton
  courts are booming like crazy everywhere
  
- having learn't everything about persuation, why don't I apply
  anything? 
  
- procrastination

- At work there are many times when I find myself in a situation where
  I am about to fool myself. Like yesterday, with the filter. Either I
  figure it out or accept that I don't know. But I think I was hiding
  other the implication that the work I do is really straightforward
  and not advanced at all, just flushing a filter anyone can do.

Yes you are right we do judge things based on its impact. Ok then here
  goes, what is the impact of such a thing..
  
- how to gain traction in things that are not clearly defined, like
  writing a blog as opposed to working on say DS course.
  
  The same with applying for jobs! low feedback and high demanding work.

- what is the right decision? how to come to a verdict

	Someone accused me of something, I don't want to accpet it and
  hence engage in drama of a different kind! 
  
- overcoming biases

- accepting things without proper investigation

	what is proper investigation
	
	Reading about things by an STM and just accepting them?  Like
		what? Persuation? are you telling me that the points were not
		convincing?
- inability to think in a structured manner to solve problems


- engaging in drama

	despite knowing I don't want to be engaged in it!

  P.S
  
  I started and stopped after 18 mins as this was hard and middle of
  the day for hard work! I don't like this! I usually sleep in the
  library in the middle of the day, not at work, but only at the library.
