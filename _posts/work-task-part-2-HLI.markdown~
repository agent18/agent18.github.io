## Work task: Volunteer application for HLIâ€™s mental health program evaluation project

**Goal**: How sure are you that improvement in the study group is due to
SbS.

**Interested Claim**: Step by Step (e-intervention, minimally guided
health intervention) reduces depression in low-income countries.

**Example**: Data in the [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7034323/).

**Criticism**:

- This is a study where units are not selected at random (inferences to
  populations of low-income countries (etc.) of people with depression cannot
  be made) 

- There is no control group (Causation being SbS cannot be inferred)

- Potential for a "lot" of systematic bias. This study,  

	- has 77% females
	- is pertaining to people in Lebanon mostly (89%)
	- is about people with education level of more than 18+ years (91%)
	- has people who are mostly (66%) never married
	- possibly has people with high motivation (explained later)
	- has people mainly recruited from cites such as MOPH's Facebook
      page, and Whatsapp of Beirut University and through 7 PHCC's
      across country of Lebanon. Unsure of other effects but can
      imagine that people "actively looking for help" are the ones who
      this intervention reached.

- Confounding variables could be anything such as Natural recovery (over time), or even seasonal changes or whatever. We don't know.
	
- High attrition as noted by the author himself 

	- 129 people were recruited (200 was the goal)
	- 74 (57%) completed session 1 after pre-test questionnaire
	- 35 (27%) completed 80% of the intervention
	- 26 (20%) completed both baseline and post-intervention survey
	- 11 participants in the study did the process evaluation
      interview where 4 had dropped out.
	- Very high attrition rate (80%) compared to often seen values of
      33% or even the 'e-mental health for depression among Turkish
      Migrants in Netherlands' @ 62%.
	  
	Might suggest that this might be for say people with "higher
    motivation". The feedback from the 11 participants also seemed to
    suggest things along these lines.
	
- Long term effects are not known from this study. 
 
- Academics, health staff and NGOs and others seem to have signed up
  in the beginning. This could skew some of the results (which
  compares with the initial set of people who did not continue). For
  example, there is the comparison of the mental health scores of the
  final 26 people and the initial set of people and their PHQ-8
  scores.

**Pros**

- Among the final population (26 people who are young, female etc...)
  they considered, there is a strong suggestion of depression symptoms
  improving due to the intervention "indicating causation".
  
  - PHQ-8 scores p-value <0.001 (pre and post intervention)
  - Average Reduction in mean PHQ-8 scores with every intervention session
  - Wilcoxon signed ranks tests showed significant difference with baseline and post.

- Although the attrition rate is high, PHQ-8 score at
  pre-intervention for the 26 completers and the people who signed
  up but did not complete, is found to be statistically
  insignificant. This seems to suggest that the 26 completers
  seemed to be in "same ball park mental health" as the final 26 before
  they started the intervention.

- First study (right step in the right direction)

- Got lots of feedback for improvement (to improve the way
  intervention was done) from 11 participants. 
  
- Seemingly very little imputation (1.4% of post-intervention
  answers).

- Effect size, very rough (over-)estimation is done and comparable to
  that in high-income settings (0.98). (*I can't comment more. I would
  need to spend some time to understand it.*)

- More work is being done in 2019 and 2020 based on the feedback,
  trying to include other nationalities and to reduce attrition rates.

**Additional things unanswered due to lack of time**

- t-statistics assumptions validity

- If PHQ-8 and other chosen methods are "std. tests" for Mental-Health

- It appears that it does not distinguish between participants who
  used the tablets in the private rooms in PHCCs, and the ones who did
  not.
  
- Effect sizes needs better understanding

**Conclusion**:

The high attrition rate and the systematic biases along with the
confounding variables are not convincing enough for me to believe the
claim that "Step by Step (e-intervention, minimally guided health
intervention) reduces depression in low-income countries."
