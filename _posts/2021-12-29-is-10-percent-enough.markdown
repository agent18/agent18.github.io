## 4 tings

1. Earnings
2. % of earnings
3. feeling of garbage (are you a robot), guilt
4. Motivation for rest of life

5. social benifit

What about burn out

Shelling point

other things to address: For so long I have derived a great deal of
loftyness (feeling of superiority) as a result of being those guys who
can make the decision no one else can make

Nobody is perfect everything is commensurable

Even Batman wants something steady


Feels like shit? oh wait I am supposed to have hobbies now? I was
really counting on living after the singularity? but I am afraid that
might not be the case owing to not being an ajith in the USA



## things to write about

I feel like "vaaku kuduthutain velu", I feel gross saying that I am
going to do just 10%. And plus hello guru, it's me pandian pan indian,
and there are people like me who can do more.

Part of me feels like I have acted like that person, who was going to
do more, and now it is really hard to back vaangradhu!

I suspect I was lookin gat it like a trophy I was going to acheive
soon where in people are going to be amazed. 10% doesn't sound
amazing. 100k$ that sounds amazing. In essense part of the hurt of the
destroyed reality is probably about this, that I can't be that guy, I
am not "much" better than them, however doing 10% is much much more
what the regular paper warriors on twitter etc., are doing. 

I think this was my chance to be superior, and hurts that it is really
sustainable, perhaps.

how about doing more, without telling anyone? how about doing 30%, ot
pledgin 10% for rest of life but pushing towards 30% or even 15% to
begin with. Even with my expensive lifestyle at Netherlands I was able
to afford this, with Data Science salary, hopefully big tech I should
be able to do more? note the point without feeling guilty.

## How much ever you do seems not good enough

Shindler was a nazi himself and somehow he decided to do good and
ended up freeing 1100 jews. He could have done more (as he realizes
himself).

"There will be generations because of what you did". But he felt it
was not enough. I agree. How can you stop, how can you face those
people and tell them "my nigga I had to buy an expensive car", "my
nigga I want to go on a vacation"?

Jeff Kaufman and his wife Julia have pledged 30% of their income and
continue to however do [~50% for the last 8 years](https://www.jefftk.com/donations). Wow, but could
they do more? Certainly. Consider how selfish he is by saying the
following, regarding the constraints for him to find a new job.

45hrs per week, Man GTFO. In addition he does things like this: Has 2
kids, a wife, a mortgage, and plays the banjo guitar at his local
community (nothing fancy, but more hobby). I don't get it man,
shouldn't he be grinding?

Whether it hurt his chances to earn more or not, doesn't matter, but
how about learning to live for others, taking a bit of
discomfort. Maybe if he did 60hrs a week, he could earn more?

---

JK however uniquely acknowledges that he might not be able to do 50%
for the rest of his life, depending on the software salaries that end
up changing things.

How can JK be so selfish?

Really a bit more of your time, valikudha? Why so selfish.

I went to an EA group in holland once and the guy who was running the
show said he gave 10%, I was like bro common (in my head)

--- 

I spend tons of money buying food. I stopped cooking and enjoy
delicious food outside with 7$ meals and shit. I don't think I will
ever stop. My excuse is that this allows me to be free and focus my
time on other things like "becoming better", and working towards the
"great future". But surely there is scope to cut down on expenses and
give it away instead. The number of times I have orderd a 17 dollar
biriyani "celebrating" things like spending 40hrs, I could given those
away. Wait am also selfish!


**Am I one of them?**

For far too long I have ridiculed people in my head who didn't want to
do a lot. Like the masters student who was like he wanted to buy a
ferrari jeezus velangidum. My parents who talk about giving 50 dollars
as loan to the maids or the 100 `$` that a freind was so proud that he
gave away or the 1 `$` pepsi and pizza that my brother gave to someone
because he felt generous.


I have allowed myself so many luxuries in the name of it helping me to
focus on the important things in life like "grinding and make more
money", but for sure I can do more. But it's hard. How much more
should you go further/

## How much to give?

"As much as you can"

1. Earnings
2. % of earnings
3. feeling of garbage (are you a robot), guilt
4. Motivation for rest of life

What do you think?

They are all saying lets "stop" at some point in a way that we are
sustainably able to continue these "activities". So did an STM.

## 10% giving

I mean I am not going to articulate it any better. 

Its a standard decreed by EA. The power of 10% is too much (it can
cure world hunger in a year and more). It's much better than all those
people doing nothing.

It "seems sustainable", most importantly. It's 10% and should be easy
and people like me can continue to enjoy a lavish lifestyle involving
a lot of peace in the form of great food everyday, an independent
house and freedom to travel (to meet friends and family) where ever
once a year.

Let's acknowledge that is it a arbitrary and that there are no
calculations made to show why 10% is what gives us the , just like why
9-5 is how much Julia Wise should work at the psychiatric ward. Why
not 9-5:15? or 9:5:30... You commit to something agreed and stick to
it, commit to something sustainable,

After all, even Batman didn't want to do this for the rest of his
life. He also wanted Harvey to take over.

## Why not do more?

I guess I can certainly do more, but we'll see, is it going to be
sustainable. Let's stick to 10% and lets' take it from there. 

Just like even Kaufman did, take it easy, take it one time at a year. 


For far too long I have romanticized the idea of grinders. Grind
being the only lifestyle that I respect. Being great and giving away
as much as possible.


I treat them as trash. And I have the feeling that I am about to be
one of them. :(
ppp


## 10 % is not just for giving pnn

But you can be great can't you?

Now what do I do with all my time?

Money buying you peace?



## What about aiming high romanticizing life
## It feels sad for a bit (its a new paradigm)

It feels cruel to say to stop with 10%, or leave home at 5pm cause you
have to catch the bus. 

But Shindler, there are 1100 families. Think about their
generations. EA thinks its good enough. Maybe I can do more. Maybe.

(what about not aiming for higher? and hence not doing it? why not try
to identify how much to donate? What about greatness? Why can't we
achieve it? Why is it hard to work on skills at jobs?)

For so long I was craving that day when I would hit that 100k mark
(when I would announce to the world) "I am batman" or whatever. 

For so long I felt I was much better than these lame people who can't
control their feelings

It hurt to see that I am not going to be that JK material. I assumed I
could be. May I still can, but ...


As an STM said, I have written off the 10%, but I am yet to reap it's
benefits. 

Cheer the 10%ers

For some reason I assumed infinite mathivanan, I was going to figure
it out eventually, even though right now and through history I have
struggled to keep the grind alive. 

I have hated myself for always failing. But I am only human after all

## re-write

**How much to give**

"as much as you can" 

What the fuck does that even mean? is this as much as you can?

Is 10% as much as you can? hell no... You should keep striving towards
higher and higher. 

You think you can keep up with this shit then?

But "as much as you can" is never enough

You need to keep outdoing yourself everyyear? 

One thing I tell you 10 % is not enough.

But what about sustainability? are you going to be able to sustain
this forever? what if you burn out? What if you have nothing to look
forward to?

Just 2 months of grind grind grind everyweek, was hard, to keep going
despite feeling like shit. Can you really keep doing 50%?

or for that matter

How will you feel motivated to keep working when say all of your
excess is supposed to be given off.

You can work towards increasing


You might feel like garbage

**How much could be good enough**

**Giving 10% articulated well**

**Proposal to do more like Jk**

**But what about the rest**

## archive




Anyone who is earning a non-student salary who donates <10% is
garbage. a friend of mine once came and told (in a way of receiving
applause), that he gave 100$ that his company had allocated to him for
new year. He was so proud of that, and I was like whatever. My mom
comes to me and says she gave a loan of 50$ to my maid and wants a pat
on her back. GTFO. Do more you can, you are rich!

This standard holds for me as well. 10% good (not great), and then
anything below trash. Grow up. If I see a millionare with 5% donations
he can come such my dick.

I am hoping to do "way more than 10%" when I come to the US. If I can
do 10% with NL salary, I should be able to do more. + JK does 50% with
2 kids and his wife who is a social worker (#one-example). How can I
live with myself with donating just 10%. 

The general worry of increasing this to say 50% and committing to
openly is that it is gong to affect perhaps make me feel miserable as
I try to maintain that "really high" limit. 

I think I will be scrutinizing every part of my life and keep
struggling with doing it. 

What if I loose my job? in the US?

What if the DS salaries fall for some reason in the future.

What if i am not able to work for a few years?

What if I am "burned out"? And want to quit my job for a break a
breather? Just remember 2 months of stress of not having a job,
applying getting rejects and meanwhile having to work really hard at
my current job was so hard. Sustaining it for 2 months is hard.

I think the same arguments hold here too.
