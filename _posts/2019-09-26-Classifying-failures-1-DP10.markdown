**Disclaimer:** This post is not cleaned up thoroughly. It is my
attempt to take all the failed cases from [this essay](/dp-subject-predicate-identify-pattern.html) and assort
them here into different patterns so I can work on them: 

## example not matching subject
## no example
### beliefs about right or wrong (24 practiced)

> (Crime)[0] should (not pay)[1], is (very simple common sense)[2].
>
> Claims: Crime should not pay
>
> Definition: checks out I think!

This is a predicate based on his beliefs about what is right and
wrong, not on empirical examples. “Crime does not pay” is a predicate
about the world and it would be false if the average crime led to a
lot of money without imprisonment. “Crime should not pay” can be
skipped for now. (“The Holy B says that crime should not pay” is
testable, though.)

**Pattern**: "is common sense"

### pattern

> X prefers A to B
>
> Many prisoners prefer to do jobs, instead of having to sit in their cells all day
>
> It took me time to realize that this doesn’t have an example in the
> video I was watching

**how to**: find pattern and guess within 3 mins if it has example or
not.

### context dependent

> Claims: crime does not pay
>
> Didn’t know how the example would look keeping the definition in mind

**how to**: A does not B

### Self claims

> (Marriage)[1] is (a social construct where a man marries a
> woman(/man))[2]. (In countries like India)[3] it is (the norm)[4],
> whereas in (European countries)[5] we do have (couples who do not
> marry for a long time)[6] and (have kids even.)[7]

**Claims**: [1] is [2].

**Subject**: [1].

**Predicate**: is [2].

**Example**: -

**Definition**: *I don't understand this "social construct" and am
unable to give example and compare, as a result.*

**Checklist**: not-sure; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running;
none; *no-example*; *failed* (Failed to give example for my own
claim).

**pattern**: my own claims

---

**Claims**: It is not [11] to get [12].

**Subject**: Spending huge amounts of money and time and effort on me.

**Predicate**: is worth for parents despite kids not listening to
them.

**Example**: *I don't have examples for this, mainly because of the
label "worth for parents". I don't understand what it could stand for.*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*self-claim-with-0-ex*; *failed*; *definition-unclear*;  

**Pattern**:  vague predicates(like "worth it" etc...) with own
claims.

**What it should have been:**

**Example**: My parents will waive 46000 euros of my tuition off if
and only if I get married. i.e., only if I listen to them.

checks out!

**Claims**: When there is [6], [7] is unnecessary.

**Subject**: If [6], then [7] 

**Predicate**: is unnecessary.

**Example**: *I don't have an example*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*self-claim-with-0-ex*; *failed*; *no-example*;

*Spending time on other things will leave you with less time for this?
Give one example of a top problem to be solved in the world and how
your addition of problems say by bringing kids into the world is going
to stop you. Atleast you don't have an example. That is clear. Which
is definitely sad.*

**Claims**: [10], struggle with their kids

**Subject**: What [10] do. 

**Predicate**: Struggle with their children.

**Example**: Whenever I see my cousin at a marriage she would be on the tail
of her two kids. She needs people to be behind them all the time. This
is the case with all my cousins.

**Definition**: checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none ;
*self-claim-with-0-ex*; *failed*; *time* 

*I spent quite some time, wondering why I hated kids so much. Not one
repulsive example came to my mind*

*The definition is unclear but that is because I don't remember what I
wanted to say. It is an argument I make to avoid kids in my life. I
keep saying kids are a pain but that's just too broad I guess. I
remember an STM also saying make smaller claims that you can test
right now. Changing a diaper sucks? dealing with fighting children
sucks? or not being able to do anything else in your life sucks*

---

**Claims**: I have [12] in [13].

**Subject**: What I have.

**Predicate**: [12] in [13].

**Example**: *Don't think I can give an example for this.*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*self-claim-with-0-ex*; *failed*; *time* 

*What I am thinking in my mind is when will "no interest" be
satisfied! That is what I am unsure of.*

**What is should have been**:

**Example**: I told my parents I am not going to get married and to
stop looking for a bride for me.

**Definition**: checks out as this shows the lack of interest in
starting a family.

*More than this I dont see the point of dealing with this claim.*

---

**Claims**: I have [14] and that is good enough.

**Subject**: Having [14].

**Predicate**: is good enough.

**Example**: *Don't have an example for it.*

**Definition**: - 

**Checklist**: no; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*definition-unclear*; *failed* ; *self-claim-with-0-ex*; *failed* 

**Pattern**: X is good enough

---

> If you really have not a (better thing to do in life)[1] and choose to
> (“settle down” and marry)[2], good luck bruv.

**Claims**: It's a bad idea to [2], because you have not
anything [1].

**Subject**: The result, if you marry because you have not any [1]

**Predicate**: is a bad idea.

**Example**: *This should have an example I think, but I don't have
one.*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*self-claim-with-0-ex*; *failed* 

**Pattern**: self claims

---

**Claims**: Compared to a married men at 35, unmarried men at 35, have
much less problems at 35.  

**Subject**: Problems married men at 35 have compared to unmarried men
at 35.

**Predicate**: is much less

**Example**: *I have 0 examples.*

**Definition**: - 

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*self-claim-with-0-ex*; *failed*; 

**Pattern**: self-claims

### no idea if has example or not

**Claims**: crime does not pay

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*no-example*; *unsure*;

**Pattern**: A does not B?; crime?; pay?


“Crime does not pay” is a predicate about the world and
it would be false if the average crime led to a lot of money without
imprisonment.

## Claims of the future (27 practiced)

You can't proove something of the future but you can show examples of
confidence for something of the future based on past (aka human
civilization is at risk due to diseases)

### future that have examples:

> There are (many issues)[1] we haven’t been able to look into yet, so
> we expect there are other (high-impact areas we haven’t listed)[3].

**STM**: What made them expect that there are other areas left? If I
don’t like plain Parle G biscuits even after trying many times, I
won’t say that “I expect there are other tasty, plain Parle G biscuits
that we haven’t listed”.

Perhaps they’ve seen an average of 3 out of 10 areas to be promising,
so based on that they expect that maybe 3 out of the remaining 10
would also be good. Or maybe not 3, but at least 1 or 2.

If they had tried a hundred areas and found zero promising ones, they
would not expect too many promising areas in the future.

**Claims**: There are other [3] we have not looked into.

**How to**: Find future statements and practice like a nigger

### future that does not have examples

> Claim: [3] is at stake (because of AI).
>
> Example:
>
> The fate of Gorillas currently depends on the actions of
> humans. They are currently endangered. Similarly the fate of
> humanity may come to depend on the actions of machines than our own.

In other words, we have no concrete example. If they said that
diseases put human civilization at stake, we can point to the Black
Plague, which killed nearly half the people of Western Europe. Or
nukes (Japan). Or asteroids (dinosaurs).

**Pattern**: Future is at stake types subject talks about the future

---

> I see that (my mind)[8] has already been (made up)[9], primarily for
> the reasons, that (I)[10] have (other important things to focus on)[11]
> and I am not ready to invest in something that is (going to bring my

> and (focus on my career)[14]. What ever I need (to do for that)[15], I
> am (ready to do)[16]. 

**Claims**: [8], regarding marriage, is already [9]   
aka "*I am not going to marry ever*".

**Subject**: [8], regarding marriage

**Predicate**: is already [9].

**Example**: *Not possible to come up with example for the future!*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; false; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*no-example*; *almost-failed*

**Pattern**: claims about the future

## IF / missed comparison

### if with missed comparison

> (These areas)[6a] can be (particularly worth pursuing)[7] if you’re
> (especially motivated by one of them)[8].

Your response:

> For [6a] we think of, working in promoting EA as in the above
> example.

> For [8], we think of a personal fit of more than 50%

> For [7], we think of an impact of 5300*50%=2650 lives which is
> better than working a DS job resulting in 530 net people.

But that doesn’t use [8] at all. Why is it particularly worth pursuing
if you are “especially motivated”? The “impact” [7] you pointed out
would seem to be the same if you had [8] or if you didn’t.

I would expect an example where someone who had this magical [8] went
on to have particularly great “impact”. And I suspect that they do not
have that example.

Consider this: You can bowl a particularly high bouncer if you’re 6
feet tall. Showing Bhuvaneshwar Kumar bowling a bouncer is not an
example. You have to show Courtney Walsh bowling a bouncer that is one
foot higher than usual bouncers.

**how to**: find *if* statements and practice like a nigger.

### Given

> Given our take on (the world’s most pressing problems)[1] and the
> (most pressing bottlenecks these issues face)[2], we think the
> following (five broad categories of career)[3] are a good place to
> (start generating ideas)[4] if (you have the flexibility to consider
> a new career path)[5].
>
> Claim: Given [1] and [2], it appears that following [3] is a good place for [4].
>
> Question: Is following [3], a good place for [4]?
>
> I am not sure how to give an example “Given [1] and [2]”?

Another sentence: “Given that we want batsmen who are short and have
curly hair, here are the batsmen we found: Sachin Tendulkar, …”

So, if you sorted the table of “all careers” using the fields “how
pressing is this problem?” and “how pressing is the bottleneck they’re
focusing on?”, then the five top careers are …

Giving an example of Jacques Kallis would be wrong because he isn’t
short and doesn’t have curly hair. Ricky Ponting would be wrong
because he doesn’t have curly hair.

**how to**: 

### hidden comparison 





## because-should-due-to

All causation type statements using because, due-to, do not have
examples. But we can try to give examples for statements where the
"because part" is removed.

> half of your earnings at divorce)[18], Sorry! Not my cup of milk!

**Claims**: I am opposed to 16, 17 because of 18.

Becomes-->

**Claims**: I am opposed to 16,17.

**Claims**: I am opposed to 16, 17.

**Subject**: what I do.

**Predicate**: is opposed to 16 and 17.

**Example**: I tell my parents that I don't want to get married

**Definition**: checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;

### with examples
> (Average (pay is 0.63 <span>$</span>))[1], that means there are (states
> where Prisoners make considerable less )[2]

**Claims**: [1] means [2] exists.

*Hard to establish causality of [1] meaning [2].*

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*because-should-due-to*; *failed*  

**Pattern**: that means

Do not need to establish causality, but just show an example where
Average pay is [1], and [2] is also true.

### with no examples

**Claims**: I am opposed to 16,17 so that 18.

**Subject**: What I do.

**Predicate**: is opposed to 16, so as to 18.

**Example**: *I don't have an example. And I am not sure if I can give
an example*

**Definition**: 

**Checklist**: not-sure; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; if; 
*because-should-due-to*; *failed*; (failed to recognize it)

**Pattern**: ABC so that Z.

### should

**Claims**: Federal Government **should** have stepped in to reduce the
delay in desegregation.

**Checklist**: no; neither;
*because-should-due-to* ; *time*;

**Failure-mode**: *time*

**pattern**: "should" in the text. 

“Crime should not pay” can be skipped for now. (“The Holy B says that
crime should not pay” is testable, though.)

### When X you end up with Y

> When (you put all of this together)[1] you wind up with a scenario where
> (you're not just hurting the people who are incarcerated)[2], (you're
> hurting everyone around them)[3].

**Claims**: When [1], you wind up with [2].

**Subject**: Consequences of [1].

**Predicate**: is [2].

**Example**: One in three families reported going into debt to pay for
phone calls or visitation.

https://ellabakercenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/who-pays.pdf

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; chapter; not-running; if;
~~*example-matching-definition*; *unsure*~~; *because-should-due-to*; *didn't-recognize* 

**Pattern**: When X you end up with Y

Plan is to skip this "causation" and just give an example where bothe
[1] and [2] occur.

### Must

> Claims: Being able to save lives must be very satisfying

**Pattern**: *must*

I don't think it is possible to give an example for must. But we
should try to give an example by substituting it with is. To disprove
it ofcourse, all you need is one example.

> (Being able to save lives)[1] IS (very satisfying)[2]

**Claims**: [1] MUST be [2].

**Subject**: [1].

**Predicate**: must be [2].

**Example**: I donate 4k <span>$</span>, every year to save one
life. 

**Definition**: I don't think the feeling of satisfaction lasts for a
minute even. False.

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*must*; *failed* 

### often

> It is often not the case that (prisoners who fire fight are learning

My answer with and without "often" looks exactly the same. I don’t know
how to give an example for often. I can't try to give an example in
the case of "often", as done below. But what often means is unclear, I
think for now I should just skip it and make an example for the claim
as a result.

**Claims**: It is often that [1] will not get [2].

**Subject**: what [1] will not get.

**Predicate**: [2].

**Example**: California law  bars those with criminal record from
becoming licensed emergency responders.

**Definition**: checks out. People who put out California fires can't
do it once they are released.

**Checklist**: yes; true; often; chapter; not-running; none; *often*;
*failed*

**Pattern**: *often*

> Jail and prisons often get a cut of the proceeds from phone and

**Subject**:  What Jail and prisons get

**Predicate**:  a cut of the proceeds from the phone and video calls.

**Example**: "Securus paid Hodgson’s office (Bristol county) $1.7
million in exchange for an exclusive contract to provide phone
services to inmates. It paid the sheriff’s office a lump sum of
$820,000 to cover 2016 to 2020"

**Definition**: checks out!

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; chapter; not-running; none;

**Claims**: [2] is [3].

**Subject**: [2].

**Predicate**: is [3].

**Example**: Solving the AI control problem

**Definition**: I don't know what the predicate label is trying to say.

**Checklist**: yes; neither;

**Claims**: [1] is [2].

**Subject**: [1].

**Predicate**: [2].

**Example**: *I don't have any examples*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: not-sure; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running;

**Claims**: For me it is important to [13].

**Subject**: Money making

**Predicate**: is important for me

**Example**: I spend majority of my time working a nine to five job in Netherlands.

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;

**Claims**: For me it is important to [14].

**Subject**: Focus on Career

**Predicate**: is important for me.

**Example**: I spend my free time almost everyday working on either CT
or data science, roughly three hours a day after my nine to five job
(plus gym).

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*a-is-important*; *unsure*; (I am not unsure anymore, this is how far I
can go with checking definitions like "important")

**plan**: check with an STM (no need to practice)

**Claims**: What ever is needed for [15], I am [16]

**Subject**: The things needed for my career

**Predicate**: I am ready to do.

**Example**: Plotting my path to the US is needed for my career.

**Definition**: I have not really spoken to anyone within ASML about
opportunities to go to the US. I have heard stories about it. Looks
like example doesn't match the definition.

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
*matching-definition*; *unsure*; *time*  (You need to understand that
these are vague predicates I guess)

**Pattern**: "What is needed for X I am ready to do"

I wont take this seriously. This statement is but an exercise and that
is it. I wrote it in the past and whether it is true or not doesn't
make a difference to me.

**plan**: Skip it.

**Claims**: [1] cannot be [2].

**Subject**: Discussion amongst Democrats

**Predicate**: cannot be intellectual

**Example**: *Very vague labels and hard to give examples for this*

**Definition**: It appears that ten phrases per hour is really slow
and that I need to spend more effort on it to improve.

What it actually should have been:

**Subject**: What marriage will do to your goals

**Predicate**: bring it down

Then I would give an example to the subject and not just say
"Eliezer or Vishvanath Anand".

**how-to**: Getting A is B;

I don't know how the subject and predicate looks without checking...
