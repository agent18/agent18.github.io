Some reflections on the 300 word experiment:

Overall it ws a success because I wrote all days. And I think I will continue like that. But whata was the use. I wrote one meaniggful postm,but on th e the 400 word post itself. I have been spending an aweful lot of time reading and trying to come up with content or rather solve some important problems!

And rememeber measure the means and no the end. Its not how many post you write or even if this 300 word post needs some justice to it. All that matters is you write and solve problems. and learn a fucking lot of R word and acten sie
