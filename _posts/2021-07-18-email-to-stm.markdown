Hi Bro,

I apologize for the late reply. Had some indrews with EA orgs (which
didn't work out in the end). Just wanted to see where I stand at the
moment and saw this as an opportunity to meet people and ask them
about "skills I would need to be an EA researcher". More on this in a
post (in a month).

No worries. Will find someone to mentor me (with the goal being to move
to a "data science" job right?).

I hope so too bro.

I didn't want to get into EA orgs as a data scientist. I was
thinking of becoming a researcher in EA orgs or becoming a Data
scientist and doing Earning-To-Give, as my options.

I think my experience should only reduce the chance of getting a job
as an EA researcher. Because despite "using examples" and "getting
advice from people in the field on what I should do" somehow I didn't
get a job outside my company. As you mention later, identifying the
skills, and getting feedback on the progress is going to be hard.

I guess this is one of those "really hard questions". I really fucked
up with the Data Science app-ing. I asked "people in the field" of
what skills I would need and tried to emulate it. I even found
"examples". But still I didn't get a job outside my company.

This is one of the things I am "struggling" with. I will write a post
on it within the next month. Currently, trying to identify what skills
I need to have get a job in any "EA org" as a researcher. I am
reaching out to people as part of the interviews that I have with
them, to get answers to the question, "what steps I need to take to
become givewell material". I will write a post on EA forum and reach
out to some connections I made through the EA network. I am also
trying apping for assistant positions or internships. I will try to go
to EA global this year in UK.

You are absolutely right. I will write about this aspect in my
upcoming post. Thanks.

In a [blog post from before,](http://agent18.github.io/career-update.html) I have used the following (see image
below) to calculate the lifetime impact of a researcher. Here you can
see "Total amount attributed to researcher as % of co-founder" and
"total amount moved by GIVEWELL" as one of the components. (This is a
GIVEWELL estimate that I found on their site.) I think what you are
saying (about researchers research leading to affecting where donor
donates) is captured here. What do you think?

*Insert picture here*

I feel like you are trying to discourage me from pursuing a path of Research in EA orgs because of 

1. how we estimate the impact (so there are lot of guesses) 
2 . The seeming lack of feedback to practice "EA skills"

STM bro, Are you trying to tell me to drop this EA research "BS" and work on Data Science like a madman considering the concreteness of impact and things we would need to do to get there?
