#### **Story so far**
Until now I have been desparately trying to look at biases to get some clue on what they are actually meant for. I had a look at the wikipedia page on hueristics, and unfortunately I was not able to get any information on what the biases are actually meant for, my goal being to ascertain the true value system. Maybe the places I am looking are not the right places. I tried going through help results for "morality and hueristics" as well. Anyways I am still stuck with the question of what is my true value system.

#### **Another angle**

The following is the argument my friend gave me 2 years back from which I want to see if I can build up. The idea is also similar to the Peter Singers Essay on "Famine, affluence and morality".

Lets say your friend might get shot and it is within your capability to save him, but your favorite ice cream truck comes by. What will you do? 

Would you give up hanging out with your girlfriend? Would you give up sex?

If in the above case even if it was someone unknown would you still go on to save him?

Does it matter if he is 10 feet away from you, if you will save him?

Does it matter if he is 100 feet away from you, if you will still save him?

Does it matter if he is x feet away from you, if you will still save him, merely giving up the ice cream that you are eating?

Does it matter if its a he she or anyone else from any age?

Should you give up buying your flatscreen monitor (considering that the novelty wears off within no time), rather than saving a life? 

The question is how far would you go? Rather, how far should you go?

I think I am back to square one. I don't really have an answer or a direction to go by. 

Further more, what I see is that this is the same thing that happened with Petersingers statements in the purpose of life part 2. The verdict is clear, you either use the same reasoning for everything or you dont. 

In this case you can pretty much start with would you pay a 10000$ to save a life that is about to be shot? I dont know. I am not in that situation. I only feel social pressure to not give 1000$ to save a friends life. Maybe I will give. What if you do not know him?

But not everybody would say the same thing right? I shall continue later. I am also struggling with universality of the argument. For example, I should hear a similar argument from my friend or from a terrorist. My point being that it should be universal. Things to explore max.

##### **Evaluation**

This is too strangling. I am unable to produce proper content. I would like to explore things, but I am unable to as it seems to taake more effort and hence more time to write about it. Plus I need to produce some thing proper, so I almost give up on such tangents. Its 24:00 hrs now, and I have written shit. I would like to take my time and not rush on the posts. Of course I would like to spend more time writing and generating quantity and not like this as this is painful. I want to sleep. This feels like it is never ending and generating content of quality is very hard and you just cant force it I would guess. I spent the last one hr trying to generate 600 words. Its almost impossible, that being the goal. I would like to change the goal and have something that is relaxed and allows me the chance to actually create quality content. This is absolute shit. I dont even feel like analysing this properly. I just want this to end. I am not sure if this is a great way to generate content! With today I have finished the 6 days as "promised". Will plan for something from tomorrow already.
