Past few days I find that for some reason or the other, I don't write as much. For me the one thing I try ot see is, if I am writing or not, and at what continuous pace. 

What is your currnet pace : less than a post a week. In one year there are 52 weeks. I need to solve some critical issues and it seems that 52 posts might not be enough. [citation needed] ook at your history.s

I need to speeden up the process, Some weeks I do absolutely very little with producing content. let alone spending little or no time on writing. and a lot of time on everything other than writing. This is not good. If writing is the only thing that can help me think clearly and solve problems [citation needed], then what am I doing.

Several times over the months I have felt myself slacking, for various reasons, none excusable. I feel like shit, because I suck so bad. 

Now what?

not able to stay motivated what to do?

First need to be worthy of an STM

I will be worthy if I write a post on being frozen, type of choices for work:an initial start,  any full blown topic by next week friday! This is much more than what I usually do! This is my life from now on!

Thsis is not a chore, this is what you need to do. This is your baby, This is your startup! You need to kil bruv!
these 2 days finish 2 essays! who's stopping  you after that!
