## Entry question: Where can we find the solution to what we are supposed to do

## Setting it up


We would like to determine what we are supposed to do in life. But dont have the solution.

~~There is surely a solution~~ **Maybe** there is a solution, just that we dont know it.

We are doing so many things in life, trying to be happy, listening to feelings, feeling sad, trying to make money, friends etc.. So many problems. I am surely interested in a solution to all my problems, but where do I find it.

### What do you mean solution

A solution would be something that tells you how you should go about living your life. Something that answers what we are supposed to do in life. Something that gives the purpose of life.

## The solution in a box

Lets say there is a box it has the ultimate solution to life. Lets also say, I obtained it from the greatest rational people in this world, who believe this is the solution to life. 

Now Open it, read it, and do it.

#### OPEN it read it 

What if it says "watch why this kolaveri again and agian"

What if it says "There is no meaning to life"

What if it says "go kill a baby; that is the solution to your life"

Waht if it says "kill your parents and then kill yourself"

Mind you, it is the ultimate solution. 


#### Do it.

If it is what it is, the ultimate solution, then shouldn't you be doing it?

But can you?

Imagining myself in a forest where there is no one, and knowing for sure that I will not get caught at any cost in the hands of the police, I still cant go ahead with killing the baby. 

What if it is backed by world renouned scientists, rational god men, studies and heavy research. What if scientists claim emperical evidence says that this is it, go kill babies.

Shouldnt you be killing babies by now. Why arent you killing them, even in a forest scenario.

I cant. 

Why not!!!

I just fucking cant. It fucking pains. My feelings bars are beyond full and are not allowing me to go through with it, come what may. Hell, not even if my life were at threatenment. I cannot kill a fucking baby, say taking a knife and stabbing it. GOSH NO.

What about killing your parents?

NOOOOO.

What if I hand you a red pill, a pill that can change you forever such that you can kill babies is the red pill.

NO.

Knowing that your purpose is to kill babies and that the red pill can change your thought process from not killing, to killing right away,
I cant.

## WHY?

Maybe there is more than that which meets the eye.

Some sort of constraint.

It appears that we decided in the end if the solution in the box was acceptable or not. 
The box is not the final adjucator. Its us.

What if kissing girls was the solution in the box. 

YES

What if going to hanging out with friends was the solution in the box.

YES.

What if rubbing a rock to your skin is the ultimate solution?

NO

## Concusion for now:

It appears that the solution is inside the head. 

The solution from outside does not count at all, as we are going to do what we want to do, unless of course it matches with the actual solution.

## Still missing


1. Are there any discrepencies with the above stated points.
1. has the solution changed with time?
2. Taking just one example and proving it wrong ok!! but what about the other examples.
3. Is this universal, can all people not kill babies?
4. value system, feelings, hueristics and biases.

Maybe a rewrite during week 2 or editing during week 2. What say?

Thank You.
