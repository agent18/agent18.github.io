## Follow this video verbatim

	rclone config
	
I ignored all deviations from the video, and it seems good enough.

By pressing 1 gave infinite access to rclone. Maybe there are other
options, like one folder in particular. Should go for that !!!

## Once done (Still in the video)

	rclone listremotes

out:

	GokulDrive:
	GokulDrive-one-folder:
---

	rclone mkdir GokulDrive:rclone-test-folder
	
out: 

Creates in folder in drive! Waaaat!

**Copies files from PC to GokulDrive**

	rclone copy agent18/g-drive/ GokulDrive:rclone-test-folder

**Syncing PC from Gdrive**

	rclone sync GokulDrive:rclone-test-folder agent18/g-drive/
	
This is cool. It actually syncs. :)

**Check Rclone if synced?**

	rclone sync GokulDrive:rclone-test-folder agent18/g-drive/
