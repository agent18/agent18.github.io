Thej,

Sorry for the late reply. Got really busy in June. Congrats on the data analyst job within the company.
Would strongly recommend finding a mentor within the data science field, either from some meetups like you said or some senior person in your company.
Overall, I suspect that the data analyst experience plus personal projects in R, Tableau, etc. should boost your CV a year down the line.
How does your application experience change your estimated chances of getting into EA as a data scientist? Is it still 60% after 4 years? I get the sense that it won't be too different from the success rate for getting an industry job.
You mentioned in your earlier post that the "EA path" involved "building the skills through DP hopefully". Given the twists and turns in the data science app-ing, how sure are you that you know which skills are needed for EA research? Also, as I'd mentioned earlier, the results of "EA practice" seem a lot less tangible than "data science practice". You have a lot of data on the concrete skills data science jobs are looking for. You can confidently work on those and get feedback. Not sure if you have data or feedback like that for EA research.
The weakness of the EA researcher estimates is caused by the fact that each researcher is much farther removed from the impact than a donor. If it were about soliciting donations, an EA employee could talk about the incremental amount raised by the pledge drives that they ran. Whereas a researcher puts up research, which affects recommendations, which then affects where people donate. I don't know of a way around this except to take the stats with a grain of salt (i.e., discount the estimated impact).
