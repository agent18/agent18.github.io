## Introduction

When Harry was asked by the sorting hat in HPMOR(???) as to why he
wanted to be in Ravenclaw so bad, What was the true reason?

I am no prodigy, but I am afraid just like Harry. I am afraid of
ending up a person who gives 5000 euros every year. ORDINARY. This
shall not happen and I need to up my ante. The option I know to some
serious ETG is a DS job in California with TC (total compensations) of
300k with 2yoe and a Masters. I am 29 now and feel like this is it,
before 30 I need to make a choice (baseless). I want to spend time
growing better at something, rather than make changes every few
years. I want to try to be great right! I am not going to be able to
change to a masters when I am 37 but people in other backgrounds (a
doctor from Pakistan) have done it in MIDS as informed by a close
aid. Shifting at 37 seems like a lot at that age (What ever the
fucking fuck that means.). So I would like to see if DS is even an
option or I have been farting all along? What are the chances to a
great ETG? and if I should pursue it in contrast to working in a EAO.

I recently got rejected for a mental health internship. I made it to
the interview and then the test where I got rejected due to "sub-par
research capabilities" (even though I promised to work 20+ hours when
requested 5+). I don't know how long it take to improve "research
skills". What if I am still not able to break into EA? Worst of all,
what if I am able to break in, but the job is highly replaceable and
there are very few positions of "high impact"? The EA movement is
growing like crazy with 200 people apping for 15 positions in the last
year to CE, to >2000 people apping for the roughly 20 positions. So
maybe if I am good with research I might still not be a good fit. 

So there is a lot of uncertainty so let me start trying to see how
things unfold.

## ETG scene

prolties impact

A DS job in Apple with 3yoe can pay 300k<span>$</span> per year
TC. Jeff Kaufman is able to donate 50% of his salary (???) in
Boston. Based on this, I think 150k<span>$</span> is definitely a
possibility for donations after 2 years of say savings. 
 
The thing with DS in US is that I am not a Citizen and that comes with
the thing that I need an H1B Visa and with that comes lot of anxiety,
and uncertainty of pursuing such a job which I will detail out in a
bit. So there seems to be two routes to a DS job, one is through a
Master's and the other seems to be through L1. In the following
subsection, I try to estimate what sort of probabilities are going to
be there. 

### H1B rejections seem to be random

The H1B visa is a lottery system and has a cap on the number of people
it will give the visa to. Roughly 230k people apply and 85k people are
selected on a lottery system. After you are selected in the lottery,
based on some method, you are either approved or rejected or requested
for an [RFE](https://goh1b.com/en/blog/2019/07/02/what-does-h1b-rfe-mean-most-common-reasons/). The cases for denial of this RFE have become "much
higher" [(33% in 2019 from 10% in 2016)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2019/08/08/latest-uscis-data-show-increase-in-denials-for-new-h-1b-visas/#5443e3417cc4) over the trump era and one
of the things they seem to be scrutinizing the people for not having
the **right background/experience for the work** they are doing. This
comes under "Beneficiary qualifications". Another common issue seen is
called "Speciality Occupation". The **position needs to qualify as a
speciality occupation**. Apparently[ USCIS does not usually think a
job is "special enough", if they don't seem to have the need of
relevant bachelor's](https://ogletree.com/insights/uscis-issues-top-10-reasons-for-h-1b-requests-for-evidence/). So a Bachelor's or its equivalent in a
particular speciality. If you look on [trackitt](https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/h1b), you do see that
"most" of the rejects are cited based on this "Specialty Occupation"
or "lack of relevant degree" (Beneficiary qualifications I
presume). In some cases they have been plain mean, by rejecting H1B's
directly without RFE even. Apparently [this guy (Amazon L6 SDE)](https://www.teamblind.com/post/H1b-extension-rejections-for-FAANG-Senior-software-engineers8-yoe-t5obBBbF)
was rejected despite his 10+ years of experience, maybe because of
non-CS background in India, despite having a "very special job" (that
paid him 320k TC). They send RFEs to people with over half a million
dollars of salary for "speciality occupation". Naturally this scares
me.

My Bachelor's and Master's are currently in Mechanical. Considering
the nature of the RFE's these seem like a prime suspect for an RFE. I
know cases of people with Bachelor's and Master's in Mechanical who
have made it to software job after their RFEs
([ronaldo7!](https://www.teamblind.com/post/6mTKzvNm),[tiger12](https://www.teamblind.com/post/H1B-RFE-Data-Scientist-III-PqF7wkMk)). And then there are people with Master's
in Financial Mathematics who are unable to get in after their RFE to a
CS/DS job ([9mineHwang](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Im-a-data-scientist-and-I-got-a-H1B-RFE-again-UvhDqaXm)). This is from a Hiring manager at Amazon
explaining what a giant cluster fuck of a mess it is: "One of my
report’s visa was rejected saying the job is not a specialty
occupation and doesn’t need bachelors degree which is ridiculous as
why would Amazon pay that person $300K per year for a non-specialty
job.  The decision on visa application has become so arbitrary that
the outcome is not known.  One employee has one application rejected
and the same application was approved the second time."---[hiring
manager Amazon](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Immigration-Mess-sAYGCXgg). 

So it turns out that there is no clear pattern with masters or
yoe. But because the rejections are based on "speciality occupation"
and "relevant degree", I am still going to side with doing a masters
in DS atleast and having yoe, but am not worried that all along I was
in MechE earlier and that it is going to affect me.

There could be other reasons for the rejections seen like, random
factors, officer who does your process, whether it is a transfer or
extension process, job code, lawyers, RFE explanations, IT companies
worked with in the past, history of working with consultancies
etc... But atleast there are a few cases where Mech degree seems to
still be fine to move into CS. And the rest seem to be beyond my
control and the best you can do is give your best and leave it at
that. So I guess I would use the p(RFE rejection rates for these
beyond my control events). Perfect.

### Probabilities

So ultimately we want a FAANG job in the coming years.

The probability of getting a FAANG job seems to be:

1. P(getting H1B lottery in any of the attempts): 80%

	A person on a STEM OPT can apply 3 times on H1B lottery over three
    different years ([Answer by Carlos Cueva](https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-an-F-1-student-can-apply-for-H1B-visa#)). The probability of
    getting in the advanced category (masters and above) in [one of
    the three attempts, seems to be 80%](https://bintlr.work/h1bProbabilityEstimate.html). The probability of
    getting selected in the common pool is 65% in any one of the three
    attempts. Corresponding one attempt values are 41.9% and 30.1%
    respectively. This assumes a [50% split between general pool and
    advanced pool](https://www.happyschools.com/h1b-visa-2020-probability-lottery/). Personally these numbers look plausible to me
    as anecdotaly, I know only 2 people (with master's) who didn't get
    H1B in all their attempts and I know 15-20 people who made it and
    are in good jobs, now with their H1B scene sorted (mostly before
    trump era).
	
	Note: Some companies do not hire you in your OPT if you don't have
    [atleast 2 attempts](https://www.teamblind.com/post/FAANG-that-accepts-candidate-with-less-than-24-month-OPT-46DqLqvB). Also there is a possibility of applying
    with many H1B sponsors for the same year with different
    employers. So lets assume I have 3 tries for now.
	
2. P(getting approved after clearing the H1B): 62.7%

	[According to Fragoman](https://www.fragomen.com/insights/alerts/latest-uscis-data-confirm-continued-high-rates-nonimmigrant-rfes-and-denials-fy-2019), 84% of the people get approved (in the
    end) after being selected in the lottery. 39.6% get an RFE and
    62.7% of that get approval. In my case I am going to assume that
    for sure I get an RFE as I am not like "a perfect CS bachelor's CS
    Master's and high paying CS job guy".
	
	This means that the probability of getting approved after clearing
    the H1B is 62.7% (all hail Trump era).
	
3. P(of doing well enough in masters and landing a job in US based on
   skills) = 85% (guess)

	I have seen cases "similar to mine" who after 2 years of intense
    work-ex in India did a masters and without any qualms landed a job
    in Apple and Walmart. I assume the chances are pretty good as I am
    going to work my ass off "like them". Also I barely know of cases
    who had to leave the country once they went there. So people who
    leave to the US seem to be managing to hang in there (pre-trump
    era atleast). 
	
3. P(finding an L1able or other routes and finding sponsor for H1B) =
   60%-80% (guess)

	Finding and getting L1/direct-H1B opportunity. I know cases of
	people doing this route. People who are probably "very good" in
	their field. People in finance with and without an MBA (from
	India) now in New York in Investment Banking (after 2 years in
	banking or 4yoe). People with Metalurgy back ground who moved to
	US after 3 years of software job in India and now with 7yoe found
	a 3 H1B sponsors for this year. and other cases where people were
	"so good" that they demanded an L1 right at the entry of the job
	for one year later. So being good is enough. And I think I can get
	there with a 60-80% confidence. 
	
	How to do it is something that I can still invest in...
	
	Regarding if I need to do a masters or not, I would like more
    examples of people who have done it without a masters and pursued
    the L1 route. Currently that is the only thing that will convince
    me I guess. I have time to get such info. I could always figure
    out a way to do part-time masters here or after I am on L1 before
    the H1B.
	
	Apparently it is possible that your L1 applications could also be
    rejected. I have no idea of the probability. But I am not
    estimating it and don't have not known of cases. The company I
    work for seems to be able to send people at will to San Jose at
    will. So not too worried.
	
4. P(recession !ending my H1B career altogether while apping) = 90%
   (based on the last 20 yearsish)
   
   My friends seem to have the opportunity to come back on an L1 after
   working 1 year. I think the thing to focus on again seems to be to
   be really great at what you are doing to improve your chances. But
   loosing everything you tried to achieve and being in anxiety of
   that "all your life", seems a bit much. 
   
   There are other probabilities such as keeping the job, not being
   laid off in the next recession etc... which is also weak. Assuming
   I am not going to marry, it fully depends on me to keep my
   chances. not sure how to evaluate it. For now focus on being great
   so that you are one of them people who can manage.   
   
5. Total P(getting a FAANG job in the Masters route) =
   80%x62.7%x85%x90% = 38.3%.
   
   Common man! freaking 38.3 poucent
   
6. Total P(getting a FAANG in the L1 route) = 80%x62.7%x(60)%x90% = 27% 

	Jesus man! what kind of probabilities are these? Unfortunately
    this is what it is. If I can do an average of 150k donations
    every-year that will be insane but with such probabilities is
    about 57k. Fuck me.! 
	
	A data engineer with a Masters in Us and 2 years experience abck
    in india is able to already get 300kTC. I mean the money is
    insane, if there is ever hope of hitting half a million dollars I
    think it can be done, here. This gives massive donation potential.

FUCK!


In the end (?)

### EA scene 

prolties, use what my internship recent one.  impact

**Fit**  

I think the entry jobs I could train towards in the EA scene are
Generalist Researcher (OPP), Data Scientist (Khan Academy), RCT
designer (AJLPAL), Statistics related (GiveWell) research, writing out
the research, explaining the research or even Charity Entrepreneurship
(CE). This type of work in all fields including longtermism, global
health and poverty, and AEA. By no means am I suggesting I am there
yet, but these are things I have done in the past and see "paths to
them where I can get better".

Why not other options? I could theoretically do fundraising (as in
start at basics and get further), but I don't know a path to it. In
any case I have already spent some time on the list above and it might
be worthwhile to pursue something I have "experience" in (Why? Why
not!).

I could choose other options based on dearth of people But... there
seems to be no indication of the sorts of people that are in dearth
other than in Disentanglement Research and AI Policy and perhaps
higher up positions in EAOs (owing to my article on TC). All three of
which I don't think I can get into at Entry either because of not
being in the US or lack of citizenship or not setup for such research
etc...

Not only the dearth, but I could also look at replaceability, and all
the jobs I know of or where I have stats (confirmation bias) appears
to be having plenty of people to choose from. For example the OPP
hiring round with 100s of "good CVs" or the CE Entrepreneurship for 20
people out of >2000 applications. I GUESS that replaceability in such
jobs COULD BE high (90-95%) based on information from "EA Global
health people" I had an informal chat with. One even exclaimed that
the chosen one for the job and the guy who just missed the job seemed
almost identical for a research position. So the dearth of people in
these jobs like researcher seems low. And the only way to really make
a difference is to be much better than your next candidate.

So now it is down to being much better in a particular job than the
last candidate w.r.t EA jobs being the factor which I need to use.

Doing things like higher positions like Research Manager seems to be a
stepping stone from researcher (which seems to be the entry) as I have
seen with a couple of people from AJLPAL.

**Prolties**

It's not looking good now. I recently applied to CE for an
internship. I was able to get in through the interview and failed at
the exam. I was "informed" that the research I had done on mental
health was not upto par. So there is for sure work to be done to
improve.

Another thing is vacancies. Open Phil hired 5 people in 2018 for
generalist research. 2017 seems to be 0. [2019 they will hire
"discreetly" without publicly announcing](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-progress-2018-and-plans-2019#Plans_for_2019). What fun!

https://www.givewell.org/print/about/progress: GiveWell is even more
discrete. 2019 3-5 staff in all levels of seniority. [2018 doens't
look like any.](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/15/review-of-givewells-work-in-2018/). [2016 and 2017 also seem dry](https://blog.givewell.org/2017/03/30/givewell-as-an-organization-progress-in-2016-and-plans-for-2017/).

So I would go on to say, they are growing slowly and there seem to be
a lot of people (17 people (people who made it to the final round of
Open Phil 2018 round)) who would still be useful. Nevertheless where
are the vacancies. A quick look at the board for the last 8 weeks
shows: The [job board](https://80000hours.org/job-board/?role-type=research) seems to boast 10 opportunities over the last 4
weeks all over the world. So unsure how to say if there are many
vacancies or not, but they seem to fill up without me. And they are so underpaid. 

And the salary is insanely low (48k). WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT? CGD
Washington 


For sure I need to up my ante (with some sort of data analysis/
analytics/global poverty thingy) only then I can know. I can also see
what I would need for such a job, for example looking at Linkedin what
they do. Or I find someone similar to me and ask them how long it took
them. Maybe someone on EA forum.  But for now I aint good.

How long before I get there? not sure. I would expect something like 6
months to finish courses and then jump into real stuff. 

When I will know true prolties
is if I see who got that job and what are the qolifications

**Conservative Impact Estimate**

Let's assume the case where three orgs are involved Donors (Cari and
Dustin), Middlemen (GiveWell, OPP) and the auctioneers (AMF). Based on
discussions by [Joey](https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/fnBnEiwged7y5vQFf/triple-counting-impact-in-ea?hide-nav-bars=true) and [Peter's comment on Shapley Value](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EP8x3vHRQJP57TjFL/the-counterfactual-impact-of-agents-acting-in-concert?commentId=K9NWTwrPEvrb4iGJe), in
an attempt to avoid double counting, I assign equal percentage of
impact to all (for lack of a better way). This means that the
middleman gets 30% of impact. 

Replaceability of the organization is another thing that reduces
actual impact. So if the Donors didn't know about OPP they would
probably end up giving to someone else with lesser impact. [Benji
todd](https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/fnBnEiwged7y5vQFf/triple-counting-impact-in-ea?hide-nav-bars=true) suggests that he takes less than 30% of the impact in his
case. We use the same value.

Replaceability of the actual person within the organization, based on
my feedback and informal talks with some people in the EA global
health and poverty scene I come to 10% impact over the next
candidate. Owing to the large amount of competition (2k people for 20
positions in CE) I am inclined to assume [level 1 type thinking as
explained by Peter](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC) (also check the 2019 ea survey for more info on
EA underemployment?) in this conservative estimate. So I will have
only 10% impact of the job and not more than that. In this case I am
almost saying the guy behind me is contributing very little in the
real world like 5k or so per year. 


So there is one estimate of the type of impact one can have while
working on an EA. A beginner researcher in his first year is able to
contribute to 10% of co-founder value and there are 9 co-founder
equivalents in GiveWell. GiveWell tracked 110m in 2015. This leads to
an impact of `0.1x110m/9`=`1.2m`. Let's assume in the coming years it
gets better and you reach 30% on average over your lifetime. This
leads to `3.6m`. Now taking into account the factors above (last three
paras), we get `3.6mx0.3x0.3x0.1 = 32,400$` Wow. But note that this
number is insanely sensitive to certain factors. If replaceability is
doubled to 0.2 then we get `64,800$`. The "way-better" you are the
better. This is conservativeish I think.

A donation more than `32,400$` seems to be better than the EA route
for me. 

Other unofficial estimates 3-10x the salary (usually 80khours`$`) from
orgs in global health and AI research without including
replaceability. Including replaceability we get to similar order of
magnitude. And I am not sure about how they disperse the impact
between different organizations donors etc...

so now am thinking what different EA has if I exist or die. its the
difference in replaceability.

## What to pursue L1 or Masters

Based on impact, savings, back-up plans, anxiety, probability, debt

Considering the probability for Masters and L1, I prefer L1. I can put
extra effort into it. I don't want to do a masters exclusively
considering I could be in debt of 72k`$` especially with that bad
probability. 


Assuming savings wont be an issue because people survive with such
salaries. Maybe I need to prepare for contingencies if I work at an
EAO. But assuming it is not the case. 

Impact is a big question in EAOs. Getting a job is a big question at
EAOs (there are factors such as vacancies, being able to take up the
job)

Nevertheless I see no reason not to pursue serious data science maybe
from that facebook post. Whether it needs to be in EAO or L1 we'll
figure it out later. Meanwhile I continue concrete thinking in
parallel. This is it. This is my plan. Plus I need some time before I
get my citizenship in netherlands so that I can use it as a fall back
option. 




Earnings

Retirement

Need for back up plans

Impact 

I would say stop this... Work go to US somehow.. work hard. get some
money and then see what the plans are? At 40 you can move to these
type of work. you will have experience etc...

You have to start somewhere. You can grow into bigger positions: look
at AJLPAL people and all seem to have moved from a research position
to higher. 

Jumping into a DS job, prepping for it. so that I can keep ETG open
for me. Meanwhile I get better in statistics, writing, economics,
poverty stuff etc...

Just write it up. and then identify claims... I am very skeptical
about spending time on DS. I don't care about what people think. I
want to try out something like working on my research skills.

Do we need to keep ETG on the side? What if I don't get a job? that is
why i think i need to have my foot in both places. If EA is not workin
gout hten I better get the fuck out of here to US. Become "great" in
DS. bro. Let's go.

But of course, if you look at Luke prog, eliezer, they don't have
backup plans, they are just stunningly good I would guess. They odn't
need another job. Another job needs them. there are so many people who
are taking the chance. 

### Biggest fear

### Planning Fallacy


### Other claims to investigate

It is possible to grow to bigger positions... e.g., I have.

People start in research and move to other positions. e.g.,... I have

Research/interns are the only things I can do? in Longtermism and
Global poverty

Program managers can be grown into as well.

Figure out if I have to take the Micro economics course data analysis
for social scientists and designing and running randomized
evaluations. ( This week starts on Jun2 2020. **Important**)
