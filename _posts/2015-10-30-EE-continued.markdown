[EE E]:http://agent18.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/10/29/Emperical-Evidence%20.html
[MVT]:http://agent18.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/10/08/Map-vs-territory.html

## Setting it up

We know from the post [Map vs Territory][MVT], that the Map != Territory. And in the post on 'Emperical Evidence (Edited)' we dicussed that we can use EE to make our map closer to the territory. We discussed some examples of this EE, namely, references to journals in a website, and scientific journals themselves. As a continuation we should try to see what all is not emperical, how we fall for it in daily life and what we can do to make life more EE based.

Also, what do we do when we do not have journals to quote from. Say you want to find out which topic to choose for your master thesis or which univerity is 'better' to make maximum money, what do you do? As I write this I realise, that I dont really know what all is emperical. Other than science journals I got nothing. So, What are we waiting for? Let the games begin!!!

But first, a tiny recap on EE. Objective information obtained usually through observations and experiments is considered as EE. The findings of the observations and experiments should be [replicable][EE E]. As Map !=Territory, we need EE to tell us more about the territory.

## What do things Non-emperical look like? 


We need falsifiable hypotheses. An example of a falsifiable statement is this: "it will rain today from 7 to 8 pm". It if doesnt rain between 7 to 8, then the statement is false. An example of non falsifiable statement is this: "it will rain today from 7 to 8 pm, but then again it might not rain today from 7 to 8 pm".

There is no way of proving such things as false. In our interest of seeking the truth we would like to deal with only falsifiable statements. As it is possible to test and throw out what all beleifs are junk. 

The only way to know if the hypothesis is actually true is by measuring its impact or in other words cheking how good is its prediction power is. For example, many people talk highly of 'Robin Sharmas- the monk who sold his ferrari'. Robin sharma wrote a novel that was intended to also be a teacher on how to lead life. The Hypothesis here is Robin sharmas propsed purpose of life. 

How is the impact measured here. The book boasts a number of awesome testimonials, such as, "It is an elegant and powerful formula for true success and happiness.". So it must be true. Is this Emperical?

The reviews are showering praises for this book. Is this Emperical? Lets take this for example, its from a synopsis I found online. A guy recommends reading that book and says he was inspired but couldn't impliment what the author said as it was a lot of things and makes life cumbersome, and still recommends it. In lay mans terms, something whose impact appears to be nice according to the reviewer, but has had no idea of the impact what so ever, recommends this book saying it was inspirational and 'insert other words that fool people in general here'.
