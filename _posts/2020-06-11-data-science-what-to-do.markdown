Statistical Sleuth book I have

## Ofir Reich

> Before you dive into ML! I'd say basic statistics and its relation
> to daily life is very important.  Probability - know a few basic
> distributions and real-life examples. Learn to intuitively classify
> examples to the appropriate distribution.  Numeracy - Learn to focus
> on the right quantities/outcomes for a problem.  Statistics - the
> basics. False positives, false negatives, setting a threshold,
> tradeoffs. Estimation, noise, fooled by randomness.  I also think
> some data visualization skills are important. Specific packages
> (matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh etc.) you can learn online - but for the
> theory I highly recommend Tufte's "The visual display of
> quantitative information".


## Jacques Thibo

> Intro to ML: https://course18.fast.ai/ml  
> Deep Learning for Coders: https://course.fast.ai/index.html  
> For ML, nothing else compares, imo. Completely free with a big
> community on the forums! You can learn pandas/numpy while doing
> those courses as well (Start taking the course and look up stuff
> about Pandas as it comes up). The 2020 version of Deep Learning for
> Coders is coming online soon, so look out for that. I know that Iâ€™ll
> be taking it (again).

## Target 3 months

I want to pick up a statistics course and a DS course and an ML
course. Mainly do examples and see how that goes.


## Exercises

Data Camp
Kaggle
http://datasciencemasters.org/ 

https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview


## So far

I have an fb post coming with some examples of what people did...

https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-went-from-zero-coding-skills-to-data-scientist-in-6-months-c2207b65f2f3

Based on the above, Statistics, experiment design, scientific method
expertise

SQL data analysis course etc... 

### Ideally
**starting at kaggle**

for ML... and do exams. as and when necessarey learn from fast.ai

**Peter suggested Pythiath course:**
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/?fbclid=IwAR0a-S06xLRHlFWkCndGe8sjrTMgbAJbteL9HNlcyzmX9azcod-Bzo53KLI

**Statistics course**
Finish Khan Academy Statistics and Probability. 

https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-learning NOT SURE ABUOT THIS!

Do some course...



**ML course**

fast.ai
kaggle
DATACAMP

**DS course**


**SQL course**


I would like to do the MIT course, Statistics course, follow it up
with heavy KAGGLE for ML (more info on fast.ai) and statistics as
needed.. More problems on data camp
