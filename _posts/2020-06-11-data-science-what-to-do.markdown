Statistical Sleuth book I have

I am considering doing some courses from Poverty Action Lab such as Data Science for Social Scientists, Microeconomics, and the challenges to Global Poverty. Is it a good place to start?"

Sounds good to me!

### Anjan Gantapara

Example did coursera machine learning course after his phd in
computational stuff to get to a job in DS. Seems knowledgeable in
statistics after which Philips hired him.

"I employed advanced Statistical Mechanics concepts and modern Monte
Carlo techniques to simulate micro- and nano-meter size anisotropic
particles and elucidate their phase behavior as a function of various
macroscopic controllable parameters."

### Exercises

Data Camp
Kaggle
http://datasciencemasters.org/ 

https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview


### So far

I have an fb post coming with some examples of what people did...

https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-went-from-zero-coding-skills-to-data-scientist-in-6-months-c2207b65f2f3

It takes 6 months...

Based on the above, Statistics, experiment design, scientific method
expertise

SQL data analysis course etc...

## Ideally 

I would like to copy the people who made the transition

**Course in ML**

- fast ai (detailed AF) [100 hrs]<-- critically acclaimed by peter and
  this other guy

- random course on coursera for [60hrs]

- Just start with Kaggle and see where it gets you (quick and dirty?)
  [unknown]
  
- https://cloud.google.com/training/data-ml

**Course in Statistics basics**

- Khan academy all questions and answers AP stats?

- Maybe: https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html

- Statistics I Princeton / Coursera

- Data science for social scientists

- microeconomics

But these are books :(

- https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/

- Statistical sleuth 

**Experience with projects**

- experience through kaggle competitions [unknown]

**Sql course**

https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/SQL/SelfPaced/course/ ?



**Tableau learning**


**Prepare projects list**

- shiny nlp (DS)
- kaggle ML (ML)

Work on


### Ideally 2

**starting at kaggle**

for ML... and do exams. as and when necessarey learn from fast.ai

**Peter suggested Pythiath course:**
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/?fbclid=IwAR0a-S06xLRHlFWkCndGe8sjrTMgbAJbteL9HNlcyzmX9azcod-Bzo53KLI

**Statistics course**
Finish Khan Academy Statistics and Probability. 

https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-learning NOT SURE ABUOT THIS!

Do some course...



**ML course**

fast.ai
kaggle
DATACAMP

**DS course**

https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-of-data-analysis-part-1-statistics-usi

coursera course [done already]

**SQL course**


I would like to do the MIT course, Statistics course, follow it up
with heavy KAGGLE for ML (more info on fast.ai) and statistics as
needed.. More problems on data camp


## Examples (tbd)

**Look for examples regarding?**

Above also did a machinelearning course but that was part of the
DSS. prior to jumping into DS FT job. Of course shes much better than
me as a base line with her statistical knowledge. This was her
original [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/@katemarielewis).

vadehi
amrithpal
etc...
## Target 3 months

I want to pick up a statistics course and a DS course and an ML
course. Mainly do examples and see how that goes.


## Explaining logic for ML being first action

I need "ML". Because ASML swears by it. Peter thinks it is
important. ING aslo [seems to want ML](https://www.glassdoor.nl/Vacature/amsterdam-senior-data-engineer-vacatures-SRCH_IL.0,9_IC3064478_KO10,30.htm?rdserp=true&jl=3645420576&guid=00000174a565cfd58bdd695118cab4f1&pos=105&src=GD_JOB_AD&srs=EI_JOBS&s=21&ao=4120). So I am pretty confident ML
is important

Looking at some data scientist jobs this is what I find even to get
selected into an [accelerated program](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2011384814/?eBP=CwEAAAF0pWdjPywntXvzgRXJ4BKRL3Hbil9_83pDATxuaTic8RTFOasMHSc1jvpTPcyIRng3Ufxa-hU4cNiCgsbK_WP0Yq8p0vwF3lBTf3-fb0qf-Kuki4KbYfk2h6fLNPuoRjGA2qQuEnJiRJ09qD5tGFiObo5v6cjhk5QpQBvodmyzPHuSibO0XSzgUWPE7bOL9C6KLaL242r-TM6fhssB-lG4u-m1eXsomDuZ_T1P83B3M10XzTSIqIGyjjINfvg1EKpdbZqzEnjqyF1zGJYCdnKfKwC3Uxbym0-a6TIS23YHGw5ABjl2ZVkBKsdI0CvLKwW9h7EZL4OOkrbi3lTAUZwMN0OjHt7D_KsvAFYU2HbMSepX14lU5nrnCxAyMlxLpCyP9GTiU2o93Q&recommendedFlavor=SCHOOL_RECRUIT&refId=1497270c-d242-475a-babd-7098c67907db&trackingId=Kz6jS4WRH6NTu5KlG%2Fl71Q%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_search_srp_jobs).

Body at apple uses ML as well (it is a must for him). Although he
swears by other things like hypothesis testing using right variables
etc... Need to practice some DS problems. Where to find them though?


## Explaining logic for DS vs DA


salary?


## What to ask people?

How to transition into DS?

How did you transition into DS?

What would you suggest I do?
