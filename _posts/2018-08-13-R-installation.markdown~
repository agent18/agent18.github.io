## Uninstalling R

Lets start here.

	$ R
	> .libPaths() 

Delete these folders that you see as output,

	sudo apt-get remove r-base-core
	sudo apt-get remove r-base
	sudo apt-get autoremove

## Installing R for Ubuntu 16.10

	sudo apt-get install r-base
	
This installs R version 3.2.3. But the latest version is 3.5.

>It installs 3.2 because that's the default in the Ubuntu 16.04
>repository. If you want the most up to date version of R for Ubuntu
>it's best to follow the instructions at the [cran page for R on
>Ubuntu](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/). - [stack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44567499/install-r-latest-verison-on-ubuntu-16-04)


Based on [cran page for R on Ubuntu](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/) && [Stack](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48518006/5986651): add `deb
https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial-cran35/` to
`/etc/apt/sources.list`. Run the following commands:

	sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys
	E084DAB9
	
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install r-base
	
	R --version
	
That is it.

## Installing R-studio

Its a [yak shave](https://mikewilliamson.wordpress.com/2016/11/14/installing-r-studio-on-ubuntu-16-10/) to install it due to the [Gstreamer
dependency](https://mikewilliamson.wordpress.com/2016/11/14/installing-r-studio-on-ubuntu-16-10/). But thanks to the [Mike Williamson and his blog](https://mikewilliamson.wordpress.com/2016/11/14/installing-r-studio-on-ubuntu-16-10/)
and the further answer in [stack](https://askubuntu.com/a/862520/443958), it was a very smooth install for
Ubuntu 16.10 as per [this stack answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48518006/5986651).

**Preparing to install R Studio**

	sudo apt install libjpeg62

**Specifically installing for Ubuntu 16.10** (For other versions refer
to the stack answer):

	wget --tries=3 --timeout=120 http://ftp.ca.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/gstreamer0.10/libgstreamer0.10-0_0.10.36-1.5_amd64.deb
	wget --tries=3 --timeout=120 http://ftp.ca.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/gst-plugins-base0.10/libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0_0.10.36-2_amd64.deb
	sudo dpkg -i libgstreamer0.10-0_0.10.36-1.5_amd64.deb
	sudo dpkg -i libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0_0.10.36-2_amd64.deb
	sudo apt-mark hold libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0
	sudo apt-mark hold libgstreamer0.10

**Installing R Studio**

	wget --tries=3 --timeout=120 https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-xenial-1.1.383-amd64.deb
	sudo dpkg -i rstudio-*-amd64.deb
	
	rstudio
	
Thats it! 


**Note:**

>i386 refers to the 32-bit edition and amd64 (or x86_64) refers to the
>64-bit edition for Intel and AMD processors.- [stack](https://askubuntu.com/a/54298/443958)

## Setting up R with Emacs

[R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-r-with-emacs-and-ess/), suggests to install package `ESS` and
`ESS-smart-underscore` and some other `org` and `org-ref` type of
packages. The org stuff seem to be unnecessary for me, so I skip them
for now. Further more [r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-r-with-emacs-and-ess/) link to their github repository
and the [minimum-working-init-file](https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/Miscellaneous/BodyImage/init.el) for our reference.

The [init-file ](https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/Miscellaneous/BodyImage/init.el) linked above shows that we need to add `require
ess-site`. I don't understand what it is and why we need it. I stick
to installing the required packages `ESS` and
`ESS-smart-underscore`. This can be manually installed with `M-x
package-list-packages RET` or you can add it to the init file. In my
case I add the packages to my `package-init.el` file which will
automatically install it. Furthermore the following is added to the
`init.el` based on [r-bloggers-init-file](https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/Miscellaneous/BodyImage/init.el):

	;; Line numbers
	(add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'linum-mode)

This allows for line numbers during the usage of ESS.

### Testing if the above works

Yes it works.

To get a console simply do:

	M-x R
	
The setup we now want to have is R editor on the left and R console on
the right. Create `testing.R` file. Run `C-x 3` to split the
window. Go to the other window (`C-x 0`). Open the console using `M-x
R`. The following command will make the file in the console.

	C-c C-l

Toodles!

### Writing R code

`_` key is bound to `<-` by default in the `ESS`
mode. `ESS-smart-underscore` tries to overcome this issue (I have not
yet tested how).


		
### Time taken to understand and install and procrastinate
