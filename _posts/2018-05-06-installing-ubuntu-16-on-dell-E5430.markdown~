[Install ubuntu using this link for instructions](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop#5)

The whole installation overwrote a Windows 10 pro edition, which was slow AF for doing normal actions. 

A message inbetween pointed out that the installation would happen with UEFI. Basic search pointed out there might not be any difference on whethere it is UEFI or Bios installation.

**Secure boot off and then it seems to work pretty good.** No squash errors

One of the most peaceful boots I have seen in my home laptop usage

that third-party softwares would not be installed/ or something wierd happens as a result. With Ubuntu, my life is with 3rd party softwares as we don't have "signed" drivers in many cases So, fuck secure boot is the impression I got.

Use F12 to go to menu upon reboot adn find your way to switch off secure boot.
## Upon reload

Get chrome [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/510056/how-to-install-google-chrome) (mainly due to legacy use and page translate). Reproduced for convinience

	wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -

	echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list

	sudo apt-get update 
	sudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable
	
	
## Installing 3rd party softwares as necessary by UBUNTU

So I did this,
