## Goal

Provide examples for claims from 200 phrases from any source using the
recent version of feedback checklist and splitting the claim into
subject and predicate.

## Feedback checklist

Based on the feedback from an STM documented [here](/DP-feedback-key-ideas.html):

**Feedback checklist:**

1. Could it have examples? remember: "civilization is at stake due to AI"
   (consider the possibility it has not examples)

2. True or false? Remember: "There is no doubting the
   force of the argument" (consider a falsifying example)

3. best most no comparison? Remember: "The best career capital is got by working
on the most important problems." (consider if you need to compare)

4. From chapter?  (consider examples from chapter)

5. Running? Remember: "Characteristics of DP explained with tiger
   woods alone" (consider if it is a running example)

6. If-then If Given? "Given that we want batsmen who are short and
have curly hair, here are the batsmen we found: Sachin Tendulkar"
(consider the given type statements)


**Checklist at the end of every example-claim sequence**: 

**Checklist**: yes; false; best; not-chapter; not-running; if  

## AI

> “There is (no doubting)[0] the force of the arguments)[1] … (the problem)[2] is
> (a research challenge worthy of the next generation’s best
> mathematical talent)[3]. (Human civilisation)[4] is (at stake)[5].”  – Clive
> Cookson, Science Editor at the Financial Times 

**Claims**: There is [0] the [1].

**Subject**: About [1].

**Predicate**: there is [0].

**Example**: "One survey of the 100 most-cited living computer science
researchers, of whom 29 responded, found that more than half thought
there was a greater than 50% chance of “high-level machine
intelligence” – one that can carry out most human professions at least
as well as a typical human – being created by 2050, and a greater than
10% chance of it happening by 2024 (see figure below)".

**Definition**: Doesn't check out as survey says there was less than
100% of people who were in favor the claim.

**Checklist**: yes; false; no; not-chapter; not-running; none; "Empirically false"

---

**Claims**: [2] is [3].

**Subject**: [2].

**Predicate**: is [3].

**Example**: Solving the AI control problem

**Definition**: I don't know what the predicate label is trying to say.

**Checklist**: not-sure; neither; none; chapter; not-running; none; "The cryptic predicate"

---

**Claims**: [4] is [5].

**Subject**: [4] due to AI

**Predicate**: [5].

**Example**: No examples.

**Definition**: N/A 

**Checklist**: No; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "The future of nothing"

--- 

> Around 1800, civilization underwent (one of the most profound shifts
> in human history)[2]: (the industrial revolution)[3].

**Claims**: [3] is [2].

**Subject**: [3].

**Predicate**: [2].

**Example**: Less than 1000<span>$</span> was the world average income
until 1800 A.D. This includes the time of agricultural revolution. In
2000 A.D it becomes 8000<span>$</span>. The increase started at around
1800 A.D.

**Definition Checking**: Seems to be on the MOST profound shifts in
human history.

**Checklist**: yes; True; most; chapter; not-running; none; "Simple past"

> textbook, AI: A Modern Approach.2

**Claims**: [1] believe [2].

**Subject**: What [1] believe.

**Predicate**: [2].

**Example**: Looking at the number of signatories for the Future of
Humanities AI open letter in [2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170113141445/http://futureoflife.org/ai-open-letter-signatories/) and [2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180410161122/https://futureoflife.org/ai-open-letter-signatories/) we see that this
list is growing atleast by 100-200 people with designations ranging
from student, dishwasher to CEO of AI ethics lab. The article goes on
to inform that: "Because of the great potential of AI, it is important
to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential
pitfalls."

**Definition**: It looks like all the experts signed up for is:
"Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how
to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls". Whether a
third revolution can occur within the 21st century is not
discussed. Further more the article cited doesn't seem to all be
signed by experts, but people with designations ranging from student,
dishwasher to CEO of Ethics lab etc...

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; chapter; not-running; none; "testable"

## Kamal Harris Debate

[Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democratic-debates-tonight-kamala-harris-joe-biden-confrontation-on-busing-segregationist-comments-and-race/).

> (Sen. Kamala Harris)[1] directly challenged (former Vice President Joe Biden)[2]
> on (his recent comments on civil rights and segregationist lawmakers)[2a],
> delivering (an impassioned critique)[3] that became (the signature exchange
> of the second night of the first Democratic debate)[4].

**Claims**: [1] challenged [2] over [2a].

**Subject**: What [1] said.

**Predicate**: challenged [2] over 2a.

**Example of [1]**: "I agree with you when you commit yourself to the
importance of finding common ground... But it was hurtful to hear
you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this
country."

**Definition**: Doesn't look like [1] challenged [2] about what he
said in [2a]. [1] was merely stating what she thought Joe Biden did.

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; chapter; not-sure-running; none; "testable"

---
 
**Claims**: [1] delivered [3].

**Subject**: What [1], said.

**Predicate**: delivered [3].

**Example**: "I agree with you when you commit yourself to the
importance of finding common ground ... [But] it was hurtful to hear
you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this
country."

**Definition**: This seems to be impassioned critique, something
filled with great emotion and is also an "assessment".

<!-- Impassioned filled with great emotion -->

<!-- An Analysis or assessment of something -->

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; chapter; running; none; "confusing predicate"

---

**Claims**: [1] delivered [3], that became [4].

**Subject**: What [1] said.

**Predicate**:  became [4].

**Example**: "I agree with you when you commit yourself to the
importance of finding common ground ... [But] it was hurtful to hear
you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this
country."

**Definition:** It seems that the example doesn't seem to match the
definition as that particular exchange between Joe Biden and Kamala
Harris was not the only one [highlighted by Trevor Noah in his
Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwWhs_6x42TyRM4Wstoq8HA/videos) about that particular democratic debate. There were other
moments from Bernie Sanders etc...

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; not-chapter; running; none; "testable"

---

> As the other candidates were being asked about race relations and
> racial inequality on Thursday, (Harris)[1], the only woman of color on

> her perspective)[3].

**Claims**: [1] didn't let [3].

**Subject**: What [1] did.

**Predicate**: didn't let [3].

**Example**: While Mariamme Williamson was Farting about Race and the
conversation was moving to Joe Biden, Harris said,"As the only black
person on this stage, I would like to speak on the issue of race..."
to the applause of the people, at which the moderators just stopped.

**Definition**: Example matches the definition. 

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "testable"; 7

> (The California senator)[1] began to press (Biden on his comments)[2]
> about (working with conservative lawmakers)[3] who supported
> (segregation based on race)[4], as well as (his past stance)[5] against
> (busing to desegregate public schools)[6].

**Claims**: Conservative lawmakers who worked with Biden supported
[4].

**Subject**: What conservative law makers who worked with Biden, did.

**Predicate**: Supported [4].

**Example**: James Oliver Eastland testifies, "The Southern
institution of racial segregation or racial separation was the
correct, self-evident truth which arose from the chaos and confusion
of the Reconstruction period. Separation promotes racial harmony. It
permits each race to follow its own pursuits, and its own
civilization..."--- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Eastland)

**Definition**: It appears that Eastland was supporting [4].

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "many
 claims
 in one sentence": "testable"

---

**Claims**: [1] began to press [2] about [3] who [4].

**Subject**: What [1] said.

**Predicate**: press [2] about [3] who [4].

**Example**: "I agree with you when you commit yourself to the
importance of finding common ground ... [But] it was hurtful to hear
you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this
country."

**Definition**: Looks like the example matches the definition.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; chapter; running; none; "many claims in one": "testable"

---

**Claims**: Biden's past stance was against [6].

**Subject**: Biden's past stance.

**Predicate**: Was against [6].

**Example**: Biden said, "I have argued that the least effective way (to
desegregate public schools) is the busing remedy"---[Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/30/politics/kfile-joe-biden-cnn-interview-busing-desegregate-schools/index.html)

**Definition**: This claim is a little tricky I think. It makes it
sound as though Biden didn't want busing which actually "desegregated
public schools". I think Biden was against busing that CLAIMED to
desegregate public schools. So I think the claim is false as it
doesn't match the definition of [6].

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; not-chapter; not-sure; none; "many claims in one": "testable"

---

**Claims**: [1] began to press Biden on [5] "against [6]".

**Subject**: What [1] said.

**Predicate**: press Biden on [5]. 

**Example**: "But Vice President Biden, do you agree today that you
were wrong to oppose busing in America then?", said Kamala.

**Definition**: It appears that the claim is true.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; chapter; not-sure; none; "many claims in one sentence": "testable":11

--- 

> "I do not believe you are a racist," Harris said, looking straight at
> Biden. "I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of

> (the reputations of two United States senators)[1] who built (their
> reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this country)[2]."

**Claims**: Biden talked about [1].

**Subject**: What Biden said.

**Predicate**: was about [1].

**Example**: He went on to describe Talmadge as “one of the meanest
guys” he ever knew but said, “At least there was some civility. We got
things done.”

“I was in a caucus with James O Eastland,” Biden told guests of the
event, briefly imitating the senator’s southern drawl, according to
the press pool report. “He never called me ‘boy’, he always called me
‘son’,” he said. ---[Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/19/joe-biden-segregationist-senators-criticism)

**Definition**: Claim is true, Biden did talk about two US senators.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-sure; none; "testable"

---

**Claims**: The two US senators, (Eastland and Talmagde) built [2].

**Subject**: What Eastland and Talmagde did.

**Predicate**: [2].

**Example**: "I have no prejudice in my heart, but the white race is
the superior race and the Negro race an inferior race and the races
must be kept separate by law." ---[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Eastland)

**Definition**: I do not know how to procure a good example so I can
check against [2].

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-sure; none; "fat
claims"; 13

---

> (Harris)[1] also noted (Biden)[2] opposed (federal measures to ensure that local
> jurisdictions used busing to desegregate public schools during the
> 1970s)[3]. She said that was personally painful for her.

**Claims**: [2] opposed [3].

**Subject**: What [2] did.

**Predicate**: opposing [3].

**Example**: "Biden voted *Yea* to ban federal courts from ordering
busing as a school segregation remedy and to prevent the justice
department from taking part in pro-busing litigation". --- [Source](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33375834/the_philadelphia_inquirer/)

**Definition**: The example matches the definition.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "testable"

**Claims**: [1] cannot be [2].

**Subject**: Discussion amongst Democrats

**Predicate**: cannot be intellectual

**Example**: *Very vague labels and hard to give examples for this*

**Definition**: *No idea how to test against the predicate, nor do I
have an example.*

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
"confusing predicate"

---

> Harris' passionate appeal elicited some of the loudest applause of

**Claims**: Given [1], [2] challenged [3].

**Subject**: Given [1], what [2] said.

**Predicate**: challenged [3].

**Example**: "That's a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did
 not praise racists", said Biden.
 
**Definition**: It appears that [2] challenged [3]. But whether he
challenged only when given [1], is not clear (I would need to watch
the debate to see if he was being given the chance to respond or if he
interjected).

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; given;
"testable" 16

> "(That's)[1] (a mischaracterization of my position across the
> board)[2]. (I)[3a] (did not praise racists)[3]," he said, touting his support
> for civil rights and highlighting his work as public defender.

**Claims**: [1] is [2].

**Subject**: What Kamal said about Biden.

**Predicate**: is [2].

**Example**: Kamala said, "It was hurtful to hear you talk ("highly")
about the reputations of two United States senators who built their
reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this country."

**Definition**: 

All Biden said was “At least there was some civility. We didn’t agree
on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished". This
doesn't look like Biden was praising the two US senators, characterized
as racists.

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; chapter; not-sure; none;  "testable"

---

**Claims**: [3a] did not praise [3].

**Subject**: What [3a] said.

**Predicate**: did not praise racists

**Example**: Biden said in the past, "At least there was some
civility. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We
got it finished"

**Definition**: Example does seem to match the definition.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-sure; none; "testable"

> "If we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil
> rights and whether I did or not, I'm happy to do that," Biden said.

> Harris continued her questioning. "But Vice President Biden, do you

> asked.
>
> "(I)[1] did not oppose (busing in America)[2]. What I opposed was (busing ordered
> by the Department of Education)[3]," Biden replied.

**Claims**: Biden did not oppose [2].

**Subject**: What Biden did.

**Predicate**: did not oppose [2].

**Example**: "The point I was trying to make is when you're trying to
remedy the situation, what happened was the system whereby you could
impose a busing remedy in an area where you had black, white, black,
white living on the same block, it made a great deal of sense," Biden
added. "But where you ended up with disparate neighborhoods long
distances apart but were segregated and you tried to integrate the
facilities, it created a number of mechanical problems that are
significant." --- [Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/30/politics/kfile-joe-biden-cnn-interview-busing-desegregate-schools/index.html)

**Definition**: It looks like Biden is not opposed to busing in it's
entirety. He seems to be opposed to a particular type of busing. I
guess that's what he meant by saying "he is not opposed to busing in
America".

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "testable"

---

**Claims**: Biden opposed [3].

**Subject**: What Biden did or said.

**Predicate**: opposed [3].

**Example**: "Biden voted *Yea* to ban federal courts from ordering
busing as a school segregation remedy and to prevent the justice
department from taking part in pro-busing litigation". --- [Source](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33375834/the_philadelphia_inquirer/)

**Definition**: It seems that the example matches the definition.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "testable"

> (segregation in public schools based on race)[4].

**Claims**: [2] failed to [1], after [3].

**Subject**: what [2] did.

**Predicate**: failed to [1].

**Example**: All schools in Berkeley fully desegregated after two decades
after the brown ruling.

**Definition**: The example matches the definition.

**Checklist**: yes; true; many; not-chapter; not-running; none ; "testable"

---

**Claims**: [3] outlawed [4].

**Subject**: Brown vs. Board of Education 

**Predicate**: outlawed [4].

**Example**: "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483
(1954),[1] was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which
the Court ruled that American state laws establishing racial
segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the
segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality." -[WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education)

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "testable" 

---

> When she mentioned that (her schools in Berkeley)[1] fully (desegregated
> nearly two decades after the Brown ruling)[2], Biden said (it)[3] was because
> of (the decisions of local governments)[4].

**Claims**: [1] fully desegregated after [2].

**Subject**: When [1] fully desegregated.

**Predicate**:  after [2].

**Example**: "Finally, on Jan. 15, 1968, the School Board voted unanimously
to desegregate all 14 of the District’s elementary schools the
following September."- [Source](https://www.berkeleyschools.net/2018/12/50th-anniversary-of-berkeleys-pioneering-busing-plan-for-school-integration/)

**Definition**: Does not check out. 1954 to Jan 1968 is fourteen
years, NOT NEARLY TWO DECADES.

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "testable" 

---

**Claims**: [3] was because of [4].

*because*

> "So, that's when the (federal government steps in)[1]," she countered,
> adding later, "(There are moments in history)[2] where (states)[3] fail to
> (preserve the civil rights of all people)[4]."

**Claims**: [3] fail to [4].

**Subject**: [3] fail.

**Predicate**:  to [4].

**Example**: Prior to 1965, [Mississippi seems to have deterred black
voters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Summer) from voting by making them take questionnaires which were
evaluated by white registrars and not just directly allowing them to
cast their vote as the Whites did.

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "testable" 

---

**Claims**: The federal government steps in when state fails to
preserve the civil rights of all people.

**Subject**: The federal government steps in

**Predicate**: when state fails to preserve the civil rights of all
people.

**Example**: Voting rights act of 1965 by the federal government which
led to an increase in voting of black people in [Mississippi from
6.7% to 59.8%. Mississippi is historically 40% black.](https://www.vox.com/2015/3/6/8163229/voting-rights-act-1965)

**Definition**: Checks out! The failure of the states is noted by the
6.7% black votes possibly due to discriminatory practices by the
state.

**Checklist**: yes; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
"future with example" 

---

**Claims**: Federal Government **should** have stepped in to reduce the
delay in desegregation.

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "should"

the disfranchisement of racial minorities.

## Remarks

Can you please comment on the following as well.

### Not sure if something is a running example (atleast 8/133 claims) 

Not sure if something is running or not? What is the definition. I
remember the DP example of talking about tiger woods and that's it. In
the Kamala Harris Debate article what would be the running example?
When is it running and when is it not? I have below 2 examples.

> (Sen. Kamala Harris)[1] directly challenged (former Vice President Joe Biden)[2]
> on (his recent comments on civil rights and segregationist lawmakers)[2a],
> delivering (an impassioned critique)[3] that became (the signature exchange
> of the second night of the first Democratic debate)[4].

**Claims**: [1] delivered [3].

**Subject**: What [1], said.

**Predicate**: delivered [3].

**Example**: "I agree with you when you commit yourself to the
importance of finding common ground ... [But] it was hurtful to hear
you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this
country."

**Definition**: This seems to be impassioned critique, something
filled with great emotion and is also an "assessment".

<!-- Impassioned filled with great emotion -->

<!-- An Analysis or assesment of something -->

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; chapter; running; none 

---

> (The California senator)[1] began to press (Biden on his comments)[2]
> about (working with conservative lawmakers)[3] who supported
> (segregation based on race)[4], as well as (his past stance)[5] against
> (busing to desegregate public schools)[6].

**Claims**: Biden's past stance was against [6].

**Subject**: Biden's past stance.

**Predicate**: Was against [6].

**Example**: Biden said, "I have argued that the least effective way (to
desegregate public schools) is the busing remedy"---[Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/30/politics/kfile-joe-biden-cnn-interview-busing-desegregate-schools/index.html)

**Definition**: This claim is a little tricky I think. It makes it
sound as though Biden didn't want busing which actually "desegregated
public schools". I think Biden was against busing that CLAIMED to
desegregate public schools. So I think the claim is false as it
doesn't match the definition of [6].

**Checklist**: yes; false; none; not-chapter; not-sure-running; none 

### When do things have or don't have examples? (12/133 claims)

Throughout the essay at many places in the essay I am unsure whether a
statement has examples or not. For example,

> “There is (no doubting)[0] the force of the arguments)[1] … (the problem)[2] is
> (a research challenge worthy of the next generation’s best
> mathematical talent)[3]. (Human civilisation)[4] is (at stake)[5].”  – Clive
> Cookson, Science Editor at the Financial Times 

**Claims**: [2] is [3].

**Subject**: [2].

**Predicate**: is [3].

**Example**: Solving the AI control problem

**Definition**: I don't know what the predicate label is trying to say.

**Checklist**: not-sure; neither; none; chapter; not-running; none 

### Hard to give example, more time more research needed? (39/133 claims)

What should I do in cases where it would take a lot of time to
research an example. It seems to be of less value to me to work on the
finding an example for the John Oliver video. Where as if this was
statistics, I should probably spend more time on it.

**Claims**: The two US senators, (Eastland and Talmagde) built [2].

**Subject**: What Eastland and Talmagde did.

**Predicate**: [2].

**Example**: "I have no prejudice in my heart, but the white race is
the superior race and the Negro race an inferior race and the races
must be kept separate by law." ---[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Eastland)

**Definition**: I do not know how to procure a good example so I can
check against [2].

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none 

can you even give examples for this? there is like a causal link

**Claims**: Federal Government **should** have stepped in to reduce the
delay in desegregation.

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none 

### Implies because, due to, means

We had already agreed to not go into "because" statements for now. The
following is an example with "means" (or implies). How are we to give
examples for this? or do we skip these as well?

> (Average (pay is 0.63 <span>$</span>))[1], that means there are (states
> where Prisoners make considerable less )[2]

**Claims**: [1] means [2] exists.

### Is it possible to give examples for should?

> You should not have to choose between buying a pair of diapers and
> allowing a girl to talk to her daddy.

**Subject**: You, choosing between buying a pair of diapers and
allowing a girl to talk to her daddy.

**Predicate**: should not happen

**Example**: *No example*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: not sure; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none 

---

**Claims**: Federal Government **should** have stepped in to reduce the
delay in desegregation.

**Checklist**: yes; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none
