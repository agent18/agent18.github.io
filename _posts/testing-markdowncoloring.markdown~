## GOAL:

Summary, wague

Rationalist taboo


Clear goals, immediate feedback, challenging 


### Clear Goals

Based on [this](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/) 

<!-- Making a list of options -->
What do you want to do in life? Exact examples of profiles that you
would like to be like?


What are the different career paths you think are available to you?
Give one way how you would achieve it?

<!-- Rankingish your options  -->
Compare them based on Skills, Connections, Credentials, Runway,
&
Personal fit, job satisfaction, Impact

<!-- Write out key uncertainities -->
What is the info that can change your ranking?

### What do you hate?

rewriting, correcting spelling, rewriting large large chunks of shit!

<!-- Get wholistic view using S-TAB -->
Lets try to work on sections that are well defined as shown in the
Clear Goals section. We will continue to have the overview of what we
are doing, instead of just writing using the power of cycling `S-TAB`.

<!-- Re-write and refactor, do not repeat -->
We will write like we speak and edit per section or subsection. We
will refactor, rewrite and correct spelling then and there or as
required. We will just not keep blabbing shit for one hr as that makes
it difficult for editing.

<!-- Remove -->
We will remove everything as is required.


No wifi writing for 45 mins

## Making a list of options

Making it Testing!

### What do you want to be?

Either I earn-to-give or we do direct work, which leads to saving
lives. Earning to give needs no explanation. An example of direct work
would be to lead an NGO that stages interventions.



Over the course of sifting through [80k hours](80000hrs.org) website, I have seen
many profiles and would aspire to be like those people. Below is a
small summary of such profiles.

#### Earning-to-give 

- **An investment banker** who will earn in millions and give away >50% of
his salary.

- **Management Consulting** and earn > 250k$  in 5-10 years and give
  as much as possible
  
- **Data scientist/Project Management** and earn in 200k$ in 5-10
  years and give as much as possible
  
- **Programming** and earn in 200k$ in 5-10 years and give as much as
  possible

- **Entrepreneurship**
  
  * [ ] Earning potential in each of these professions please


[Ben West](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/ben-west/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentwest/)) an entrepreneur was in connection with
80k hours, able to set aside his uncertainty and now based on his
evaluation, he is expected to donate millions to charity. He is going
to keep a minimum fucking wage.

Amazing, he can even say things like this!

#### Direct working

>80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should
>earn to give long term. we think that most people should be doing
>things like politics, policy, high-value research, for-profit and
>non-profit entrepreneurship, and direct work for highly socially
>valuable organizations.

- Found & Lead Effective Altruism organizations as necessary or most
  impactful
  
[Tara Macaulay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)), (then) head of operation (now CEO)
in the Centre for Effective Altruism. Tara has always been outstanding
at her work, be it with saving money for her company or rising the
ranks very fast. She has apparently left a lasting impact in Bhutan
where she worked on direct impact project

*She interned without pay at CEA* leading the fuck out of it and then
rose the ranks to become the current CEO. 

TBW, She has no MBA degrees. She has a pharma degree.

[Rob Mather](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-mather-b0331235/)), CEO of Against Malaria foundation,
critically acclaimed as one of the most effective organizations.

TBW, He has had top education, and possibly an all the time high
achiever who went to Harvard Business School and University of
Cambridge.

[David Goldberg](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/david-goldberg/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjonathangoldberg/)), co-founder of Founders Pledge,
that makes Tech entrepreneurs donate by pledging in case their
startups succeed.

TBW, He is definitely another high achiever, who went to Cambridge,
but has a degree in philosophy. He has done everything other than
continuing with philosophy. He has founded 2 organizations per companies,

>Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance in the US, started
>and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
>in California. All in, a pretty bizarre career trajectory if I’m
>honest, which was largely the result of having no clear idea of what
>I wanted to do with my life until recently.

  * [ ] Seems to be a scope to intern at these places (seems to be
        working based on availability)
		
	
[Niel Bowerman ](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/niel-bowerman/)(Linkedin), previously the Assistant Director of
Future of Humanity Institute, (Oxford University), is another
outstanding talent featured in the 80k hours website.

TBW he does not have an MBA, he is a physics major, currently handling
fundraising, operations management etc... and now he is the head of AI
policy. 

**Lessons learnt:**

Not everyone has an MBA. Everyone has shown definite signs of
greatness from the beginning and looking at their profile, they are
headed for more greatness. 

Strong interpersonal skills maybe?

- Being an Analyst, researcher at GiveWell or 80000hrs

In organizations like GiveWell and 80000 hrs, they need people to do
the research to identify using data & researching what is better and
how we can do best. In other words solving problems with limited data,
knowing what type of data is interesting and finding it.

Here the main criteria are strong critical thinking skills, and
statistics or Math knowledge. 

- Policy and others

I think this is too far-fetched for me. I skip it for now. 

#### Building career capital

[Dillon Bowen](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/dillon-bowen/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dillon-bowen-409791a1/)) another high achiever is working
towards his Economics PhD based on the counseling he got from
80k. Economics PhD is highly recommended graduate program by 80k
hours, due to the high impact in direct working.

But I don't really think I have the age or the talent for an Economics
PhD.



TBW, He has no MBA, as a result.

[Peter Huford](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/peter-hurford/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhurford8/)), another outstanding talent, taught
himself how to program from political science background that now, he
is improving his skills in business, programming and finance and also
having extra time to work on other charity projects.


  * [ ] Appears that I should follow something like this, and talk to
        Herman maybe, as the spending time on an MBA to do some IB is
        not really seeming to be required. A better understanding or
        working or creation of new things can increase the outcome 10
        fold in no time. I think I should just focus on things like
        this and get better and become really skillful.


#### summary

In summary I would like the skills to be like these people or at least
earn a lot to give. I would like to leave such a legacy behind like
that of TARA. It is important for me to dream big and currently these
people are already like a hard goal, a challenging goal for me I
guess.

The importance of direct work has been stressed a lot by 80k hours. In
the long run that is what I guess I should be doing. But for the next
few years, no harm in making money as well as building career
capital. But money is not the objective, getting yourself in shape to
do good is. Gaining skills to make crazy impact is.

So, Ability to work in leading roles or operational roles in NGO's or
found my own NGO, is one of the things I see myself doing. or even
doing the research that they deem the most necessary, or earning
crazily to give.

### Making the list

Making a list according to 80k hours sounds far-too-specific like
"economics researcher focusing on global health", "marketing for meat
substitutes" etc...

I am afraid I am right now only trying to figure out what could be the
direction I would be expected to go in, i.e., **the next few years &
early career choices** in an attempt of collecting career capital in
the direction of where I want to be. I assume I cannot be certain in
determining exactly what I am going to be doing @ 45. But as pointed
out earlier, you can see what I would like to grow towards.

Furthermore if I miss something, I would like to put the onus on my
reviewers, aka the 80k community, an STM and the decision tool to help
me out.

#### My rough list!

Roughly I imagine the list to be:

1) Continuing in the same job or being a design engineer and rising
the ranks as so.

- Far too specific information learning at the moment (suspect it is useless)

As echoed previously to myself and in my archive, it appears that I am
learning something too specific, like how to make drawings and how to
design in tight tolerances, these are far too specific

- I do a bit of trouble shooting and critical thinking, I would like
  to do more.

- I do not want to work on puzzling out more about volumes and
interferences manually, say using (god-forbid) powerpoint. for
example, things I could do with a better tool. Of course I could have
a better way of work. Well let there be better problems to solve.

2) An MBA to management consulting or IB or trading(very high job
satisfaction according to 80k hours) for now, hoping to get some
experience and a lot of money, to propel career ahead.

Right now it appears that the an MBA can open avenues into consulting,
IB and Trading. These seem to allow to get good experience and a lot
of money. Job satisfaction and long hours might suffer for a few.

Other than doing an MBA there dont seem many options. And I have
echoed my sentiment to a couple of MBA graduates who seem to agree
([IB at JP Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ram-narayan-86b7b199/)),([Marketeer from Newyork who has scholarships in
MBA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rawanalhaffar/)), Another friend who is an Analyst in California going into
product management.

But right now I do not need to make the choice of what I will be
taking. I can leave that decision for sometime in the future.

3) Data science (research, critical thinking?), moving on to
programming or not

I sort of club DS and programming together. As I see DS my first
direction to go into even if programming is what I might do in the
end. DS already involves some programming and I can get a job I think
quickly (3 months) in Netherlands and from there get better at it and
programming and see where it takes me. Although, DS would be much more
oriented towards critical thinking I guess.

4) Starting up

No idea where to start, no ideas of what to start, lack of skill and
confidence. A tech start-up sounds interesting, maybe I could find
some work there. I could go over to some meeting in rotterdam and see
what the scene is like. 

I think we should expect a long lead time with tech startups,
especially ones that involve making a phisical product of any
nature. 

Although I am currently working in a startup I see that I don't have
any "startup benifits"

5) Joining an NGO, starting as an Intern

6) Data-science or Programming in Finance (best of two worlds)
	
#### Career Quiz: recommended list of careers

The career quiz with the selected options result in the following
career choices: 

1) Could you become good at math, science or logic?
Yes (outperform 80% of graduates)

2) Could you become good at writing and speaking? 
Yes (Outperforming 80% of graduates in a humanities subject)

3) Are you happy betting on a small chance of a big impact?
No

4) Are you happy trying to work in the most demanding fields?
Yes

Challenging and long hours should not be a problem I suppose. I have
seen evidences of this in my past, with my master thesis(10-14 hrs a
day, programming, reading), with my work in IIT Madras (easily clocked
10 hrs or more a day for 1 year atleast), Courses in my masters
etc... and for a while I would work 8 hrs a day and come back home and
spend 2 hrs a day writing and researching etc... 

5) How far through your career are you?

Early (27) finished masters and working for ~2 years

6) How do you want to contribute? 

All possible ways: Direct, indirect, earning to give, research etc...

And the out put is:

- Policy oriented Civil services
- Economics PhD
- Data Science (skill building and earning to give)
- Working at effective non-profites
- Machine learning PhD
- Software engineering (skill building and earning to give)
- Trading in quantitative hedge funds

When we are ready to bet on small chances then:

- Congressional staffer
- Policy oriented Civil services
- Machine learning PhD
- Working at effective Altruist organizations
- Founding effective non-profits
- Data science
- Party politics


#### My next steps

The focus for this article should be that I develop through this post
what I should do next, like in the next 6 months. Where should I begin
and what should I do.

I am broadly looking at few things based on the rough list I have and
the Career Quiz

1. Sticking to design engineering

	- Working in the US?
	- Staying in DE
	- Attempting to startup
	- Going into the NGO management after a few years in this field.
	
2. Moving to DataScience
   
   - DS
   - Programming
   - Machine learning PhD
   - Working at GiveWell type of NGO's
   
3. Doing an MBA

	- IB
	- NGO as analyst or management
	- Management Consulting
	- Marketting Sales
	- trading in quantitative hedge funds
	
	
4. Civil services

	Dont know where or how to start, other than in India, but I am not
    sure of the evaluating the kind of impact I can have in India
	
5. Think Tanks

6. Working at Effective Altruism organizations

#### Comparing

The plan is to write about these:

Compare them based on Career Capital:  Skills, Connections, Credentials, Runway,
&
Personal fit, job satisfaction, Supportive conditions, Impact

And to all the career options I have until now.

Following this, I would like to also use the decision making chart and
the decision tool of the 80k hours website to do the same. 



**Career Capital**

Skills:

>Skills – what will you learn in this job, and how fast will you
>learn? You can break skills down into transferable skills, knowledge
>and personality traits. Some especially useful transferable skills
>include: personal productivity, analysis and problem-solving, the
>ability to learn quickly, decision-making, social skills, and
>management. We cover why and how to learn them in a later article. If
>you want to do good, you also need to learn all about the world’s
>most pressing problems and how to solve them. A job will be best for
>learning when you are pushed to improve and get lots of feedback from
>mentors.

- Transferable skills
  - personal productivity
  - Critical thinking, analysis and problem solving
  - ability to learn quickly
  - decision-making
  - social skills
  - management
- Knowledge

- Personality traits
  - Confidence



Connections:

>Connections – who will you work with and meet in this job? Your
>connections are how you’ll find opportunities, spread ideas and start
>new projects. The people you spend time with also shape your
>character. For both reasons, it’s important to make connections who
>are influential and who care about social impact.

Are my connections going to get me jobs in different industries or
other industries?

Are my connections going to inspire me to do good?

Are my connections influential?

Credentials:

> will this job act as a good signal to future collaborators or
> employers? Note that we don’t just mean formal credentials like
> having a law degree, but also your achievements and reputation. If
> you’re a writer, it’s the quality of your blog. If you’re a coder,
> it’s your GitHub.

Runway:

>how much money will you save in this job? Your runway is how long you
>could comfortably live with no income. It depends on both your
>savings and how much you could reduce your expenses by. We recommend
>aiming for at least six months of runway to maintain your financial
>security. 12-18 months of runway is even more useful because it gives
>you the flexibility to make a major career change. It’s usually worth
>paying down high-interest debt before donating more than 1% per year
>or taking a big pay cut for greater impact.

Ability to quickly save enough money for 18 months is what seems to be
defining runway. How much I can donate is a question answerd by the
impact section.

Runway seems to be always important.

**Supportive conditions**

- Engaging work
- Colleagues
- Basic needs
- fit with rest of life

> Impact and personal life
> Engaging work - Will you get freedom to decide how to work, clear tasks, clear feedback and variety in what you do?
> Colleagues- Will you like them and will they support you?
> basic needs- Will you earn enough money, will the hours be manageable, and will the commute be reasonable?
> Fit with rest of your life -– Will you be able to improve your
> personal relationships, and uphold any other important personal
> priorities?

[Source: how to compare different careers ](https://80000hours.org/articles/framework/#questions-for-assessing-each-factor) 

**Personal Fit**

What are your chances of excelling in that area?

**In summary,**

 $ (f1xCareer Capital +f2xImpact +f3supportive conditions) *
 Personalfit
 
>If you are still early in your career, then it’s best to place
>greater importance on career capital than on role impact

>The more uncertain you are about the long-run, the more you should
>prioritise flexible career capital over

>The more altruistically-minded you are, the less weight you’ll need
>to place on job satisfaction relative to the other factors.

There by I see f1 = 1, f2 = 0.7, and f3 = 0.5.

80k suggests role-impact and not impact. This would mean that I
somehow have an idea of what problem I have chosen to focus
on. On a high level, it is all about saving lives, adding good years
to lives around the world now and later. 

To simplify the solving of the above problem, I suggest we just stick
to impact as being saving lives. I will try to make estimations of
saving lives with this.


#### Design engineering (Machine Design) in 'Europe' for Direct work

**Skills**: 

- Skills are too specific

Right now I am learning a very specific amount of skills. Skills like
making proper drawings, Skills on how to design for the precision
industry, What type of motors work where, how to keep things simple
etc... Great for the precision engineering market but I dont think it
preps me for the Leadership or research type of jobs that I plan in
the future. 

- Not very challenging all the time, not pushed to do more or given a
lot of feedback

A last word is that as an engineer I have to do a lot of unnecessary
things, kind a like doing experiments manually. In other words wasting
time (Not doing anything creative or useful in the long run). Time is
really precious and you would want every single minute to count. I see
myself 'wasting' a lot of time here. 

Last is I work for <40 hrs a week and I am barely at any pressure or
pushed to achieve great things,

- gaining management skills takes a long while before it happens

Even if I become a design leader (as they call it here), it would take
say 8 years atleast (35), where I go into a tech leadership kind of
role, where I am managing a technical team, knowing on a high level
what my team is doing. 

- Small percentage of critical thinking

A part of my work is also critical thinking but it is definitely a
small part (20-30%), but it is a small part. 

- Not very valuable even with many many years of experience

As far as I have seen and the fact that even glassdoor says this, more
experience is not really valued a lot beyond 1-2 decades. My
colleague ears 52k with 30 years of expereince and I earn 40k. If I
switch companies already I can make as much as him.

So, the dearth of transferable skills, the minimum quantity of
critical thinking, a decent amount of creativity building. Going to
another company, can't imagine life being very different. 

So,
Overall I give it like an average rating of 5.


**Connections**:


I will work with other design engineers and physicists in the job. I
might be able to find opportunities in related fields. But I don't
think this would be useful, considering that this is probably not the
industry I should continue in. 

My connections might be useful in finding jobs in the same industry
but otherwise, I would assume that they will be useless almost. 

This is live below average of 3. 


**Credentials**:

Typical credentials include, sudden promotions, rewards for delivery
on time, or that I designed something that had very positive end
results.

Except for the last thing informing that I am a good designer
(specific for this job), I am will not be able to boast any reasonable
achievements that can look good on my application to GiveWell or other
cool NGO's or even startups.

It seems like a normal 9-5 job with some performance indicators of me
learning quickly but that is it I think.

For a writer it is his blog, for a coder it is his Github, for a
mechanical deisgner, it is his portfolio of work done till now, which
would of course be useful to take up other jobs in the same precision
industry. 

So I rate this as average at best average (5).

**Runway**:

In Netherlands I can save about 10k euros per year. Removing my
donation, and all other extra expenses that seem to be coming, I think
I can save about 6k per year. I can improve this by 4k.

Runway gathering takes a slow 3 years. 6.

**Personal Fit**:

To excel in this area would mean to somehow gain skills or sanity to
either found an NGO, or work in one in operations or research.

- chances of learning skills at the age of 33 within design
  engineering (85%)
- possibility of learning the right skills within this industry (60%)
- Getting a job after in either research or management in top NGO's
  based on research or operations related credentials (70%)
  
  I don't expect it to be as tough as getting a job in MC. Plus I have
  quite some spare time on my hand. I could always look to improve my
  knowledge and skills. I would have 40 days of vacation every year,
  which I could really use to become better or even take internships.

So a total 35%.

**Impact**:

I made some calculations on the number of lives saved if one works for
top NGO's like GiveWell or 80k hours. It comes to about 600-3000 lives
(shown in appendix). Another estimate by a person who worked there,
relates to 1500 lives (extrapolated to 40 years). We use this number
as it is made by a givewell employee.  As we will be spending the next
10 years prepping for it in essence, we would have 970 lives of impact
in case we still pursued Direct work at top organizations despite
being after 10 years of our life.

As mentioned in the appendix, pitfalls of this '970 lives' number, is
that it is based on the contribution of a person offering 10% impact
as that of the co-founder. Another thing is that the whole [Indirect
effects](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) is not taken into account at all. So in essence we would
be saving many more than 970 lives. 


**Supporting conditions**

Work is engaging, I can always find challenges. Work outside of DE
towards the Direct Work can also be quite engaging. Basic needs are
met, It will fit with the rest of the life, Colleagues are all fine
and ready to help when you ask for help. 

It has hard to find like minded people here who share any interest in
Altruism. Of all the people I have met, I do not know a single soul
who does anything close to 10% of donation. They are too busy
chilling, going to the beach, working and planning on pleasurable
activities after activities. 

<!-- Not that I am any great soul or something; Well ;)-->

**Summary**

With the intention of doing Direct Work, it still seems
alright. Rather I don't think it gives me any special skills but it
gives me time (22hrs a week on avg), a citizenship, sabbatical leave
with which I can slowly and meticulously plot my way out of DE to
Direct work.

<!-- This para does not belong here but in the NGO section -->

I estimated the lives saved between 600 to 3000 and the[ Analyst at
GiveWell](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) estimates lives saved at 1500 (extrapolated over 40
years). This is based on 3% compounding interest of the expected
contribution in the first year. Climbing the ladder might contribute
much larger impact as for now the considered impact is only based on
10% of co-founders contribution. Also there is a lot of indirect
impact due to the organizations which goes unaccounted for. Working in
NGO's like 80k should save > 1500 people I guess. Which is a decently
large number. Turns out to be 5 times larger than estimates by just
doing DE for earning-to-give.

	
#### Design engineering (Machine Design) in 'Europe' for Earning to give

With this section we attempt to deal with 3 types of ways of earning
to give. One with being an all-the-time DE in NL, doing DE for now,
but then moving on to Sales and the other moving to the US and
sticking to DE and/or sales.

DE in Europe is a low paying job as compared to the US
options. Depending on the size of the company your pay varies. 

<!-- going to the US with DE might be possible but I suspec only with -->
<!-- L1 I will make a separate post out of it -->

With the following I try to see how many lives I can save with such an
earning, what is the extent of flexible CC being here in Europe and in
PE (precision engineering).

**Skills**:

- Not very challenging all the time, not pushed to do more and given
  only a decent amount of feedback.

I work for <40 hrs a week and I am barely at any pressure or
pushed to achieve great things,

- gaining management skills takes a long while before it happens

As mentioned before, it would take 7-8 years before I move into a
Design Leader position.

- Small percentage of critical thinking

As said earlier 20-30% is probably critical thinking.

- Not very valuable even with many many years of experience

As said before.

- Decent transferable skills

I will have quite some knowledge of the Semicon industry, maybe a good
chance to port to Sales, So I think it does offer some sort of FCC
(flexible Career capital) to offer. Even within my company they were
looking for people in the management side who would have more than 5
years of Semicon experience. Plus I have seen the useless nutheads in
sales who do not understand the product and have no idea what it can
do and still pitch it to others, I think I would be a welcome relief
to such an industry needing solid engineers who can also talk.

Although I am not sure of why going into automotive or space might be
interesting, moving to other such industries might be hard or
impossible. I have seen people move from other industries to
precision, but not the other way around. I suspect going the other way
might need a lot of pre-knowledge and your knowledge might just not be
fully portable. So I can stay in PE for ever, not a problem, there
should be enough scope for me to do so I guess. Atleast I don't see
why not.

With my free time I can prep in DS but I don't expect to become really
good at it as I am working only part time. I have 2 months of vacation
and all this can be used for additional good.

- All companies in Netherlands, Germany, Europe have this lifestyle in
general.

A decent amount of transferable skills, the minimum quantity
of critical thinking, a decent amount of creativity while working.

So, 
- Transferable skills : 6.5

**Connections**:

I will work with other design engineers and physicists in the job. I
might be able to find opportunities in related fields.

Connections might be useful in finding jobs outside. Do not have any
out of the world connections that will actually help. 

This sounds like it is at 4, slightly better than last section.

**Credentials**:

I see myself growing up the ladder very very slowly (4-5 years per
promotion). It is a slow working environment (mainly because of
research). Right now maybe I can boast to other precision companies
regarding what I could do for them.

The first two years leave me with very little credentials worthy for
the Semicon market as there were some cancellations of projects, but I
am hopeful about the next few months. But still I am quite positive I
can find my way in the Semicon industry to the World Leader ASML's
house even now. 

Credentials wise, as I am in the Semicon and expect to move into
Semicon or other PE related work, I suspect I should survive and be
able to quote something decent.

Credential level assignments need to be given and take time and other
company priorities come in the way of my success.

I would put it at an above average value of 6.

**Runway**:

Same as quoted in the previous section. Runway of 18k would take
realistically 3 years and there is scope for improvement if I move to
another company but still remains average of 6.

Runway in case I move into sales will be different, but right now I
would have to clock my years in PE before I make the ultimate
decision.

The same with moving to the US as well.

<!-- Ways of moving to the US and prolty estimates unknown, but runway -->
<!-- could be crazy, but I still suspect I need to clock a few good -->
<!-- years here before I am able to migrate reasonably-->

**Personal Fit**:

To excel in this area would mean 

- being a typical engineer for the rest of my life and grow through
  the ranks slowly and probably consulting after a period of time.  
  I estimate this at 95% chance of success for me. This is like the
  minimum I should be able to achieve at any cost. (95%)
  
- Somehow see opportunity into sales and move into it after a few
years in the PE industry.
But is sales a good fit for me? I don't know, I have seen random
people move into sales and succeed. My cousin was an ordinary
Mechanical Engineer who rose the ranks in sales and got crazy
cuts. Another cousin moved from electrical engineering (brainy guy
though) and managed a killer career.

I will atleast try a brief stint if I am stuck to DE. I can always
fall back to DE as and when I like. The way I would do it is join ASML
(the leading lithographers) and from there see where it takes me. 

So I expect the chance to be slightly more than landing an elite MC
job. (65%)

- Moving to the US reduces the chances of success but 

**Impact**:

The impact of being a typical engineer for the next 40 years is
estimated to be ~200 lives.

The impact of moving into sales can probably significantly switch
things up, but I estimate it at 2 times the impact of full time DE. If
I can donate 20% and also make an extra 20% in sales then that will
result twice the impact. Yes I am pulling these numbers almost out of
my ass, as I don't have good estimates of it. I will refine this
number later.



	
#### Data science for direct giving

**Skills**

Statistics, critical thinking, programming and machine learning could
be the knowledge and skills I would transfer to research based jobs,
and not necessarily leadership based jobs. However I suspect that a
role in project management after a few years could get me somewhere
like an all-rounder in the field of DS.

Also DS is only the starting point. Once I start DS, programming,
using different languages all will be things I will be working on,
which allows for a machine learning PhD maybe. DS looks like a good
place to start skills wise.

>The technical skills you develop also open the possibility to
>transition into different roles including software engineering,
>founding or joining early-stage startups, academia, and quant
>finance. - [80k-DS](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/) 

These are quite some possibilities 

- Transferable skills
  - personal productivity: 6
  - Critical thinking, analysis and problem solving: 7.5
  - ability to learn quickly: 7
  - decision-making:6
  - social skills: 4
  - management : 4.5
  - team working:
- Knowledge: 8

- Personality traits
  - Confidence: 6
  
I also suspect DS unlike the R&D work that I am doing, will be faster
paced and so I suspect that there is more learning happening.

**Connections**

Depending on where I work and what I do for which which companies. If
it is an in house job, then you are not chatting with clients, but if
you are consulting or doing work for clients, then possible better
connections than design engineering. For lack of knowing any better, I
raise it by one point more than Design engineering.

**Credentials**

DS has a fast paced scene as I get from 80k. Faster feedback cycle,
and large connection between work and outcomes can be felt. Further
impression I get is that you can brag about your outcomes, rather they
will be braggable to a future employer. Seeing my friend in DS and
what all he has bragged about being in Musigma in his first 2 years
sound amazing.

I suspect with this career, that would be one advantage, i.e., to be
able to brag with credentials. For example, X was low and I suggested
Y and then X soured.

Companies like KLM even have jobs for engineers and data
scientists. This could be quite lucrative for me and for the company,
as I span both the spectra.

So I give it a 7

**Runway** 
My friend in the US earns top dollar in Apple. Once you are Apple
worth, there seems to be a lot of potential scope and growth. I want
to believe that its like programming, where the society is highly
meritocratic, so get the NERD on.

Anyways, if I compare it to design engineering now and within
Netherlands, how much will I earn? According to [payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/54000e8c/Entry-Level-Amsterdam) both
design engineering in eindhoven area and data scientist in Amsterdam
for entry level have same pay. Both seem rather accessible to me.

So I give it a 5 as well. 

There is no reason to look at jobs in US as getting them now would be
hard and already feels unrealistic for now.

**Personal fit**

Anyone can come into data science, we are not talking about data core
or machine learning. The skills are basically stats. 

I think the personal fit is also good here. I am up for challenging
jobs all the time. I love programming and can spend like any other
sane human being a very large time working on it. 

I think I can very well learn and get better at these skills over some
time. I could quickly do bootcamps from home and become good at DS. I
am a fast learner and have worked on proper programming assignments
before. I have done a bit of critical thinking, hypothesis forming and
solving problems. I love it to begin with and I think there is a lot
of room to get better and I can get better at it, with more defined
ways of thinking.

So I think I have some experience with it. I can already work with
python and I am young. I see this as a great fit for me. I feel that I
should be able to achieve great forms of success within DS if I stick
to it over my entire career. So I offer this a 93% chance of success.

I have solved problems at my work, I enjoy doing them.

- DS as a means of earning to give (Netherlands)

  100 to 200k is all far-fetched and possible in say US. For now we
  leave it outside the scope of this document.
  
  Just like in Design engineering, here I consider success to be able
  to go steadily on the DS journey in Netherlands. Picking up the
  career and being "successful" shall not be that hard. Being
  exceptional (not sure how to define it) will be the hard thing.
  
  I know a few of my colleagues who are in DS right out of the masters
  degree in some engineering. Plus from everything I have seen it is a
  learn-able skill, and appears to be definitely reachable.
  
  [10/10]


- Ds in startups

I will use the same numbers as in DE for this. [0.003/10]

- DS in NGO's

Here we could be talking. With good stats and quants capability, I
think we might have a good future here to do good.

There are NGO's which use DS to do good. Due to the skills I learn in
DS, I think I will be worthy as an analyst/DS at NGOs. If I spend
enough time, I could already manage a team and gain a large amount of
CC and try to work for NGO's

Success would be based on the following:

- Possibility of learning the right skills for the NGO work (80%)



**Impact**

An bachelor in some field in Facebook can earn (bachelors) 100k base
salary + 130k over 4 years equity. Wow. 

As far as I checked glassdoor and payscale, the pay in Netherlands
also seems to be higher than in . According to payscale DS's seem to earn[
53k](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/05582c7c/Amsterdam) and design engineers [40k](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Design_Engineer/Salary). I can easily find this out by
calling for a vacancy worst case. Not able to get proper estimates on
glassdoor, but it looks high. 

Also DS is heavily hyped by 80k hours for its ability to quickly turn
people in money making machines. 

>Data Incubator reports that its graduates can get starting salaries
>of $100K to $200K.

But I think some info that is missing is that these people who succeed
are not
ordinary people. The interview process is rigorous.

So I bring my expectations down a little bit as to whether I can be
those crazy achievers. back to ground 0 again. But I can apply and
see where I stand. 

So Assuming similar interest rates compounded and inflation as in DE,
I expect to save 365 lives. However if I work for top companies which
seems like a possibility, earning potential will be really good. If I
earn about 200k in 10 years, then the lives I will save will be ~500
lives. I see scope for tuning quite good here.

But, I think there is better chances of selling your self due to the
credentials earned. I am not able to scoop it out but, last time I saw
on glassdoor, experience here is valued a lot as opposed to Design
engineering.

>Most people move on to other jobs if they have more than 20 years'
>experience in this career. Experience has a moderate effect on pay
>for this job.- [Payscale-mechanical-engineering](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Engineer/Salary)

I am afraid the same holds for engineers in general, unless you
somehow move the ladder in management.

Where with DS, I don't see such warnings. 

I don't know how to measure its direct impact capabilities, but that
means I can either earn to give or work for NGOs, which has said
impact. and accordingly probabilities need to be processed.


There is a lot of scope for direct impact if one has skills, by using
this science in companies like:

>including the Center for Disease Control, Google, Khan Academy, Bayes
>Impact and DataKind.

I will assume all NGO's to have same impact for now.


**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

- I should be enjoying the work
- Cleaning up the data will be boring, it takes up a lot of time.
- Basic needs will be satisfied mostly (money, hours and commute)
- Am not worried I will have too many problems learning or fitting in, my point being it is
  not investment banking.
- Again I look up to people in the US like my brother and other actual
  data scientists, they seem to have time to do other things as
  well. Not like they are working 24x7.
- Also this is expected to be a very satisfying career according to
  80k, due to the feedback etc...

-Mentorship culture is quite common apparently according to 80k.

- project management is the fulfilling part of the career as all
analysts are just the right hand for project managers, just like my
DL.

Overall, I suspect the time to be a little more, but keeping the
bigger picture in mind, that I am learning potential skill every extra
hour I work, I shall not be cribbing about it then.

I will rank it as a result 1 point more than DE.

**Perceived ability to get a job**


#### Management consulting

Finishing an MBA allows travel into a couple of venues, of which one
of them is MC. 80k hours has done a [complete career profile on
them](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/). Based on [MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/), it appears that an MC does
just about anything that is needed to be done to improve the
performance of a company. The impression I get is that you are given
challenging problems and you have to come up with solutions for it.


**Skills**

Management consulting is hyped by 80k for its [career
capital](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/). They seem to offer sufficient transferable skills. You
actually work in different problems and become a generalist in an
industry.

>work in an industry you served as a consultant, venture capital,
>private equity, policy/civil service, work on a “strategy team” for a
>company. [Career Capital 80k hours](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/)


- Transferable skills 
  - personal productivity:8.5
  - Critical thinking, analysis and problem solving: 8
  - ability to learn quickly: 7.5
  - decision-making: 7
  - social skills: 4.0
  - management:6
- Knowledge: 8

- Personality traits
  - Confidence: 6.5
  

**Connections**

It is likely to become more valuable in the future. But it well known
that we will meet our clients atleast in MC. And we are given lot of
responsibility right from the
start.  

 
**Credentials**

I think with MC you will make good credentials. I suppose you are
solving problems after problems. The exit opportunities look aplenty,
so I guess just knowing this is good enough.

**Runway**

MC's earn [30-50% of what IB's earn](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/). At the associate level you
earn 80k to 170k. This would probably allow you to donate in the 30%
brackets. It should give enough runway right in the first year I
think assuming I do not have any more loans and shit.

**Personal fit**

>If the mean income of a hedge fund trader is $650,000, then that’s
>$20m over a 30 year career. If you donated half, that would be enough
>to cover the salaries of about 5 non-profit CEOs or 2-3 academic
>researchers, while still having a huge amount left to live on. 

- Earning to give

  - Chances of clearing getting >730 in GMAT (70%)
  - Chances of clearing the scholarship criteria for RSM after
    getting 740 (60%).
	
	Look at my history, I have never been the top
    performer, of course, I can hope for things to be different, but
    will it really be, of course I will put my heart and soul this
	time. 60% is already a lot I guess.
	
  - MC jobs are highly competitive and 80k suggest to attach a 50%
    probability with it.
	
  - Chances of staying within the chosen field >5 years (60%)
  - Chances that I will deal with 60 hrs of work (85%)
  
  - There is a 1/8th chance of making it to partner(12.5%) by age 45,
    which is pretty killer.
  
  So this makes it I barely see myself put the time and effort to make
  partner now but if I can make 600k + bonus, why not. Only 1/8th
  associates make partner anyway. As partner though you could earn a
  freaking lot. We will estimate the impact later. But this is a path
  then for earning-to-give and in case you crash and burn, you have
  exit opportunities #career-capital.
  
  So a total of :1.3% <!-- Investigate this whole idea of multiplying
  continuously, more the P numbers you have higher the chance of
  getting a super low number -->
  
- Earning to give once we leave industry after 5 years
  
  Similar chances apply except for 
  - Chances of moving to another industry due to stress or
    incapability (40%)
  - This would come to about 8%
  - If I was able to come this far, I assume from there on it is easy
    to get a job and advance more quickly in the industry. I don't
    know how much I can earn, but I suspect it is atleast around 150k,
    which is like a normal salary in the US. All the big boys in big
    companies are MBA's. So push furthere work hard and see where it
    takes us. I am not estimating anything more than that. 

>You can generally advance more quickly in industry by starting in
>consulting then entering industry several years later

- Starting up

I will use same chances as calculated before.

- Working for an NGO after 8 years

There are some chances of working say at the Gates Foundation or other
NGO's. But it is not a 100% clear how this would pan out. I assume the
same percentage of success as obtained earlier in DS.

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**
There is good feedback and training. Job satisfaction, although 60
hours needed can be gotten better than in IB and as we have
challenging projects it becomes more exciting. To me I am convinced,
that it will be challenging or overwhelming. 

Even if shit goes wrong try to sweat a few years and cash in on the
exit opportunities as possible.

**Impact**

- Earning to give (partner after 45)

	- At associate level we get 130k 
	- after 5 years 250k
	- after 7 years 450k
	- 600k + bonus after 7 more years say

We can expect to save 1448 lives

- Earning to give by once we leave industry

I will assume the mean earnings to be ~150k and from there on use a 5%
increase compounded and 12.5 % every 5 years to compute this
number. For some reason I assume the salary in US otherwise it
completely doesn't make sense at all to work in Holland for example. ~
840 lives. or if we compare it to the DS way of earning *1.3 lets say

- Exit after 5 years to something else

In 5 years we can save about 100-150 people, half of what can do in DE
or DS. But again these are salaries in the US. 

- Using skills earned to Startup

I would use the same impact as classified earlier

- Using skills earned to move to and NGO


<!-- What happens once you exit nah mean? What skills do you got? -->


**Exit opportunities**

If MC turns out to be not for you after a few years, then MC seems to
have decent exit opportunities. People move on to do various things,
not exactly like a demotion.

- Move to industry that you worked as a consultant 

>You can generally advance more quickly in industry by starting in
>consulting then entering industry several years later.

- policy/civil service but not sure how age plays a factor.
- VC / PE, If I can't handle MC and go to PE, then why will I choose
  PE, which seems to be even more demanding, depending on where you
  join.

#### IB/ Finance/ Trading/private equity 

	
**Skills**

Sufficient Exit opportunities in IB/PE. One can go to consulting or 

Skills in finance can apparently be earned within 6 months. After that
it is a mudane job.

 a PC most of the time and meeting clients does not happen very often
 especially within the first few years.
 
**Credentials**

I think with MC/IB you will make good credentials. MC it is clear that
one will make that

Assuming IB makes the same as PE and hedge funder
According to [80k-hours-trading](https://80000hours.org/2017/05/how-much-do-hedge-fund-traders-earn/), junior traders earn 300k - 3m per
year, this they reach within 8 years. More senior you get, the more
crazier it gets that Sr managers earn >10m$ "easily". 

Assuming average earnings of 800k over 30 years, it appears that one
can save 3771 lives.

With Management consulting one earns[ 30 to 50%](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/) less than people in IB,
ASsuming IB and trading get the same money, we can say that we
probably might save <2000 lives.


- Exit after 5 years to something else

In 5 years we can save about 100-150 people, half of what can do in DE
or DS. But again these are salaries in the US. 

- Using skills earned to Startup

I would use the same impact as classified earlier

- Using skills earned to move to and NGO

#### Machine learning PhD

Its possible to go for it, I guess, but I am not sure of so many
things, such as the skill required to get in in the first place. If at
all anything, I will start with DS and see how I can branch to ML or
Programming. In order to put say 1000 hrs of work, it would take me a
year atleast, and before that I am not sure anyone is interested in me
doing a PhD. But I can look at a masters followed by a PhD route. But
let's see. It's all right now too far-fetched to me.

#### Economics PhD

Too far-fetched, based on the link I studied. As I am already 27 and
it takes quite some effort to get to the point of applying. I don't
have the means or the scope to go into this any further. 

Everything can be as high but it is not really a personal fit at all.

#### Working @ effective non profits

As per the frequent words from 80k hours, working in an NGO should not
be the first thing to do for 2 reasons:

1. Experience is not really considered epic here

We rather learn much much more in the industry and then make the jump
to use our skills to make lives better.

2. Going to another job from here would be hard.

Going back to the industry would be hard. The skills that we gain in
the industry are much more valuable.

**Impact**
As a person working for an NGO like either GiveWell or 80k, the
estimated impact ranges from 600 to 3000 lives over 40 years. Another
estimate for an analyst informs that 1500 lives will be saved. To keep
things simple, we stick to this final number of 1500 lives over 40
years. It is assumed that the contribution of the Analyst and the
contribution of the operations/managers is the same for lack of
knowledge, hopefully leading to a conservative number. As we will be
spending the next 10 years prepping for it in essence, we would have
970 lives of impact.

#### Why not an MBA?

I suspect I am seeing signs and strong signs pointing me to do
otherwise. I think I need to clearly write it all out. It is an exit
strategy and thats all it is. Maybe you can do other things? Get in
touch with them people!

Amidst the above, examples of profiles without an MBA,
http://www.mercyforanimals.org/jobs doesn't require an MBA! But they
do need relavant experience, sometimes lilke, social sciences etc...

The places I am targetting appears that all I need is crazy as
motherfucking skill, thats it. interpersonal or whatever.

##  calculations
#### Impact calculations derivations
##### Calculating impact of direct working in 80k hours

**Problem**

80k hours has changed the lines of 1k people over 8 years. Per change
the cost is about 1337$. We seek to
estimate the contribution of an agent in case he joins 80k hours. 

**Assumptions or guesses**
80k is a reputed NGO, that is committed to create massive impact. It
is one such organization which I would want to join with the hopes of
creating large change.

They are about 15 people excluding advisors, 2 co-founders, 6 core
members, 3 freelancers and 4 operations people. 

My contribution would be 1.8% in the first year assuming my
contribution is [10%](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) of the co-founder, and core team 30% of
co-founder, management team 10% of co-founder each.

**Other factors**
- contribution of the donors
- Contribution of myself, incase someone else replaced me, how better
  I was than someone else


**Factors:**
- contribution of 80k compared to the total lives saved compared to
  people whose plan was changed (20%) (guess)
- contribution of 80k compared to donors (40%)(based on [GiveWell estimate](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/))
- contribution from me as compared to the contribution of my
  replaceable job as say an analyst or an operations person (10%) (
 [GiveWell estimate](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/))
- Contribution to me compared to other employees such as founders
  1.18% (as in assumptions and guesses)
- I estimate the number of lives saved in a my lifetime in my current
  normal job, by donating 15% as 222 lives (derived in the impact
  section of design engineering)
  
  Although I think 10% is a fair number to assume for donations, I
  suspect that with the change in plan based on 80k hours
  intervention, the impact could be atleast 1.5 times than what I
  could have done without 80k hours.
  
- Number of plans changed in a year = 457 on average and is growing
(last 2 years plans changed was >1k)

**The calculation**

- Number of lives saved would thus be: 457*222 lives per year

- Number of lives saved by me per year =  Multiplying by all factors
  with the number of lives saved in total per year= 10 lives
  
- If this grows compounded at 2% with 1% inflation in costs and a 10%
  interest every 5 years for the next 40 years, we get 626 lives.
  
**Reflection on the calculation**

- I feel like I have been heavily hoping for this answer to turn out
  ridiculously large say in k's of people saved. But its 2x more than
  what I could save just being a design engineer. I want to say JUST
  2x more. Nevertheless, I shall use these numbers, conservative as
  they may be.
  
- The numbers produced here seem conservative and very rough, with
  the estimates of my contribution as well as the number of
  plans changed (as we take average and not the current)
  
  Changing the numbers a bit, and making it less conservative, I
  stumble upon another rough estimate of about 2777 lives per
  lifetime per person.
  
  So I would say there is a possibility of saving 600 to 3000 lives
  over the next 40 years for me.
  
- Another estimate of value created in [$ @ GiveWell is $97,900](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) which
  translates to about 1500 lives roughly over 40 years (compounded at
  2% with 1% inflation in costs and a 10% interest every 5 years)
  
- I guess it is more about the ball park or the relatively larger good
  you can do by working in organizations such as GiveWell.
  
##### Calculating the impact of working in design engineering

I estimate the impact of being an engineer as
 - Total donations per annum (20% of 46k$)
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 40
 - Increase in salary = 4% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 10% increase
 - 20% donation per year
 - = <200
 
 
I estimate the impact of starting up in tech to be
 - Total donations per annum (60% of [2.5m$](https://80000hours.org/2014/05/how-much-do-y-combinator-founders-earn/#fn:5))
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 40
 - Increase in salary = 5% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 12.5% increase
 - ~38k lives
 
## Plan

This post is going to serve as a summary, before I apply to 80k
hours. I see an stm talk about 21k words etc... on his wall.

For me the problem with so many words is having to rewrite the whole thing(not
motivating), 

But I see time and again that he is trying to write a lot. Somehow, for some
reason he belives that writing is everything, or writing helps in solving what
he wants!

#### IB

[Rubin and Archer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ibMt0kQiw)were analysts quit IB for the following reasons:

- Despite putting 80-100 hrs/ week they still had to kiss ass,
  sometimes it doesn't make 
  
- Exit options are good apparently

- Mundane, not really, mainly ppts.

- Work goes unnoticed if kissing ass is not done 

- pretend to do work, when there is no work

- Very competitive

- Can learn the finance skills in 6 months.

- analyst to associate almost needs in MBA go in private equity and
  hedge funds (500k$)
  
- MBA for higher ups anyway most people.

- The skills you learn in IB can be got within 6 months (finanacial modelling), you don't
  really need to spend years working here to gain the skills
  
- Pure skills might be more freaking valuable or business skills that
  will allow you to scale a company from the ground up
 
- POlitics Bonus... 

- Pretend to do work... 

- Whether they like you are not. Unhealthy!

- They might not use your work everything you sacrificed. 

- He missed his cousins wedding and they still took the name out of
the book he made.

- If you focus on Statups and gaining crazy skill, then you will get
equity. and a fulfilling career. Stick to this part of the game.

What is IB?

Supporting companies that do mergers. Nothing sexy. As analysts
support the bbuying selling of companies, raising capital etc...

What do they do Day to Day?

There is an organizational schematic. The associate will drop at 7pm
in the evening a task of making 100 pages of document within the next
morning with good graphs and stuff that the higher ups can deal with.

Do market research, projections on excel what the company can
	buy... they present the ppt and engage as advisor. 1-2 months
	
Is IB fun?

Everybody is super excited. 100 hrs a week, not working on models
every week, lot of politics, youre even changing font colors on
things.

Lot of analysts use IB as a stepping stone finance and the corporate
world... exit opportunities. Hedge funds and private equity after 3
years. I am not sure I am 

21 years-  80-90k base ...signing bonus 10k ... bonus at the end of
the year...  75% to 100% of annual salary. 150 to 200 k ... By the 3rd
year you could make 250k . 150k easily @ 22 years. 100 hrs a week.


Exit opportunities: 

looks good on the resume.... good for MBA to exit to


Avg day: 8 to 9 am start.. 3-4 deals... need ppt by 3pm.. do
stuff... models draft by 2pm... follow up work for to other
things...until 7 pm. 

After that... you sometimes have to work until 2am and even drop off
the stuff at your MD's house. if you go to sleep at 6 am you are still
expected to come back to work at 10am. (get out of here)

Doesn't happen everyday, but it does happen. NO Weekends

168 hrs - 100 hrs work -40 hrs sleep = 28 hrs!

They have breaking into startups.

## Who earns the most

People in management law or Finance


## Consultant

X-BCG employee is glamourous?



## MBA

There are couple of things one can do after an MBA, such as management
consulting, Investment Banking Private Equity, Hedge Funds, Trading. 

I barely have a clue of what each of this is. 

In [this post](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/152549/working-for-mckinsey-bain-and-boston-consulting-vs-goldman-jpm-and-morgan-stanley) the difference between an IB'er and an MC't is
seen. 

> Investment banking (IB) denotes a financial service that creates
> capital for individuals and organizations, according to one
> definition. Investment bankers (i-bankers, or just “bankers”) give
> investors counsel on market strategies that can minimize their risks
> and maximize their returns. They provide assistance for mergers,
> acquisitions, and restructuring. Risk management is a major part of
> the i-banker job. - [MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/)


>A management consultant (MC) provides expert advice to businesses on
>operations, restructuring, and cost reduction. They are called upon
>to create strategies to help companies make a turnaround. They look
>at what their client companies have been doing and suggest what they
>can do to perform better. MCs deal with different types of problems
>and, for example, may be called upon to suggest to a marketing team
>how to improve its product delivery or advise HR people how to create
>a new health plan for employees.-[MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/)

It is clear from the above that one majors in Finance and the other
just in about anything to help a company get back or improve. MC's are
generally generalists, but somehow in the end are working for a
particular type of industry. 

Job satisfaction is expected to be better in MC than in IB, and the
hours are not that bad as in IB. Sometimes we work weekends, sometimes
not. IB in addition to all this shit, needs Facetime and 

Pay in MC is about 30-50% of an IB'er.

Pay in MC is detailed [here](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/nl-en/246284/work-in-management-consulting-how-much-you-will-make-at-mckinsey-bcg-and-bain). It appears that at Mckinsey one
earned in the year of 2017 an average salary of 140k. Which basically
a high performing engineer in apple can doing DS. [80k says a similar
salary for an associate as well (80 to 170k)](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/)

**PE** is usually seen as an exit opportunity for IB. I googled what
it is and found some finance jargon and I leave it at that. PE can be
as bad as IB in terms of hours clocked or not depending on somethings,
but the pay gets even higher than in IB is my understanding according
to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ibMt0kQiw). People usually work for a few years in IB and then
move on to PE. PE apparently has more interesting work. Hours are
better when deals are not being made. But if in the middle of the deal
16 hours. But PE hours for juniors might still be punishingly
hard. Pay is same apparently according to [this source](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/nl-en/178146/honest-account-working-promised-land-private-equity), but
somehow the environment is better and chances of a burn out are
less. The hours still look bad according to this [quora post](https://www.quora.com/Whats-it-like-to-work-in-private-equity).

**Hedge funds**

 So you start at a company
and based on the amount of success you add, you get a corresponding
compensation. So in the beginning years it is not really high as you
need time to learn the tricks of the game. 

>We found that junior traders typically earn $300k – $3m per year, and
>it’s possible to reach these roles in 4 – 8 years. Senior portfolio
>managers can easily earn over $10m per year,-[80khours-hedgefunds](https://80000hours.org/2017/05/how-much-do-hedge-fund-traders-earn/)

- Money is crazy. 
- Hours are not as bad as in IB (50-60hrs). Apparently as the job
  revolves around capital markets and market closes.

As pleasant as that may sound, a brief view of what happens as [shown
here](http://www.lifeonthebuyside.com/buy-side-analyst-good-bad-day/) wants you to get away from this as well. I cannot deal with
these things knowingly that they will happen some time. I am not cut
out for this, I think. I have hated it always and I would liek to add
value in a different way.

In all of these programs it is to be understood that there is crazy
competition and you need to be the best of the best. Also there is the
possibility of market crashing affecting you. With all the stress I
doubt I will be able to eat sometimes, or go to the gym even.

#### chances hedge fund
Earnings need to be corrected for chances of leaving a job to more
operational roles, future prospects of industry and personal fit.

How do I want to make the excel sheet with all the numbers?

I think I should just keep Design Engineering earning to give, DEsign
engineering building skills to work in an NGO.

And when I talk about startups or working in startups after 5 years of
work around here, I can make contributions due to
DE,DS,MC, etc... Most likely I think they will be the same, but I will
do it there. OK?

That settles it.
