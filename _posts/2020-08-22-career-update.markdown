## Feedback from an STM

In the [last essay](/the-last-dance-career.html) I had looked at the impact of Data Science (DS)
career vs an EA career. I hadn't looked at the lifetime calculations
which seems to be a better indicator. For example, 8 years of grind
from 30 and then ending up with a high-pay job, might still be better
than taking a less risky but lower-paying job.

Also, at the end of the essay I concluded that I was going to switch
to DS in the coming 6 months and then get back to focusing on EA. This
I did without really looking at what sort of impact it had on the
lifetime impact.

With this essay, I hope to address the above issues.

## Introduction

Many people I know in FAANG are making 300k TC after 4-6 years of
experience, be it in antenna design or Data Science or CS. Having seen
examples of Jeff Kaufman being able to donate 50% (150k), there seems
to be "great" potential with a FAANG job.

On the other hand EA also claims to have lots of impact. With Milan
Griffes' estimate [here](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/), on how just as an entry level researcher
he is able to make contributions to the extent of 93k dollars, it
seems to hold a lot of promise.

I am thus intrigued by both these paths as options for a
"high-impact-career" and would like to compare these two over a life
time and particularly for my scenario.

With this essay we look at the following scenarios:

1. Start with a DS job, find a masters in the US and somehow get into
   FAANG and donate X% everyear. This also includes the fall back
   option of coming back to NL for whatever reason (recession, getting
   fired etc.) and continuing DS in NL for the rest of my life.
   
2. Start with a DS job, and instead of taking the masters route to the
   US, I will try the L1 route. The rest is the same as in 1.
   
3. Try, in the coming 4-5 years to become a GiveWell Researcher while
   working in DS in NL, and the fall back option being, to pursue the
   L1 path in DS and if that fails, back to NL in DS.

4. Try in the coming 4-5 years to become a Charity Entrepreneur, and the
   fall back option being to pursue DS through the L1 path and if that
   fails back to NL in DS.

**Why GiveWell?**

GiveWell is a "highly respected" organization among the EA
community. Their impact is very clear with their cost-effectiveness
estimates and their money moved to other organizations. This allows me
to compare impact with other scenarios. If for example I took MIRI or
Open Phil, then I really don't have such estimates to make
comparisons.

GiveWell can be in theory substituted with anything else that holds
similar or larger impact.

**4-5 years is arbitrary**

From [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but) I get some estimates of how long people spent trying to
move into EA be it in research or entrepreneurship. It is in the order
of 2-5 years. If I don't get it in that time then I assume I should
stop trying.

**Why DS?**

I am going to focus on DS instead of CS, for DS involves "critical
thinking", working with statistics, working with claims, hypothesis
testing etc.--things that seem to help become a better EA researcher.
In the case that I am trying to be a researcher while I have a day DS
job, my learnings in DS seem to aid my trying to be a researcher, and
vice versa. Also Earning potential wise, it appears there is not "much
difference" ([looking at the average salaries](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/which-is-more-promising-data-science-or-software-engineering-7e425e9ec4f4) of `137k$`). So we
stick with DS.

**Why US?**

Earning potential is quite high in the US. Earnings are substantially
larger than here in Netherlands (or Europe). I know DS people with
4yoe in Apple California earning 300k`$` TC and others in Walmart with
300k`$` TC. While here (Netherlands) people seem to be [earning
78k-103k$](https://www.glassdoor.nl/Salarissen/Booking-com-Data-Scientist-Amsterdam-Salarissen-EJI_IE256653.0,11_KO12,26_IL.27,36_IM1112.htm?experienceLevel=ONE_TO_THREE) as per Glassdoor. With such salaries as in the US there
are people like ([Jeff Kaufman](https://www.jefftk.com/donations)) who are able to donate 50%. This
amounts to about 150k`$` per year with a 300k`$` TC.

There are 2 ways many people I know take, to get to the US. People
take the masters route, and then work towards an H1B visa which allows
you to work there. The other route is the L1 route. In this case you
work in say Amazon in India (for e.g.,) and then try to move to the US
on an L1.

**Why Research, why not operations?**

I think I am capable of doing research more than operations. Rather,
the journey to an EA job in research can be done from home. For
Research I know of [examples of people](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but) who got a position in EA
orgs by writing at the EA forum, critically evaluating other orgs'
work, and working on themselves on the side. For operations the path
doesn't seem to be direct. If you look at [Tanya's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanya-singh-08b36a65/) profile you see
that she has some different types of management experience for a few
years and then turns to FHI for a position. I would need to take some
chances and try some management positions and try to be best at it and
maybe that pays off, maybe.

Being a researcher doesn't mean you can't be a co-founder one day or
grow into management positions in EA orgs. Research is only the start,
it appears that they are capable of growing to even [MD level
positions](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-berger-58906098/) (higher impact than researcher) or [co-founder
level](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-griffes/).

In the coming sections we look at the lifetime calculations of the
different scenarios.

## Scenario 1: DS with Masters in the US

![DS-masters](./images/career/DS-masters.png "This is blab la blab")


The above decision tree shows the different parts expected on the
"DS-masters" route. I would start with a DS job in Netherlands, find
my way into a university, paying my tuition, fighting with the odds of
getting fired, get an H1B and then hopefully a FAANG job, working till
65 without getting fired.

As a backup, in case I fail, I can always go back to Netherlands to
pick myself up and continue DS there, albeit the smaller donation
capability (shown later).

### The Probabilities

The following table shows the different crossroads and probabilities
(Success/Other) associated with them. And the last line repeats itself
until I am 65 when I would need to retire.

| Year/age | Crossroad                                          | Success | Other |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| 30       | Get a DS job in NL                                 | 95%     | 5%    |
| 34       | Finishing master's and Getting job                 | 62%-71% | 29%   |
| 34-39    | Paying back the tuition debt                       | 100%    | 0%    |
| 34       | Not moving back due to recession or general firing | 96%     | 4%    |
| 35       | Not moving back due to recession or general firing | 96%     | 4%    |
| 36       | Not moving back due to recession or general firing | 96%     | 4%    |
| 37       | Get H1B within OPT                                 | 58%     | 42%   |
| 37       | Get FAANG job                                      | 90%     | 10%   |
| 37       | Not moving back due to recession or general firing | 96%     | 4%    |

The chance of **Getting a DS job in NL** in the next 1 year seems
"high" to me. I have seen a couple of people who have moved to DS from
TU Delft where they did their master's in engineering in "sustainable
energy" and moved to DS. A more relatable story is of [this girl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vpparab/),
who did bachelor's in Mechanical (similar to mine) and then moved to a
master's in TU Delft and moved into DS within a few months of
graduating. She seems to have done a Coursera course, R and some
python assignments in the mean time.

Also, everyone works in DS, right from computer scientists to people
who did their [bachelor's in Psycology and political
science](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhurford8/). [This guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashankmaiya/) with a PhD in Electrical Engineering spent
8 months at a DS school in his weekends to transfer to DS in the
US. As a result I think there is a high chance to **Get a DS job in
NL**. I have placed this probability at `95%`.

**Finishing master's and getting job (recession or not)** 

Everyone I know has managed to get into a US university of their
capability in a time that is not recession and ended up staying in the
US with a job. I would guess that this number is around 20-40
people. Three people from that lot did come back to India but that was
because of not getting the H1B Lottery (which is accounted for
separately and not in this probability). Thus, I place the probability
of finishing master's and getting a job @ `70-80%`. If its a recession
like now, then the chances of getting a job after finishing master's
is assumed to be `0%` which might be a "tad conservative".

The world has had about [8 recessions in a span of 70 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States).
Chance of recession in a given year seems to thus be `8/70=11.4%`. So
taking this into account, the chance of "**Finishing master's and
getting a job in the US (recession or not)**", is `(1-11.4%)x(70% to
80%)+11.4%x0%`=`62% to 71%`.

**Paying back tuition fees**:  
Doing a master's costs money in the form of tuition and living
expenses while studying. As soon as one starts his education the debt
opens. I don't expect any scholarship. Hence, this is placed at
`100%`.

**Not moving back due to recession or general firing**

In the US it is quite possible that you loose your job in the time of
recession or get fired from your regular job with little or no notice.
This means that you have to scavenge for a job within the next 60 days
and if you don't end up finding a job you are kicked out of the
country. This has bad implications for life time impact as this would
mean going back to NL and working from there, where salaries are not
comparable to that of the US.

A proxy for the "**chance of getting canned during recession**" seems
to be in this website which tracks the startups that are laying off
people. I assume the median % of layoffs in these companies as my
"chance of getting canned during recession" in any company. This seems
conservative, in the sense that not all companies are going to layoff
people during recession (e.g., FAANG in the current pandemic). This is
`22%` according to [layoffs.fyi](https://airtable.com/shrqYt5kSqMzHV9R5/tbl8c8kanuNB6bPYr?backgroundColor=green&viewControls=on).

The "**chance of moving back to Netherlands, as a result of loosing my
job in non-recession time**" seems to be "really low". Of the people I
know who are living in the US and working in tech, some of them have
gotten fired, and all of them have bounced back within the 60 day
period. I thus put the chance of being canned during non-recession
times as `2%` for given year (while US unemployment rates during start
of 2020 was \<4%).

Thus the total chance of **NOT Moving back to NL due to recession or
some general firing** is `(1-11.4%)x(1-2%)+11.4%x(1-22%)`=`96%`.

**Getting an H1B Visa**: The next hurdle to be crossed is that of
**Getting an H1B visa** through the lottery process. There seems to be
a `58%` chance that a person with a switching background will clear
this hurdle [^2]. This is including atleast 3 tries at H1B (i.e., 1-3
years of applying for the Lottery). The detailed reasoning and
citations are in the footnotes [^2].

With this all the probabilities used are covered for the DS Master's
path.

### Effective Value

With calculations for 3 different types of impacts, and the above
probabilities it is possible to complete the decision tree and end up
with an effective value as shown [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=1703661868) in Google sheets. The 3
different impacts are:

1. Failure impact: Lifetime impact calculations from the time of
failure (@ above "crossroads") until retirement.
   
2. Success impact: Lifetime impact calculations if we face success (@
   above "crossroads") all the time.
   
3. Additional significant costs that come into the picture such as
   tuition etc...
   

**Failure Impact**

The failure option for any point in the decision tree would be to go
back to NL and pursue DS ("DS NL" in decision tree) from the time of
leaving US till retirement (and donate what is possible). The
following variables are used to compute the **DS NL** impact.

| Variables                    | Value   |
|------------------------------|---------|
| Base salary NL at Start year | $60,000 |
| Const. Growth Rate           | 3%      |
| Average Donation %           | 15%     |
| Start year                   | 30      |
| End year (Retirement)        | 65      |

NL is pretty stable. While US unemployment rates have gone up to [14%
from 3.5% at the beginning of the year](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate#:~:text=Unemployment%20Rate%20in%20the%20United,percent%20in%20May%20of%201953.), in NL those rates have at
max reached [4.5% during recession from 3.5% at the beginning of the
year](https://tradingeconomics.com/netherlands/unemployment-rate#:~:text=Unemployment%20Rate%20in%20Netherlands%20averaged,percent%20in%20February%20of%202020.). It is thus assumed that I wont get fired, till I retire and
will have a constant but slow growth rate (3% as observed where I
work) in Netherlands.

Regarding donations, I think 15% is hard to do in the first ten
years. I am currently able to do 10%. This leaves me with just over
15% for saving and vacations (36% taxes, 36% food and rent etc., 10%
donation). Every Euro I earn extra from now on, is taxed at 50%
along. Keeping expenses same and increasing savings and vacation
expenses by 5%--between now and 10 years later--I estimate that I can
increase the donation to 15% only after 10 years. 

So in the first 10 years sticking to 10% and in the last 10 years
going as far as 20% might be an option. So I think 15% on average over
lifetime should be doable with a bit of effort. Further optimization
is possible but we move on.

In case I don't get a US university for some reason am stuck in
Netherlands as a result, then expected life time donation is around
`560k$` based on years 32 to 65.

**Success Impact**

The following are the variables chosen to calculate the life time
impact associated with working in DS in California:

| Variables                    |          |
|------------------------------|----------|
| Base salary US at Start year | $150,000 |
| Growth rate                  | 6%       |
| Average Donation %           | 30%-40%  |
| Start year                   | 34       |
| End year                     | 65       |


I assume the average growth rate is 6% on average (based on [2016 to
2019 growth of Jeff Kaufman](https://www.jefftk.com/money) which is after \~8 years of
experience).

In the first years I doubt I can do more than 10%. In the last 10
years of my career I guess I can do way more than 30%. I expect to
make 300k TC 8-10 years after I start the job. I will have about 100k
per month to spend in-hand (based on this [net-salary calculator](https://www.calculator.net/take-home-pay-calculator.html?cannualincome=300000&cpayfrequency=Annual&cfilestatus=Single&cchildren=0&cotherdep=0&cnonjobincome=0&chelddeduction=9000&cnothelddeduction=0&citemdeduction=100000&chasotherjobincome=no&cjobincome2=0&cjobincome3=0&cstatetax=13.3&ccitytax=0&cselfemployed=no&printit=0&x=0&y=0))
after a 30% donation. This seems to be quite a lot considering people
in EA orgs are able to live on \<100k gross salary in
California. Maybe I can push it to 40%, like a higher limit. If I end
up with success at all crossroads, then it is expected to have `4m$`
to `5m$` in expected donations by 65, based on average donation of
`30%-40%`.

**Additional Costs**

Costs of program in a public university and the cost of living during
that time is expected to be 70k for 2 years for California State
University. This I gather from someone who is doing their master's
there. I use this for now.

**Lifetime Impact**

Filling in the above values into the google sheets shown [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=1703661868),
estimates the Lifetime impact of the DS Master's path. It is expected
to vary from `713k` to `865k`. With my "best-guess-estimate" as
`731k`. The `sheets` value only shows the "best-guess-estimate".


## Scenario 2: DS with L1


![DS-L1](./images/career/DS-L1.png)

The above decision tree shows the different parts expected on the
"DS-L1" route. I would start with finding a company that would allow
me to transfer to US in due course on an L1 visa. I allow myself about
4 years to mastermind this. Once I go to the US I would need to focus
on plans to get to an H1B as the L1 is tied to the company and lasts
for only 5 years.

As a backup, in case I fail, I can always go back to the Netherlands
to pick myself up and continue DS there, albeit the smaller donation
capability. 

### The probabilities

The following is part of the decision tree for what I expect to happen
if I choose the "DS L1 route".   

| Year/age | Crossroad                                           | Success | Other |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| 30       | Did not find DS job in L1-able company in NL        | 50%     | 50%   |
| 32       | Found DS job in L1-able company in NL               | 50%     | 50%   |
| 34       | Get L1 and go to US                                 | 72%     | 28%   |
| 34       | Not  moving back due to recession or general firing | 96%     | 4%    |
| 34-39    | Paying back the tuition debt                        | 100%    | 0%    |
| 35       | Not  moving back due to recession or general firing | 96%     | 4%    |
| 36       | Not  moving back due to recession or general firing | 96%     | 4%    |
| 36       | Finding H1-able company                             | 100%    | 0%    |
| 37       | Get H1B or move back                                | 58%     | 42%   |
| 38       | Not moving back due to recession or general firing  | 96%     | 4%    |


In this path I need to first find an L1-able company. A company that
will allow me to move to the US on an L1-visa. There are examples I
have come across, across fields and countries. There are people who
went all the way to JP Morgan in New York on an L1 after a few years
in India and [SWe engineers from India who are now in
FAANG](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramshandilya/). Atleast for mechanical background, people from ASML
Netherlands regularly work in the US for a few years on L1. It seems
"accessible". I am really unsure how to approach such a thing for DS
and from Netherlands. I have to look into the possibilities more for
DS people in Netherlands. Say `50%` chance--much lesser than the
chance of "finding a job in the US in DS after a master's" (80%). This
is modeled as 2 chances for **finding an L1-able company** (as seen in
the decision tree).

Even if I find an L1-able company the USCIS needs to approve it. [This
approval rate declined to 72% in fiscal 2019](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/71978362.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst). This is used in the
decision tree.

It appears that you increase your chances of getting an H1B from `42%
to 58%`[^2] (over 3 attempts) if you have a "US accredited
Master's". Even in the L1 path I would like to pursue an online
master's atleast to increase chances of staying in the US. Hence the
**Paying back tuition debt** "crossroad".

With an L1, there seems to be some push back from companies trying to
take you in through an H1B. A friend while applying to companies while
he was in L1 informs me that companies didn't want him because he was
on an L1. This was apparently so, as the company can only apply in
April for H1B and furthermore needs to wait until a decision is
received a few months later before that person on L1 is able to
start. A way around this seems to be to not inform the companies of
your visa status and focus on doing really well in the interview and
informing them later about the visa. To factor this in, a multiplying
factor of `80-100%` is used at crossroad: "**Finding H1-able company**".

The rest of the probabilities are similar to that in the previous
scenario.

### Effective Value calculations

The exact same impact calculations from the DS master's path on
failure impact, additional costs and success is used here as well. The
decision tree in sheets can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=1336986854).

**Lifetime Impact**

Filling in the above values in the google sheets estimates the life
time impact of the `DS L1 path` to vary from `642k$` to `875k$`, with
my "best-guess estimate" at `642k$`

## Scenario 3: Working as a researcher

![GW](./images/career/GW.png)

The above decision tree shows the different parts expected along the
"GiveWell Researcher" route. I would start by applying to GiveWell and
working on improving myself in the next 4 years. Hopefully this gets
me into GiveWell. From there on it can be anything such as growing in
position or sticking to research or even starting up based on the
research done so far.

### The probabilities

The following table shows the different crossroads and
probabilities(Success/other) associated with them. And the last line
repeats itself until I am 65 when I would need to retire.

| Year/age | Crossroad                                          | Success | Other   |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| 30       | Did not get into GW                                | 99%     | 1%      |
| 32       | Did not get into GW                                | 80%     | 20%-30% |
| 34       | Got into GW                                        | 60%     | 40%     |
| 34       | Not moving back due to recession or general firing | 96%     | 4%      |

The general chance of getting into GiveWell or for that matter any EA
org is quite low just looking at the number of people apping for
it. For example, the acceptance rate for a GR at Open Phil was less
than 5% of the people who applied in 2018. At the moment I am sure I
am not GiveWell material. I didn't get two internships with Happier
Lives Institute and Charity Entrepreneurship which informs me that I
atleast need to work on myself. However HLI informed me that my
internal validity assessment, for one of their tests was "one of the
best", but I still doubt that I could fend myself in a 1 on 1
in-person interview. In a few years I can "build the skills" through
DP hopefully and see where that gets me. I guess based on this, that
there is a `1%` chance of me getting in now, a `20-30%` chance that I
get in after 2 years of work, and a `60%` chance that I make it in 4
years from now.

The chance that I don't have to move back to NL and pursue other
options either due to recession or general firing, is assumed to be
the same as was the case with `DS master's` and `DS-L1` routes. So a
`96%` chance.

### Effective Value

To compute the effective value we need the following in addition to
the probabilities above.

1. Success impact: Lifetime calculations if faced with success all the
   time in the decision tree.

2. Failure impact: What happens when I don't get into GiveWell. What
   is going to be the impact.
   
**Failure impact**:

I assume that if I fail before 40 years I still can give DS L1 route a
go, and if that fails, then 'DS in NL'. Post 40 I just assume that I
can only do 'DS in NL' for the rest of my life. These numbers are
calculated based on the same variables as estimated in `DS-master's`.
   
**Success Impact**

Lifetime impact of working in an EAO is calculated based on
[GiveWell's 2015 impact post](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/05/givewells-progress-in-2015/). GiveWell moved 110m`$` in 2015. But
the amount that is to be associated with the researcher is much
less. How much is it? The values used are shown in the table
below. The explanation of the values used is below table
 
| Variables                                          |              |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Total amount moved in 2015 by GW                   | $110,000,000 |
| Amount Attributed to Researcher as % of co-founder | 10%          |
| No. of co-founders                                 | 9            |
| Counterfactual contribution of Researcher          | 5%-15%       |
|                                                    |              |
| ~~Amount Attributed to GW (shapely values)~~       | ~~33%~~      |
| Counterfactual contribution of GW                  | 37%          |
|                                                    |              |
| Additional Base Counterfactual ETG                 | $3,500       |
|                                                    |              |
| Growth Rate Attributed to the Researcher           | 8%           |
| Growth Rate Attributed to Counterfactual ETG       | 3%           |
|                                                    |              |
| Start Year                                         | 34           |

An entry level researcher's contribution is expected to be [10% of a
co-founder](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/05/givewells-progress-in-2015/) in 2015. GiveWell employed [9 co-founders](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/05/givewells-progress-in-2015/) that
year. So we get a multiplying factor of `10%/9` on the total money
moved in 2015 (110m`$`). But that is not enough it appears.

There seems to be two schools of thought when it comes to assessing
impact when multiple agents are involved. One is through [shapely
values as motivated here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHZJ9i7QBtAJZ6byW/shapley-values-better-than-counterfactuals) and the other is through [counterfactual
impact as explained here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EP8x3vHRQJP57TjFL/the-counterfactual-impact-of-agents-acting-in-concert). I think I should use counterfactual
impact as that captures how much impact my action "truly" has, compared
to doing nothing. 

~~**Shapely Values**: Just like we divide the impact of the org among
the different people working in the org, it seems appropriate that we
should also divide the impact of the 110m that GiveWell moves, among
the following: the Donors (e.g., Good Ventures), the middle men
(GiveWell) and the intervention Orgs (AMF). The impact from the
110m`$` seems to belong to each of these Orgs. *I assume* all Orgs
have equal weight in this, for lack of any other better estimate. So
we get a multiplying factor `0.33`.~~



**Counterfactual impact of the org itself**

It "seems likely" that if GiveWell was not formed by the 2 co-founders
in 2007 then someone else would have (perhaps a few years later). The
reason this is being said is because there are many orgs that today,
try to work with "cost-effectiveness ideas" trying to do the
"most-good" to identify interventions that are worthy to put money
in. There are many orgs such as Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE), Open
Philanthropy Project (OPP), Happier Lives Institute (HLI), Charity
Science Health (CSH), Charity Entrepreneurship (CE), The Life You Can
Save (TLC'S) (that formed between 2010 and 2020). Thus for the
hypothetical situation I would imagine a "GiveWell-like" org being
formed say 7 years later by people who founded the above listed Orgs.

The two scenarios are actual: GiveWell forms in 2007; And
hypothetical: GiveWell-like org forms in 2014.

For example in 2007,

*Actual Scenario in 2007*: GiveWell moves `2.4m$` to charities with
cost-effectiveness 7 (in 2018 it was [18](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=1202275292&range=E10), so 7 seems
conservative).

*Hypothetical Scenario in 2007*: `2.4m$` moved to "other-orgs" with
much lesser cost-effectiveness of 1 (assumed, this is as good as GD) +
`292k$` used run the 2 people organization with cost-effectiveness of
1 + `100k$` Earning-To-Give by the co-founders which goes to orgs say
with cost-effectiveness of 5 (they started GiveWell in the actual
scenario, might have had beet use for their money).

Throughout money associated with GiveWell is assumed to be moved with
a cost-effectiveness of 7 while others are assumed to be moved with a
cost-effectiveness of 1 (i.e., cost-effectiveness of Give Directly).

This is continued in the [Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=1579800708) until 2037 when it is
assumed GiveWell stops, in the actual scenario. And in the hypothetical
scenario it stops 7 years later.

In order to compare the two scenarios, we multiply the dollars with
cost-effectiveness and add it up for each scenario per year. We then
compute the Net Present Values as of 2007 for actual scenario and
hypothetical scenario. For the future years from 2007 we assume a
discount rate of 5%. We assume that GiveWell continues producing value
until 2037 in the actual scenario. So in the hypothetical scenario the
"the GiveWell-like" org produces value from 2014 to 2044.

How much GiveWell moves (from 2007 for the actual scenario and from
2014 for the hypothetical scenario) is taken from [it's
website](https://www.givewell.org/about/impact). For example, in 2018 GiveWell moves `125m$`. So, in the
hypothetical scenario in 2025 the GiveWell-like org is expected to
move the same `125m$`, i.e., with a 7 year delay.

The outcome seems conservative as the cost-effectiveness estimates for
the actual scenario is assumed to be a factor 2 atleast smaller
(cost-effectiveness for 2018 is 18 while we assume throughout that the
cost-effectiveness is just 7 for GiveWell moved money). Also, in the
actual scenario, the impact of the people founding GiveWell-like org
is assumed to be 0.

The counterfactual impact is thus estimated to be `37%` better than the
hypothetical scenario.

**Counterfactual estimates of the researcher**

Counterfactual estimates for the value created by a person is the
difference between utility created when he exists and the utility
created when he doesn't exist. Say the job creates an impact of
X`$`. If you are completely replaceable, i.e., there is no utility
difference whether you are there or not, then your value per year is
0k`$`. If you are not replaceable at all, i.e., there is a job only
you can do and if you don't take it up, no one will do it, then you
get all of the impact from the job (all of X`$`).

It appears that how good you are compared to the last person you
displace defines how much impact you will have. The explanation is as
follows:

There are two scenarios `Scenario WITH` and `Scenario WITHOUT` as
shown in the table below. In `Scenario WITH`:

- `AA` to `II` people exist
- `AA` to `FF` work in EAO. 
- `GG` to `JJ` do ETG in `Scenario WITH`. 

When `AA` is removed, you get the `Scenario WITHOUT`: 

- The whole chain is expected to displace up.  
- `GG` moves to work in EA and his ETG is lost unfortunately.

`A`, `B`, ... `I` refer to the contribution of `AA`, `BB`, .... `II`
in an EA job with impact `EA`. *Here we assume all EA jobs have the
same impact,* `EA` (makes the calculation simpler), and we quickly see
that the Counterfactual Impact (CI) = `A-G x EA + ETG by GG`.

Assuming `AA` managed to get a job in GiveWell, and GG was just not
good enough to get the meritocraticaly last job in EA, then I expect
`AA` to be atleast 10% "better" than `GG`. `AA` produces 10% more
"impact" than `GG` for the same number of years worked per salary
units. For calculations we assume variation between `5%-15%` with best
guess at `10%`.

{:.tablestyletwo}
| Impact | Scenario WITH | Scenario WITHOUT | Difference            |
|--------|---------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| EA1    | AA            | BB               | A-B x EA              |
| EA2    | BB            | CC               | B-C x EA              |
| EA3    | CC            | DD               | C-D x EA              |
| EA4    | DD            | EE               | D-E x EA              |
| EA5    | EE            | FF               | E-F x EA              |
| EA6    | FF            | GG               | F-G x EA              |
|        |               |                  |                       |
| ETG1   | GG            | 0                | ETG by GG             |
| ETG2   | HH            | HH               | 0                     |
| ETG3   | II            | II               | 0                     |
| Total  | -             | -                | A-G x EA +  ETG by GG |


And `GG` being an EA is expected to donate 10% of his/her
salary. Typical passionate EAs seem to donate 10% of their income. If
they are from US this would be in the order of 20k with a 200k salary
let's say. If they are in the EU it would be in the order of 3-10k
(which I see as feasible). I assume for now that `GG` is from the EU
and hence suggest that his/her base donation would be around `3.5k$`
(**Additional Base Counterfactual ETG**). To count the lifetime impact
we need growth rates. Typical growth rates I see in Netherlands are
`3%`. I will stick to that for `GG` aka **Growth rate Attributed to
Counterfactual ETG**

**Growth Rate attributed to Researcher**

Over a lifetime I find it hard to believe that one will be stuck at
`10%` of the co-founder contribution. With time one would move up the
ladder and so we assume a growth rate of `8%` on this 10%. This
implies that you will end up doing 46% as that of a co-founder after
20 years of experience, and 100% after 30 years of experience. This
seems reasonable to me. 

The following is the summary:

| Variables                                          |              |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Total amount moved in 2015 by GW                   | $110,000,000 |
| Amount Attributed to Researcher as % of co-founder | 10%          |
| No. of co-founders                                 | 9            |
| Counterfactual contribution of Researcher          | 5%-15%      |
|                                                    |              |
| ~~Amount Attributed to GW (shapely values)~~       | ~~33% ~~     |
| Counterfactual contribution of GW                  | 37%          |
|                                                    |              |
| Additional Base Counterfactual ETG                 | $3,500       |
|                                                    |              |
| Growth Rate Attributed to the Researcher           | 8%           |
| Growth Rate Attributed to Counterfactual ETG       | 3%           |
|                                                    |              |
| Start Year                                         | 34           |

**Lifetime Impact**

Filling in the above values in the [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=1112593483) estimates the
life time impact of the GiveWell Researcher path to vary between:

|                               | low  | best-guess | high |
|-------------------------------|------|------------|------|
| GW Researcher with shapely    | 564k | 739k       | 909k |
| GW Researcher without shapely | 840k | 1.4m       | 1.9k |

Even if I consider shapely values and have an addition multiplication
factor of 33% the values are comparable to DS-masters (`741k$`) and DS-L1 (`662k$`)

**Note**: Varying only the counterfactual contribution from 5-15%
captures the enitre variation from `840k$` to `1.9k$`. This goes on to
inform an audien that the GREATER you are than `GG` the GREATER the impact.


**P.S**

Funging, leveraging not considered.

## Scenario 4:

![CE](./images/career/CE.png)

The above decision tree shows the different parts expected on the
"Charity Entrepreneurship" route. I would start by applying to Charity
Entrepreneurship between age 30 and 34 while working on improving
myself during that time.

If I don't get into Charity Entrepreneurship in that time, then I
would try to get into research in GiveWell and if that doesn't work
out, the back options would be to go back to data science in
Netherlands or attempt the L1 option.

If I get into Charity Entrepreneurship, I startup own charity for
which on average it is expected to last 4 years (according to [Charity
Entrepreneurship cost-effectiveness analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-LdoC5XFYlObYXmIE_86kiVBZr4ixDgjnzAYxHI7ZSA/edit#gid=0&range=E51)) and then have to
move on to something else. Perhaps research/management in
GiveWell/GiveWell-like org!

<!-- According to [this cost-effectiveness analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T4-9YjHHvX2MNR6uzBPsZdcEtZWMF_F5utlw_rpda0s/edit#gid=0&range=E51), by Charity -->
<!-- Entrepreneurship, there is a 57% chance of the charity failing in 2 -->
<!-- years, 22% chance of failing in 5 years, 19% chance of failing in 10 -->
<!-- years and 1% chance of becoming a \>`10m$` charity. This comes to -->
<!-- about an average life time of 4.3 years. Also in the analysis thye -->
<!-- estimate lifetime impact based on these ~4 years. This is the 4 years -->
<!-- that is used in the decision tree, -->

### The Probabilities

The following table shows the different crossroads and probabilities
associated with them. And the last line repeats itself until I am 65
when I would need to retire.

| Year/age | Crossroad                                      | Success | Other |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| 30       | Rejected at CE                                 | 99%     | 1%    |
| 32       | Rejected at CE                                 | 85%     | 15%   |
| 34       | Accepted at CE                                 | 25%     | 75%   |
| 35       | Work on Charity without failing                | 96%     | 4%    |
| 36       | Work on Chartiy without failing                | 96%     | 4%    |
| 37       | Work on Charity without failing                | 96%     | 4%    |
| 37       | Rejected in GW or Gw type                      | 65%     | 35%   |
| 38       | Accepted at GW or GW type                      | 60%     | 40%   |
| 39       | Moving back due to recession or general firing | 96%     | 4%    |

Currently I think there is a very low chance of getting into Charity
Entrepreneurship and becoming an incubee. I didn't manage to make it
to their internship. Hence the `99% chance` of being rejected when I
apply now. Let's say over time I can develop skills and credentials
needed for it.

What I see in existing co-founders is that they have a "top notch"
education (like economics, philosophy master), already have experience
leading teams in social work and other, and/or have started local EA
chapters somewhere in the world. e.g., [Varsha who is running
Suvita](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varsha-venugopal/), [Michal who is running Policy Entrepreneurship
Network](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trzesimiech/?locale=en_US). Finding such experience seems to be hard. Getting
internships proves to be difficult already, let alone
program-manager-type positions.

Let's say I manage to support an existing EA group in Netherlands, and
work on finding volunteer positions at CEA to gain their confidence
for other roles, or even take up roles in EA research via unpaid
internships. Even then, with the massive pool of people (2000
applications of ~20 positions), it seems hard (1% acceptance rate) to
get into Charity Entrepreneurship. Hence the `15%` (1-`85%`) and `25%`
chances at age 32 and 34.

In case I do make it as an incubee, I would be starting up and working
on the charity for 4 years (which is the estimated time of an average
charity, Charity Entrepreneurship supports). After which I would need
to pick up something else. During the time of working on the startup
charity, I assume similar probabilities as done before, `96%` chance
of success.

After Charity Entrepreneurship charity, I could perhaps work in
research organizations like GiveWell. In Scenario 3 I assume a
probability of 20% and 60% to get into GiveWell in attempts 2
and 3. Here I assume similar probabilities for attempts at age 37 and
38 (35% and 60%). At age 37 I expect a higher chance of getting in
GiveWell having already started a charity and worked on it. Hopefully
it adds credentials.

### Effective value

To compute the effective value we need the following in addition to
the probabilities above.

1. Success of GiveWell 

2. Failure case when neither Charity Entrepreneurship or GiveWell
   works out.

3. Success of Charity Entrepreneurship


Success of GiveWell is already known from the previous
scenario. Failure would lead to either `DS in NL` or `DS L1` based on
the age. For the Success of a Charity Entrepreneurship charity
consider the following:

There is a cost-effectiveness analysis [from Charity Entrepreneurship
as to how much "counterfactual impact" a co-founder could
have](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T4-9YjHHvX2MNR6uzBPsZdcEtZWMF_F5utlw_rpda0s/edit#gid=0). They claim it is 100k `$` given to Malaria consortium or
1.5m `$` given to Give Directly per year. I am not convinced with this
and explain why below.

The cost-effectiveness analysis seems to have 4 components to it to
compute counterfactual impact of the Charity Entrepreneurship Charity:

- Estimated impact due to Charity Entrepreneurship Charity (add)

	- Estimated size of Charity Entrepreneurship charity or revenue to
	an "average" charity is `1.46m$`.
	
	- Estimated average cost-effectiveness of their charities is 7.
	
	- Estimated impact due to Charity Entrepreneurship Charity is
	`1.4mx7 = 10m$` per year per charity donated to Give Directly.
	
- Estimated loss in impact due to taking away funding from other charities
  (subtract)

	- On average their charities redirect 26% from GiveWell top
	charities, 8% from Give Directly, 36% from non-GiveWell etc.
	
	- Cost-effectiveness of GiveWell top charities (~~15.2~~ 18), Give
      Directly (1), and non-GiveWell orgs (0.38) is known.
	  
	- Average cost-effectiveness is `26% x 18 + 8% x 1 + 36% x 0.38
      ...` = `5.3`.
	  
	- Estimated loss in impact = `1.46m$ x 5.3` = `7m$` per year per
      charity donated to Give Directly. 

- Estimated loss due to one-time costs of Charity

	- This is assumed to be 100k for a 2 person charity started in the
	UK. 
	
	- Unfortunately the cost-effectiveness analysis seems to suggest
	that [this 100k would be given to Give Directly](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T4-9YjHHvX2MNR6uzBPsZdcEtZWMF_F5utlw_rpda0s/edit#gid=0&range=E55) if there was
	no Charity Entrepreneurship Charity. I disagree.
	
	- I think the cost-effectiveness of this 100k would also be 5.3
      (just like the previous case).
	  
	- We get `100k/4.31 x 5.3` = `123k$` per year per charity, donated
	to Give Directly. (A Charity Entrepreneurship charity is expected
	to exist for 4.31 years on average according to Charity
	Entrepreneurship.)
	
- Estimated loss in impact due to co-founder Earning-To-Give
  (counterfactual) (-ve)
  
  - If the co-founders decide not to go through with the org then they
	ought to be doing something else. Here it is assumed they could be
	Earning-To-Give. Considering that they are already co-founder
	material, Charity Entrepreneurship assumes a salary of 100k and a
	donation of 50%. There is 100k per year available to be donated
	anywhere assuming 2 co-founders.

  - Unfortunately they seem to be thinking that [this 100k would also
	be given to Give Directly](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T4-9YjHHvX2MNR6uzBPsZdcEtZWMF_F5utlw_rpda0s/edit#gid=0&range=E55) instead of the other more
	cost-effective ones available with GiveWell. *I disagree* with
	them.

  - I think the cost-effectiveness of donations can be as high as 18
   assuming the co-founders just hand over the money to GiveWell to do
   what it sees fit. In 2018 GiveWell has an [average
   cost-effectiveness of 18](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=1202275292&range=A1) with the way it distributes the
   funds. This being the case means that the estimated impact of both
   co-founders doing Earning-To-Give is `100k x 18`= `1.8m$` per year
   per charity donated to Give Directly.

This is summed up in the following table:

| add/sub | Estimated impact/loss       | cost-eff. | `$`   | `$` per year   |
|         | due to                      |           |       | per charity to |
|         |                             |           |       | Give Directly  |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Add     | Charity                     | 7         | 1.46m | 10m            |
| Sub     | Taking away funding         | 5.3       | 1.46m | 7.7m           |
| Sub     | One time costs              | 5.3       | 23k   | 123k           |
| Sub     | Co-founders Earning-To-Give | 18        | 100k  | 1.8m           |

Average impact of a charity per year in dollars donated to Give
Directly is `527k$`. If we want to compare it to regular donations
then, we should compare it say dollars donated to GiveWell. Looking at
this `527k$` in terms of dollars donated to GIVEWELL--i.e., divide by
cost-effectiveness of 18--we get `29.3k$ ` per year per charity donated to
GiveWell. This is for 2 co-founders. For one co-founder this is
`14.6k$` per year per charity.


**Lifetime Impact**

Filling in the above values in the [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wfa8XFt98gqVNdfLaV8umMqASfVNx7QtYwwPjWe6Sew/edit#gid=1618791818) estimates the
life time impact of the Charity Entrepreneurship path to vary between
`914k$` and `1.97m$`, with the best-guess estimate at `1.45m$`. The
main reason this is so high is because of GiveWell researcher being
followed up with.

## Conclusion

The lifetime calculations are shown below:

| Effective value                | low      | BGE      | high     |
|--------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| DS Masters                     | 713k     | 741k     | 865k     |
| DS L1                          | 642k     | 662k     | 875k     |
| ~~GW Researcher with shapely~~ | ~~564k~~ | ~~739k~~ | ~~909k~~ |
| GW Researcher                  | 914k     | 1.43m    | 1.95k    |
| CE                             | 914k     | 1.42m    | 1.97m    |
| DS NL                          | -        | 569k     | 698k     |

It seems quite clear that pursuing the GiveWell route has very high
potential even if we look at the lower bound of the estimate, which
assumes I am only 5% "better" than the person being displaced at the
end of the chain (`GG`) into Earning-To-Give.

Charity Entrepreneurship route and GiveWell route seem to have similar
impact. This is not too surprising as for most part the Charity
Entrepreneurship decision tree has GiveWell researcher decision tree
in it. We assume that Charity Entrepreneurship's charity only works
for 4 years (as has been estimated by Charity Entrepreneurship as
average). After modifying Charity Entrepreneurship's
cost-effectiveness analysis we come to the conclusion that lifetime
counterfactual impact of running a charity on average is only
`60k$`(`15k$x4`) for those 4 years. This seems low considering that
first year in GiveWell produces `70k$`. I don't know what sort of
value this adds to the jobs I would search for later. I feel more
comfortable going into the GiveWell route where in theory I can wfh
and improve my skills. Maybe later in life once I have some experience
in research I can still consider founding etc.

But so far as the estimated lifetime impact, the GiveWell route seems
to be the clear winner.

## Opportunity costs

After trying for 4 years, if I don't get into GiveWell, then I plan to
pursue DS with L1. Based on this is what the effective value of the
decision tree is calculated.

Currently, I am working in a mechanical engineering company. I know DS
and DS in US is a cashcow and that is what I am chasing as a backup
incase for any reason it is not possible to get into GiveWell or
GiveWell-type orgs (Open Phil for e.g.,). While trying to get into
GiveWell I think I will need a day job in the Netherlands and easiest
is to continue with what I am doing. However I propose to already
change to DS in the next six months and keep clocking hours in the
back "gaining experience" while I pursue becoming a GiveWell
researcher. Worst case at 35 I continue DS with L1 attempts. Such a
decision has consequences.

Case 1: Start the GiveWell route 1 year later, transition to DS in the
mean time.

Case 2: Start GiveWell route now and at 35 start DS for the first time
in case GiveWell career fails.

Lifetime impact estimates of both are useful in determining which side
I would be better.

Life time impact of case 1 seems to be: `1.363m$`. While life time
impact of Case 2 seems to be: `1.359m$`. This is a very small number
to take difference to take seriously. For example, I have not included
the effect of have 3-5 years experience in DS when I have to pursue DS
in L1. The starting salary could be higher in US. So Case 1 seems to
trump Case 2 nevertheless.


If the difference were in the order of `50k$`, then I would seriously
try to go behind a particular case. Now it just seems that both cases
would end up with similar results and I have a strong preference for
Case 1.

[^2]: **Chance of getting an H1B with Master's or L1**

The number of times a person can apply for H1B on a Master's is around
[3 times on a STEM OPT](https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-can-I-apply-for-a-H1B-visa-after-getting-STEM-Masters) (answer by Carlos Cueva). With an L1, we
assume we are ready from the 3rd year on to apply for an H1B (having
secured another job by then). So we will have the same 3 chances to
apply for H1B or maybe more depending on when I start finding jobs. We
stick to 3 for now.

Based on a 50% split between the general pool and the advanced pool
([which is what the DHS have assumed](https://www.happyschools.com/h1b-visa-2020-probability-lottery/)), we see that 1 H1B attempt
has a [41.9% chance of success](https://bintlr.work/h1bProbabilityEstimate.html) for students with Master's.

Getting selected in the lottery alone is not enough. After you are
selected in the lottery, you are either approved or rejected or sent
an [RFE](https://goh1b.com/en/blog/2019/07/02/what-does-h1b-rfe-mean-most-common-reasons/) (request for evidence) by the USCIS. The overall cases of
rejection after getting the lottery have become much higher [(33% in
2019 from 10% in 2016)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2019/08/08/latest-uscis-data-show-increase-in-denials-for-new-h-1b-visas/#5443e3417cc4) over the trump era.

It doesn't appear that people are rejected straightaway without being
asked for RFE. None of my friends have had a direct rejection and I
have not come across cases with direct rejection on blind either.

**What is the chance of getting an RFE?**

One of the things the USCIS seem to be scrutinizing the people for is,
not having the **"right" background/experience for the work**. This
comes under "Beneficiary qualifications". Naturally, this scares me as
I have a mechanical Master's and Bachelor's while I am looking to move
into DS. Another common reason issued by the USCIS is called
"Speciality Occupation". The **position needs to qualify as a
speciality occupation**. Apparently [USCIS does not usually think a
job is "special enough", if they don't have the need for a "relevant"
bachelor's](https://ogletree.com/insights/uscis-issues-top-10-reasons-for-h-1b-requests-for-evidence/) (a CS bachelor's for a software job). If you look on
[trackitt](https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/h1b), you do see that "most" of the RFEs are cited based on
this "Specialty Occupation" or "lack of relevant degree" (Beneficiary
qualifications I presume). Thus, I seem like a prime suspect for
atleast lack of "beneficiary qualifications". Thus, I guess that I
have a `100%` chance of getting an RFE.

Whether the RFE gets approved or not however seems to be random. There
are cases of people with Bachelor's and Master's in Mechanical who
have made it to software job after their RFEs ([ronaldo7!](https://www.teamblind.com/post/6mTKzvNm),
[tiger12](https://www.teamblind.com/post/H1B-RFE-Data-Scientist-III-PqF7wkMk)) post 2018. And then there are people with Master's in
Financial Mathematics who are Rejected after their RFE for a CS/DS job
([9mineHwang](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Im-a-data-scientist-and-I-got-a-H1B-RFE-again-UvhDqaXm)). A Hiring manager at Amazon sums up what a giant
cluster fuck of a mess it is: "One of my report’s visa was rejected
saying the job is not a specialty occupation and doesn’t need
Bachelor's degree which is ridiculous as why would Amazon pay that
person 300K`$` per year for a non-specialty job.  The decision on visa
application has become so arbitrary that the outcome is not known.
One employee has one application rejected and the same application was
approved the second time."---[hiring manager Amazon](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Immigration-Mess-sAYGCXgg).

Having received the RFE, [according to Fragoman](https://www.fragomen.com/insights/alerts/latest-uscis-data-confirm-continued-high-rates-nonimmigrant-rfes-and-denials-fy-2019) the success of RFE
approval amounts to 60.4%. So the chance of winning the lottery and
getting RFE accepted is, `41.9% x 100% x 60.4%=25.3%` for 1
attempt of H1B. Over three attempts the chance becomes
`1-(1-25.3%)^3`=58%. More attempts implies better chances to stay in
the US.

**Note:** Some companies do not hire you in your OPT if you don't have
[atleast 2 attempts](https://www.teamblind.com/post/FAANG-that-accepts-candidate-with-less-than-24-month-OPT-46DqLqvB) left. Also there is a possibility of applying
with many H1B sponsors for the same year with different employers. So
the number of tries can theoretically be greater than 3.
