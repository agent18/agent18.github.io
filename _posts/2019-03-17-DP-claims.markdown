- Identify what the text is not saying! the text for an example to
  pass a claim is that it should have atleast one example!

	The goal seems to be not to understand principle of virtual works,
	but to understand what I don't understand and where and why?

## Mission #7 

Mission #7: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
identify claims and get concrete examples to test them.

Primary target: The same work-related document as last time that you
need to understand thoroughly but currently don't. For each sentence,
identify the claim, break up any "or" and "and" into separate phrases,
get a concrete example for each, and test whether the claim is true
for that concrete example.

If the author provides a running example, hold on to it for dear life
and use it throughout that section or chapter. (When I said "running
example", did you think of Stripe and "schlep blindness" and did you
imagine going through PG's essay with that in mind? SS should have
T-ed.)

If you don't "understand" something, specify exactly on which part you
failed.

**P & E:**

> (concepts of energy)[3] and (work)[4] and therefore (provides a better
> understanding)[5] of (mechanical phenomena)[6].

For [1], we can think of the equation of the POVW used to identify the
relationship between force (F) and stiffness (k) for the truss problem
below.

$$\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2 = F\times\delta y $$

![truss example](./images/images-DP-3/truss.jpg) 


For [2]: determining the force F at equilibrium for a given stiffness

For [3]: Energy of a spring, `$\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2$`

For [4]: Work done by the Force F, `$F\times\delta y$`

For [5]: It's easy to see that F increases then k increases in the
above equation.

Contrast this to vector mechanics, where we have to write atleast 6
equations (`$\Sigma Fx=0$, $\Sigma Fy=0$ & $\Sigma M=0$` (2x)). In
these equations we also have the reaction forces at A and C involved,
and the internal forces in the truss members. We can solve all this
and get a function `f(geometry, reaction force, internal force,
stiffness)=0` from which it will not be as handy to see the effect of
stiffness on the force F; as compared to `f(geometry, Force, Stiffness)=0`

For [6]: relation between `F & k`. F is directly proportional to k.

**Claims**

>{(The analytical approach)[1] to (mechanics)[2] is based on the
> (concepts of energy)[3] and (work)[4]}(A)

In the example approach below[1] we see the usage of energy[3] and work[4] to
identify the relationship between F and k[2].  

$$\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2 = F\times dy$$

> The analytical approach based on the concepts of energy and work
> (provides a better understanding)[5] of (mechanical
> phenomena)[6]}(B)

F increases, then k increases based on the analytical approach. When
you contrast this to vector mechanics, you see that it is hard to see
the relationship between F & k, due to the presence of reaction and
internal forces.

$$\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2 = F\times dy$$

For [7]: the POVW equation seen above for the truss

For [8]: We look at only the **input** F and the **output** travel of
spring to reach the balance the forces. 

For [9]: We skip the internal forces, reaction forces at A and C for
example.

For [10]: Internal forces in the truss member and the reaction forces
at A & C.

For [11]: We think of the yellow plane in the above figure does not
allow Point C to move in the horizontal direction

For [12]: We think of the truss members and the spring

**Claims**

The analytical approach allows for the following equation:

$$\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2 = F\times\delta y $$

which considers the system based on input work and output displacement
of spring[8], not bothering about the reaction forces that are
generated at C and A[9] imposed by the yellow plane[11] on the truss members[12].

### DP part 2 (13)

**P & E**

> - (It)[1] (considerably simplifies)[2] the (analytical formulation)[3] of
> the (motion equations)[4] for a (complex)[5a] (mechanical system)[5].

For 4, think of the motion equation of a single pendulum

`$ml^2 \ddot{\theta} +mgl \sin{\theta}=0$` 

For 1 and 3, think of the derivation of the motion equations for a
simple pendulum using the POVW approach. - pg 22 Mechanical Vibrations
by Daniel Rixen

For 5, imagine a double pendulum.

For 5a: With a simple pendulum we deal with a 1x1 matrix (basically
not a matrix) in the derivation, which is very easy to work out by
hand. But with a double pendulum, we deal with 2x2 matrices which are
hard to keep track of, in the derivation of motion equations.

![double pendulum](./images/images-DP-3/dp.png)

For 2: When we use the POVW to derive the motion equations of a double
pendulum we have 2 equations in the end which need to be solved. When
we use the newton-euler equations we quickly see that we need to
construct 6 equations and need to solve them simultaneously. 

**Claims**

>Analytical approach **simplifies** the analytical formulation of
>motion equations for complex systems

When we use the POVW to derive the motion equations of a double
pendulum we have 2 equations in the end which need to be solved. When
we use the newton-euler equations we quickly see that we need to
construct 6 equations and need to solve them simultaneously.

For 6a, we think of the derivation of motion equations for a double
pendulum using the POVW.

for 6, we imagine giving the output of the analytical approach (the
differential equations) to MATLAB to solve (because it takes too much
effort to solve by hand)

For 7a,

"Numerical solution:

let's guess 𝑥=1: 𝑓(1)=1−5=−4. A negative number. Let's guess 𝑥=6: 𝑓(6)=6−5=1. A positive number.

The answer must be between them. Let's try 𝑥=6+12: 𝑓(72)<0
So it must be between 72 and 6...etc.

This is called bisection method." - [Stack](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/935458/332456)'

*Here I should actually try to show solving the equation of motion
using exact and numerical methods and show what is meant by
approximation, but I need a few hours to recollect how to use
them, so I have not done them*

For 7, [Runge Kutta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)

For 8: Solution for `$ml^2 \ddot{\theta} + mgl \sin{\theta}=0$` will look
something like `$\theta(t)=\theta_0 \cos{(\omega t + \phi)}$`, where
$\omega$ and $\phi$ need to be determined.

For 9, we think of a double pendulum

For 10, we think of a beam with a time-varying force `$F=F_0
\sin{\omega t}$`

For 11, it is not clear what the intention of the author is, so we
skip it

*I don't know what example to give for "gives rise to"! Does it need
an example? I am here thinking what does "giving rise to look like"*


**Claim A**

> - (It)[6a] **(gives rise to)[6**] (approximate)[7a] (numerical
> methods)[7] for the (solution)[8] of both (discrete)[9] and
> (continuous systems)[10] in the (most natural manner)[11], as will
> be later explained in Chapters 5 and 6.

**Claim AA:** Analytical approach gives rise to approximate numerical
methods for the solution of discrete systems.

**Claim AB:** Analytical approach gives rise to approximate numerical methods for the solution
of continuous systems.

If you take a double pendulum[9], and produce the motion equations with
POVW[6a], you get 

![double pendulum](./images/images-DP-3/dp.png)

When you give this to a MATLAB[6] it will use Runge-Kutta  (or similar
techniques)[7,7a] to find the $\theta\_1$ & $\theta\_2$ at say t=1s [8].

A continuous system like a beam with a varying load is split into
finite discrete elements (100 bar elements), following which it is treated
like a discrete system which gives rise to "approximate NM" as above.

**P&E**

> (equilibrium)[4] of the (particle)[1] can be expressed in

For 1, we imagine a simple pendulum

For 2, we imagine the pendulum being subjected to gravity alone, i.e.,
a force $mg$ in the downward direction

For 3, the force field can be denoted as [0,mg]

For 4a, when the pendulum is being pulled to a height h and let go, it
keeps moving

For 4, we imagine the pendulum being pulled to a height h and let go
of. There is a force `$mg \sin{\theta}$` on the ball countered by an equal
opposite force. Hence equilibrium.

For 5, the dynamic equilibrium in the Y is written as `$T
\cos{\theta} - mg - m\ddot{u_1} = 0$` and in the X direction written
mas `$ T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2} = 0 $`

For 6, we imagine the pendulum moving from the mean position to a
position $\theta=90^\circ$. The displacement, $u_i=L$ as it is
measured from the mean position

**The claim**: dynamic equilibrium of a particle can be expressed in
d'Alembert's form

**The example proving the claim**: A pendulum subjected to gravity
being written in the d'Alhembert's form.

the dynamic equilibrium in the Y is written as `$T
\cos{\theta} - mg - m\ddot{u_1} = 0$` and in the X direction written
as `$ T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2} = 0 $`

![vd](./images/images-DP-3/VD.png)

For 1 & 5: we imagine a simple pendulum

For 2, We imagine the pendulum like below making an S shape between
two points A and B on the spherical surface

![sph-pendulum](./images/images-DP-3/sph-pendulum.png)

For 3, we imagine the same pendulum making a C shape between the same
A and B

For 4a, we think of the 2 distinct trajectories [2] and [3].

For 4: I hear people say it is an "infinitesimal" displacement. I see
it as something that houses the direction information (tangents) as shown
above. And then I go to the equations straight.

The VD can also be split into X and Y components, displacement
in the X direction is given by $u_2=L \sin{\theta}$, the virtual
displacement is given by differentiating as $\delta u_2=L
\cos{\theta}$.

*This is just an equation, I don't have an example for what it is
supposed to look like, when I think of a pendulum, I don't understand
what it means to subtract two paths and say that this is the virtual
displacement*

For 6, I don't know how to get $\delta u_2=L \cos{\theta}$, from [2]
and [3] as shown in figure 1.1 above. How when you subtract 2
trajectories you get the virtual displacement.

So, there seem to be **2 claims**:

> [2] and[3] allows to define the (virtual displacement)[4] 

I don't know how [2] and [3] allow for the definition of [4]. How
subtracting any 2 random trajectories is supposed to give the virtual
displacement.

> [4] can be obtained from [6] 

I have not one example for this. It is the same as previous claim.  

*I spent >2 hrs on this particular part and was not able to produce
 examples for [6] and [4a]. It was weird that the youtube and
 stackexhange I referred, were wanting to talk only in pure abstract
 terms without providing one single running example*

For 7, No idea

For 7a, we imagine the same virtual displacement as before for a
simple pendulum.

For 8, I can't think of what it means in the context of a simple
pendulum, as there are only 2 paths as explained in 9.

For 9, we imagine the pendulum going counterclockwise from the
mean position to $\theta=90^\circ$

For 10, we imagine the pendulum going from mean position to say
$\theta=90^\circ$ but in the clockwise direction.

For 11, the difference in trajectories at $\theta=0^\circ$ &
$\theta=30^\circ$ are equal to 0.

For 12, we already have "`$\delta u_i(t_1)=\delta u_i(t_2)=0$`"

**Claims**

No examples!

When paths [9] and [10] are subtracted only at the ends, they will give
[12] for the case of pendulum.

For 1, we imagine the pendulum and the dynamic equilibrium equations
written in Y : `$T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1} = 0$` and in the
X direction written as `$ T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2} = 0$`

For 2 & 8, we imagine the following virtual displacements for a simple pendulum.

 ![pendulum VD](./images/images-DP-3/pendulum-vd.png)

For 1a, 3 and 4: `$(T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1}) \times (-l
\sin{\theta}) + (T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2}) (l \cos{\theta}) $`

For 4b,5: We imagine multiplying the forces in Y (equilibrium
equation) with virtual displacements,

`$(T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1}) (-l \sin{\theta})$`

In X,

`$(T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2}) (l \cos{\theta})$`

For 6, 

For 7, we think of the simple pendulum.

For 9: As [1] is equal to 0, multiplying by [1] and summing continues to give 0.

**The claim**

The claim is that if we multiply [1] by [2] and sum them for each
component, we should get an expression resulting in 0 [4], which we do,
as [1] is equal to 0, multiplying and summing still continues to give
0.

> (The virtual work above)[1] represents the (scalar product)[2]

For 1, we imagine this:

`$(T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1}) \times (-l \sin{\theta}) + (T
\sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2}) (l \cos{\theta}) $`

For 2: we imagine the multiplication and subsequent addition of two
vectors in the following way. This is what is done above as well with
the Forces in X and Y and the Virtual Displacements in X and Y.

![scalar](./images/images-DP-3/scalar.png)

For 3, we think of the gravitational force (mg), the inertial force
($m \ddot{u}$ and the Tension for T.

For 4, we think of the same VD's for the pendulum given by

![pendulum VD](./images/images-DP-3/pendulum-vd.png)

**Claims**

> (The virtual work above)[1] represents the (scalar product)[2]
> between the (forces acting on the particle)[3] and the (virtual
> displacement δu)[4]

The following is an example of the above claim where the Forces in X
and Y are multiplied with their virtual displacements and then added.

`$(T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1}) \times (-l \sin{\theta}) +   (T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2})  (l \cos{\theta})  $`

---
<br>

**P&E**

> (It)[5a] thus represents the (projection)[5] of the (equilibrium)[6]
> (along the direction δu)[7].

For 5a, we imagine the final virtual works equation, 

`$(m \ddot{u_1}-mg) (-l \sin{\theta}) + (m \ddot{u_2}) (l
\cos{\theta})=0$`

For 6, we imagine the dynamic equilibrium in X and Y

Y : `$T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1} = 0$`   
X : `$ T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2} = 0$`

For 7: 

The virtual displacement is nothing but the instantaneous direction of
the pendulum at any given time. This is nothing but the direction
which is perpendicular to the string.

![pendulum VD](./images/images-DP-3/pendulum-vd.png)


For 5, When you "project" a vertical line on to a horizontal plane you
get 0

![projection](./images/images-DP-3/projection.png)

Similarly when you project the Tension onto the virtual displacement
(which is $\perp$'r to the Tension, then you get 0 as seen in the
following:

Equation M: `$(T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1}) \times (-l \sin{\theta}) + (T
\sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2}) (l \cos{\theta}) $`

The tension terms cancel out and it becomes: `$(m \ddot{u_1}-mg) (-l
\sin{\theta}) + (m \ddot{u_2}) (l \cos{\theta})=0$`

**Claim**

> (It)[5a] thus represents the (projection)[5] of the (equilibrium)[6]
> (along the direction δu)[7].

As seen with the above equations, the projection of equilibrium along the virtual
displacement kills Tension as it is perpendicular to the virtual
displacement at all angles. Hence 5a, represents a PROJECTION.

For 8 we think of,

For 9, I don't know what it means in the case of a simple pendulum

For 10, we think of moving from $\theta=0^\circ$ to $\theta=30^\circ$

For 11, we imagine the dynamic equilibrium in X and Y

Y : `$T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1} = 0$`   
X : `$ T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2} = 0$`

For 12, we think of the X and Y directions.

For 1: Imagine a ball rolling on plane, it can move beyond 100km
in any directions along the plane. It has no constraints along the plane.

For 3, imagine a tennis ball.

For 4: There is no wall, or person to stop the ball

For 5, imagine the ball being hit by a bat from position 300m to
1km in the X direction. The displacement is 0.7km.

For 6, we think of the straight line the ball would move in.

For 8, If the ball is hit by a bat in the North direction (Y) and the
east (X) direction with a force of 10N, the equilibrium equations are 

`X: $10\times\cos{45} - m_{ball}\times a_x}$`  
`Y: $10\times\sin{45} - m_{ball}\times a_y}$`

For 7, the `$a_x=7m/s^2$` and `$a_y=7m/s^2$` for a mass of
1kg if found from the above equations. This allows us to calculate the distance
traveled by the ball in north-east direction for, 5s as 35m [5].

**Claims**

As shown above, we are able to calculate that the ball will move 35m
as a result of the equilibrium equations shown in [8].

For 9a, we imagine a string (of length L) on a ball[9c]. The ball cannot
move $>L$ as a result of the string.

For 9b, we imagine tying the ball to the string and fixating one end
of the string.

For 9, we imagine the tension force in the string 

For 10, we have both Tension as well as gravity force acting on the
ball

For 11, we imagine the gravitational force mg


**Claims**

>When we have [9a], there is [9], and [11]

We look at the example of the pendulum and it checks out that it has
the tension force and the gravity force. The tension force comes about
due to the kinematic constraint provided by the string!

For 12, we imagine the tension force. 

For 13, we see that as soon as there is a string and the ball hanging, then there is a
reaction force. 

For 14, we imagine a string allowing the ball to move only along a
circumference of circle of radius L.

For 15, The tension force is responsible for holding the ball at L by
providing an equal and opposite force to gravity (in the mean position)

For 16, we write out the kinematic constraint as $r=L$

For 17, we imagine the $r=L$ and not $r<L$ and not $r>L$, i.e., the
string is in tension


**Claims**

> When there is [14] there is [12]

When there is a string and the ball is hanging, there are immediately
Tension forces (reaction forces) in the string.

> [12] ensures that [16] is satisfied.

The tension force[12] is responsible for holding the ball at L by
providing an equal and opposite force to gravity (in the mean
position), there by holding the realation $r=L$ (satisfied).

@ $r=L$, $T=mg$ for the case of the pendulum

@ $r<L$, $T=0N$ for the case of the pendulum


**P&E**

> Those (reaction forces)[18] are (not known in advance)[19] since
> they (depend)[20a] on the (motion)[20] itself.


For 18, we imagine the tension in the string

For 19, the reaction forces in the below equation are unknown. They
need to be computed solving for the following dynamic equilibrium
equations given $\theta$ and accelerations.

Y : `$T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1} = 0$`   
X : `$ T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2} = 0$`

So there is a different tension force depending on whether the
pendulum is rising against gravity from the mean position or falling
from a height towards the mean position.

When the pendulum is just dropped from 45 degrees, the acceleration is
0 at that point, and the tension = 7 N

When the pendulum is at the mean position without any acceleration
i.e, $\theta = 0^\circ$ then T=10N

For 20, \theta and \ddot{u} inform us about the motion; if theta is 0
and the acceleration is >0 then it means that the pendulum is going to
move against gravity.

For 20a, $T = f(\theta $ and $ \ddot{u})$ (as in the dynamic
equilibrium equations)

**Claim**

> [18] are not known because of [20]

Y : `$T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1} = 0$`   
X : `$ T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2} = 0$`

In the above equation we see that $T = f(\theta$ and $ \ddot{u})$,
i.e., the variables related to motion.

For 4, we imagine the gutter trajectory that goes from the main area

For 5, as in figure

For 6, we think of a ball

For 7, we think of the string forcing the ball to be at a radius of L
at all times.

For 8a, we think of L, the distance between one end of the string to
the pendulum side.

For 8, we think of the opposite end of the pendulum that is fixed.

For 9, we imagine the Tension force in a pendulum.

For 9a, we imagine pulling on the pendulum so that there is no slack
in the string, which is when the Tension in the string appears.

For 10a, for a pendulum in the mean position, we can imagine that the
pendulum will not go down even if 100kN of force is applied. It will
stay at L (assuming the string can handle the stress and does not
deform beyond L). This downward direction is the direction of the
constraint. However, if you pull in the horizontal plane, it will
move, i.e., the resistance to motion is along the string.

For 10, we think about the direction of Tension force (vertical) being
the same as the direction of constraint (vertical)

For 10b, *I don't know what example to give! Need help! Do I need to
give an example?*

For 10c, *I don't know what example to give! Need help!*

For 11, we think of the same dynamic equilibrium equations for the
pendulum

Y : `$T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1} = 0$`   
X : `$ T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2} = 0$`

For 12, due to the reaction forces, we now have an additional term to
compute at every $\theta$

> since those (unknown forces)[12a] must be (determined)[13] along the

For 12a, we think about the Tension T,

For 13, we deal with this in the claim.

For 14, lets say you pull the pendulum to an $\theta = 30^\circ$ and
let it go, it will make a to and fro trajectory

For 15, we think of the string that adds a constraint $r=L$ to the
system.

For 16, explained in the claim.

**Claims**

The presence of Tension forces[9] in the direction of the string[10a]
adds the "T" term to the equation below. This T needs to be computed
for every angle [14], making it more time consuming (more complex)
than when there is no tension force.

Y : `$T \cos{\theta} - mg - m \ddot{u_1} = 0$`   
X : `$ T \sin{\theta} - m \ddot{u_2} = 0$`

> [12a] must be determined, such that [15] is satisfied.

 @ $\theta=30^\circ$ if we want to find the Tension force, we need the
acceleration. The acceleration is in the tangential direction to the
string is `$a_t = g \sin{30} = 5m/s^2$` for all angles when
$r=L$[15]. From this we calculate `$\ddot{u_1} = a_t \sin{\theta} =
2.5m/s^2 $`, which allows the Tension to equal to 14N.

For 9, Anders has been publishing papers from 1990 until now (2019) on
the topic related to "expertise in skills" (40 years).

For 11, Jerry Rice is one of the "greatest receivers" in NFL
history. He has played 22 seasons and every game in every season
except in 1997. No one has done this ever at the "receiver position".

For 12, "His off season training's were done 6 days a week. His
workouts were known as the most demanding in the league, which other
players would get sick before the end of the day. His trainer wouldn't
reveal the workouts because the trainer was afraid that people could
injure themselves trying to duplicate it." Source: TIO.

For 10, In the 1985 draft, fifteen teams passed him over before the
San Francisco 49ers finally signed him, indicating that he was never
going to be a legend. But he did become a legend, seemingly because of
[12]

**Claims**

> Never found a convincing case for [11] without [12]

In the 1985 draft, fifteen teams passed him over before the
San Francisco 49ers finally signed him, indicating that he was never
going to be a legend. But he did become a legend[11], seemingly because of
[12].

For 1, we come back to the example of Shizuka Arakawa

For 2, we think of Olympic gold medal

For 3, we think of when she won her Olympic gold medal at 24

For 4, we think of her starting at the age of 5.

For 6: Leopold Mozart wrote a book on violin instruction which
remained "influential" for "decades".

For 7: !!!

*In this case do I need to give an example of Mozart "getting trained
intensely"? It's hard to find them* 

For 8: Age 5 is when Mozart started learning music.

**Claims**

> People like [1] succeeded young because they started young.

Shizuka Arakawa, got her gold Olympic medal at 24 while she started
training at 5. 

Marie Curie won the Nobel prize at 36, and she seemed to have started
university when she was 24.

*How will you test the claim with an example that someone succeeded
young **because** they started young? I try to give 2 examples one of
a person who started young, and the other of a person who started
later and got her success later.*

> Mozart's Father trained Mozart "intensely"[7] as a toddler.

*I don't have an example*

**P&E**

> (All this)[1a] (may sound like a bit of a downer)[2]: being (successful)[3] (takes
> time)[4]. But consider the (flip side)[5]: you can (improve)[6].

For 1a, we think of Shizuka Arakawa's long journey of 20 years before
winning the gold medal

For 2, I imagine the feeling that even after 50 hrs of training over
15 weeks, I missed 10 continuous shots in the game. I was like 'what is
the point of training and spending so much time per week!'.

For 3, Getting an Olympic Gold medal

For 4: takes 20 years

For 5, 

*Does it need an example, if so what is it? how do you give an example
here?*

For 6, [Guy improving from 36% to 42% in 4 weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8RXei5Jn3Q) courtesy of
shooting 100 shots a day.

*I am finding it hard to find one running example and split it among 1
to 6, am I expected to do that? Is it a requirement? In the claims I
understand that it would all need to be from the same example.*

**Claims**

> Being successful takes time

Shizuka Arakawa won gold medal after 20 years of training

> You can improve

**P&E**

> Lots of people come to us saying “I’m not sure I have any (useful
> skills)[1] to (contribute)[2]”. And that’s (often)[2a] true. If you’ve
> (just graduated)[3], you’ve probably spent the last four years
> (studying)[4] (Moby Dick, quantum mechanics, and Descartes)[5], and
> your (future job)[6] is (unlikely to involve)[7] any of (those

For 2, I think of work at GiveWell

For 1, I think of programming, statistics, critical thinking

*All skills that a typical ignorant Dutch person cannot understand;
pure labels? Can you please give an example?*

*Cant believe I am spending more than 15-20 mins trying to come up
with an example for skills* or *an equally unacceptable answer like below*

"Interpreting and critiquing statistical analysis : A basic
understanding of causal inference is helpful (for example,
understanding the typical limitations of experimental,
quasi-experimental, and observational methods; being able to quickly
read and understand a regression table)."

For 2a, I think of myself as not fit for GiveWell level of statistics
yet (I don't know what regression table is).

For 3, I imagine what happened after I graduated from the mechanical
engineering master

For 5, I think of  subjects like non-linear dynamics, compliant
mechanisms that I completed.

For 4, I think of getting 80% in the subject exams

For 6, I work in Machine Design, building modules that clamp wafers

For 7 & 8, I don't use any of the things I learnt in my entire masters
except for 1 book and only 4/10 chapters of it; let alone these being
useful for EA work.

**Claims**

> [6] is probably not going to need [5]

Dynamics, compliant mechanisms are not going to be useful for work at GiveWell.

*I am not sure if I need to give examples for "likely", "probably".*

**P&E**

> However, (Ericsson’s research)[9] suggests that (anyone)[10] (can
> improve)[11] at many (skills)[12] with (focused practice)[13]. 

For 9, we think of the study with the violinists[TOI chapter 4].

For 10, I think of [this guy and look at how much he sucked in the beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMcdhCR9Ubw)

For 11, I think of [Guy improving from 36% to 42% in 4 weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8RXei5Jn3Q)

For 12, I think playing the guitar, chess, basketball, programming,
and "critical thinking" as evident from TIO

*I have an SST that my examples for skills are crap, can you weigh
in?*

For 13, I think of Jerry Rice, who did workouts for his conditioning 6
times a week which no one else could finish even once. 

*Not an example? Should be more like made 400 shots a day?*

**Claims**

> Anyone can improve skills [13]

[This guy totally sucks when he started and after 7k hours he's
phenomenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMcdhCR9Ubw).

For 14, we think of bodybuilding where not everybody has the **genes** to look
like Arnold or Dwayne *the rock* Johnson.

For 15, Without the right genes there is no point getting into
bodybuilding and aiming to look like Arnold.

For 16, In the place where I live people who want to even play in
the basketball team have to be 6 foot of higher

For 17, joining the NBA

For 18, Spud Webb was 5ft 7 inches, the shortest player to participate
and win the NBA Slam Dunk Contest.

For 19: [Guy improving from 36% to 42% in 4 weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8RXei5Jn3Q)

**Claims**

> [14] is important

"Good genes" like that of Arnold or Dwayne would help in winning
Mr. Olympia competition.

> If you're 7 foot tall, it's going to be [16] to [17]

In the place where I live people who want to even play in the
basketball team have to be 6 foot of higher.

> short people can improve their game

Spud Webb was 5ft 7 inches, the shortest player to participate and win
the NBA Slam Dunk Contest.

For 20, we think of not being able to play Joe Satriani's song "tears
in the rain"

For 21, We think of [this guitarist how he went from nothing to
strictly phenomenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMcdhCR9Ubw) in 7000 hrs [22]

For 23 & 24,

"Jamie Dimon was an amazingly accomplished financial services
executive at age twenty-nine, but he was much better at fifty, as CEO
of JPMorgan Chase[21,22]"- (TIO pg179)

*What is this "much better" you ask? I couldn't think of other
examples, than from the TIO*

**Claims**

> You can [21] in the future

We think of [this guitarist how he went from nothing to strictly
phenomenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMcdhCR9Ubw) in 7000 hrs (future)

> You can probably keep improving for decades

"Jamie Dimon was an amazingly accomplished financial services
executive at age twenty-nine, but he was much better at fifty, as CEO
of JPMorgan Chase"
