## Let's see if I needed to add something else to the calculations.

Again I am having jitters. What are going to be the exit
opportunities. What If I start working on it and am not suited for the
role and they fire me? what If I start working on it and end up not
liking it? but why will that be?

And I will also be starved for money... I think... cause I will be
earning 50k. 50k is not bad according to dutch stds.

And lastly is it awesome though?

Plus the idea of working on two things at the same time is such a
collossal wastage of resources. and then you are forgetting the
cahnges of making it to the US.

Then I can write this...? or not, then I want to look for jobs
again... :(

## What info to get?

	- What successful people have done
	- Offer services as an intern
	- What steps do I need to take to become "GiveWell Researcher
      Material".

	How sure are you that you know what skills to train?
	
	How many orgs are there to apply? even?
	
	With what belief are you going inside?
	
2. Get data science procedure and then rock on.

## Reaching out to people in the past

I did for 

I found "similar people" (people with same exp) in the business, And
saw how they made. I have tried something like this in the ea forum
with my questions post to find people, maybe reach out to those exact
people on what you should do to become GIVEWELL material... They were
quite happy to give you feedback, I think you should atleast reach out
to them.


Next

Through that you also find mentor type people... 

There is Peter of course, and then there is 


[From this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but), there are

2. saulius

Hi Saulius, 

You have been working at RP for about 3 years now. I want to get a
researcher job like you in a top org like RP, GIVEWELL or OPP. I was
wondering what I can do to get there. What would be your suggestions
or skills to work on.

From this post, I gather that you wrote articles criticizing some work
from ACE and 

ASk Micheal St Jules

A typical job at RP or FP involves, 
- making Cost-Effectiveness estimates, prioritizing cause areas,
finding best funding opportunities aka independent research.
- course on GH&P at JPAL
- I could also do summary posts
- improve writing? reasoning transparency
- apply to assistant jobs, volunteer jobs
- work on "statistics" internal and external validity? "solid
  understanding of causal links" while understanding assumptions
- or work on data analysis?
- or work on forecasting
- review other materials
- "critically" review released material.
- Bayesian thinking

What do you are the steps one needs to work on to become "givewell
material"

Corollary, what are the skills that make up a great EA researcher.

what would you work on? what do you expect others to focus on?

I want to know what skills to train myself in

### Saulius

Hi Saulius, 

I am coming from [this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but?commentId=AiZ96d7trvcBh9jMg), where you commented that what took
you from being rejected to being accepted in an EA org as a researcher
was probably your two articles you wrote on improving Animal lives. In
addition you said you criticized ACE's work pointing out something
that you thought was wrong.

~~What are the "concrete" skills that RP would be interested in?~~

Hi Saulius,

I am trying to make a plan of what I would need to do to bring myself
to the level of "RP GIVEWELL or OPP researcher". I would like to ask
you for your help/advice.

It appears that now you are in RP for almost 3 years. I was wondering
what steps you would suggest an OLD YOU (pre-ACE Saulius) to take to
become an "RP Researcher"? Writing independent research and critically
evaluating work of other orgs seem to be two things that stand out
from your comments [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but?commentId=AiZ96d7trvcBh9jMg).

Please let me know. Thank You very much for your time.

**A bit about me** Am 30 years old, Ex-mechanical engineer, recently
moved to a Data Analyst role in ASML and I am trying to break-into
EA. This is my blog: [agent18.github.io](http://agent18.github.io/). I got rejected recently
from an RP round after the personal interview.

Hi MSJ,

Hope you are doing good.

I am trying to make a plan of what I would need to do to bring myself
to the level of "RP GIVEWELL or OPP researcher". I would like to ask
you for your help/advice.

It appears that now you are a fellow at RP. Congrats on that. I was
wondering what steps you would suggest me (or a pre-CE MSJ) to take to
become an "RP Researcher"? You have earlier suggested that you had
written a Forum Prize article, been active in the EA Forum and started
to run a local EA group [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but?commentId=DivnrA7BNq68xddWf). Now that you have much more
experience, what steps would you suggest a pre-CE MSJ to take to get
into EA research roles.

Please let me know. Thank You very much for your time.

Hi MSJ,

Thank you for your reply.

> position. Was this what you applied to? Or the internship earlier?

It was this position: [Staff Researcher GH&P](https://web.archive.org/web/20210614134506/https://rethinkpriorities.applytojob.com/apply/hMArA0IVxM/Staff-Researcher-Global-Health-And-Development), after that I dared
not to apply to the Survey position. Congrats on your new offer
man. Are you going to take it?

**My Takeaways from your message are:**  
- Start with an internship. I will keep a lookout for RP's internship opening.
- Do a literature review or Cost-Effectiveness analysis on some
  EA-related topic (Look at Saulius's work).
- For survey related roles use Mixed-Models and reproduce "EA Survey
  Analysis" and find other insights from the data.
- There is another survey on wild animal suffering which needs
  analysis, and you can help me with the getting the data. Correct?
  
I will check back with you about the wild animal suffering survey data
if I intend to start on it. I am more inclined to do a literature
review or a CE analysis. Any other suggestions?

Regards,
Thej

### Gregory

Hi Gregory,

Hope you are doing good.

I am trying to make a plan of what I would need to do to bring myself
to the level of "RP GIVEWELL or OPP researcher". Not that this is
where I should be, but that this is the standard I would like to try to
bring myself to. I would like to ask you for your help/advice.

You had earlier suggested [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but?commentId=gv9XEmWJPhPnwBPN9) that one should atleast have a
backup when apping to competitive EA positions. Thanks for that, I
have now moved to a Data Analyst role to keep that as a backup.

I was wondering what steps you would suggest me (or a pre-2015
Gregory) to take to become an "EA Researcher"? I understand from your
comment [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but?commentId=gv9XEmWJPhPnwBPN9) that you think your medical and public health
background landed you your position at FHI. But if you have some
advice for me please let me know.

Thank You very much for your time.

### Jamie Harris

Hi Jamie,

Hope you are doing good. We had earlier had discussions
[here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z9x56yiX2ceRZnKTR/a-naive-analysis-on-if-ea-is-talent-constrained?commentId=C37KKuXzfRbthWatZ). Thanks for that.

I am trying to make a plan of what I would need to do to bring myself
to the level of "EA researcher". I would like to ask you for your help/advice.

I was wondering what steps you would suggest to me (or a younger you)
to take to become an "EA Researcher" now? I am aware of the
[Volunteering opportunities listed here](https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/sv-full-list).

Thank You very much for your time. Sorry if this was not the right
channel to use to ask for this information.

apocalypse killed everyone on Earth, leaving the planet simmering in
radiation. Fortunately, there were survivors. Twelve nations had
operational space stations at the time of the bombs. There is now only
the Ark, one station forged from the many.
