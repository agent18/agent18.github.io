### Lastweek tonight

[career-1]:/career.html
[career-2]:/career(2).html
[80k-uur]:https://80000hours.org/
[80k-advice-biggest-problems]:https://80000hours.org/career-guide/world-problems/

Last week we saw [80k-org][80k-uur] suggesting that Earning-to-give might be a good option but we should first consider contributing directly, by working in an effective NGO, doing research, or working for the government, as the sectors are talent-constrained rather than money-constrained. Followed by how to get in...

As our priorities line up with the research done by 80k-org, we consider with this post what is needed and if it is possible for us to contribute directly. We form a prelimnary analysis as suggested by [80k-org][80k-uur].

### Applying to your own career

[80k-org][80k-uur] suggests the following to deal with each global problem listed in their website:

>For each problem, list out some specific career options you could take that would help the problem. You can get ideas in our profiles, as well as further reading on each area. Also remember you can contribute to any problem area through donations and advocacy, even if it’s not the focus of your day job. -advice of [80k-world-problems][80k-advice-biggest-problems]

So for lack of any better way to reduce the list of global problems, I took the 8k-org survey that allows us to prioritize the issues according to your current knowledge.

Out of this came,
- Global priorities research
- Health in under-developed countries
- AI

This is a short list of where I could work, considering my current knowedge that I fed into the system. I looked at each one of them and this is what they need.

#### Global priorities research

Global priorities research is about figuring out which global problem has higher priority.

>For example, if a foundation wants to improve others’ lives as much as possible, should it focus on immigration policy, international development, scientific research or something else? Or if the government of India wants to spur economic development, should it focus on improving education, healthcare, microeconomic reform, or something else?

Most needed are researchers, and in particular:

>Researchers trained in economics, mathematics, or philosophy to develop the methodology for setting global priorities.
Researchers trained in social and natural sciences with the ability to collect data and analyse specific global problems.
and people who can do research and manegirial works.

The idea with other complimentary positions, is to be of real high impact by helping other researchers and the research group to keep focus and prioritize what is important. You could also do research and publish as a result.

But, I don't have an economics degree/math/philosophy. In fact economics is something that I have never done. Managing I guess I have done in parts. I have never really done it though, other than organising events and some leadership roles here and there. I am NOT a natural leader, I don't always lead, it depends on the 'status' at a location. If people are indecisive, I can tell them what to do.

Earning-to-give is an option here, but is not really the bottleneck.

If you want to work in this area as a researcher, you’ll need training in the relevant disciplines.

>If you are an undergraduate, you can major in, or take classes in mathematics, economics, statistics, or analytic philosophy. If you are out of university, you can take online classes in these subjects, for example this [introduction to microeconomics](https://smart.ly/course/learn-microeconomics-i-supply--demand--smartly/95437d2a-0211-4899-825d-e2107c6729e6).

This seems like a good option to at least grasp something about economics, to see how it is, to get a feel etc...

>In general, the best graduate subject is an Economics PhD. Other useful subjects include statistics, applied maths and public policy.

Economics Phd, seems out of question for now, because, even if I do courses, why would any one give me a phd. If this is what I really need to do, I should at least jump careers I guess, work for a year or 2 and with that experience apply for a masters/phd and go to the US. Hopefully, with the option of either working to make money and later getting into places where I am most needed. But looking at the long term it might be worth it. As the industry is talent constrained. If I am able to position myself in good place, then I could create large impact.


**Summary**

Excluding Earning-to-give for now, it appears that this problem needs economists, mathematicians or philosophers. More preferred are Phd's in Economics. However, for me to contribute it seems quite a stretch. Of course I am young and could take an introduction to microeconomics course and see what it is all about. Although, I am not confident anyone is interested in giving a masters in engineering a phd in Economics, even if I really wanted. However when push comes to shove, I guess I can figure out something. An economics degree has much more advantages than just working in the NGO's. If shit hits the roof one could alsoe fall back on other options like working for a proper paying job in a for-profit organization.


**Example career path**

- Do online course, try to get a job for a year  and try to apply for phd or masters economics/statistics/mathematics. And go on from there,

> if you get through, you have a high chance of landing a good research job in academia or policy – promising areas for social impact – and you have back-up options in the corporate sector since the skills you learn are in-demand (unlike many PhD programs). You should especially consider an economics PhD if you want to go into research roles, are good at math (i.e. quant GRE score above 165) and have a proven interest in economics research.

I didn't have 165 but I had 157 or something. I am sure I can train it. I am sure I am jumping to conclusions and that I can find my motivation just as 80k hrs says, "People grow to like other things as well".

ToDo: profile on different careers. I want to start there.

#### Health in poor countries

> Every year around ten million people in poorer countries die of illnesses that can be very cheaply prevented or managed, including malaria, HIV, tuberculosis and diarrhoea. Tens of millions more suffer from persistent undernutrition or parasitic diseases that cause them to be less mentally and physically capable than they otherwise would be.

>Options for working on the problem include serving as a donor to effective projects, working as an economist in intergovernmental organizations such as the World Bank or World Health Organization, or starting or working in a non-profit that scales up proven treatments.

Wow, is economics king? Everywhere they seem to need economists. I could be that economist. No points for guessing that somehow an economics phd will help!

>What skill sets and resources are most needed?
The ability to fundraise large sums, or move money within bureaucracies to better projects.
People with on-the-ground logistical skills in international development (i.e. the kind of person who could get 100,000 malaria nets distributed in Africa).
Entrepreneurs (mostly in non-profits but also sometimes for-profits) who could found one of these charities.
Development economists and cost-effectiveness researchers, including economists, statisticians and disease control experts.
Money to fund GiveWell recommended charities.
We think that people capable of starting outstanding projects in this area are likely to be able to attract the necessary funding, making the area mostly talent constrained.

**Career paths**

- Plan a career around founding a new global health non-profit
- Researcher at Give well
- Fundraising large sums of money or move money within bureaucracies to better projects
- Development economists and cost-effectiveness researchers, including economists, statisticians and disease control experts.
- Grantmaker at Bill and melinda gates foundation
- biomedical researcher

Of course donating is an option, but it needs to be evaluated what could be my contribution. For example, maybe I can hire two econometricians to work on this topic for me. How about that! Just like Global priorities research, money is not the bottleneck here, if there is an option to do other work with greater impact then that should be priority.

#### Artificail intelligence

Looking at [this video][ai-video] it definitely puts the fear of AI into everybody. The arguments made are strong. A gist is that AI has all the necessary ingredients to become the next industrial revolution. As in, the growth would be super quick, once stable AI is made that can think for itself. The issue lies in understanding what should be the morals of an AI. 'Cause the AI can quickly become too powerful as it has an almost infinite memory and it can possibly not be controlled. When wielded right it could solve a great deal of problems.

The jist is that one could work on
- Technical research, that is quite talent constrained
- Strategy and policy research
- Complementary roles --> Academic Project manager
- Advocacy and capacity building --> Research management

Looking at this the picture I get is that I can't really work for AI in say tech research as I have no programming background what so ever. I am not sure its a personal fit. I can probably work in a managerial role, a role that brings huge funding and the like. Econometricians don't seem to have a role here, but policy makers and the like are needed.

Earning to give is an option. There seems to be a surplus with big institutions that would typically get academic funding, but there is hardly any with orgs like MIRI. Donating to them is still an option.

#### Summary of what I could do for each problem

Overall it appears to me that there are two types of work, you can do. One is to earn-to-give. And the other is everything else. Everything else involves things like, doing techinical research or other research (like GiveWell), supporting NGO's as an economist, founding charities and working on other complimentary roles in NGO's that create high impact.

80k-org suggests to try to contribute directly before considering Giving-what-we-can. Right now giving-what-we-can seems to be the quickest thing I can do. By that I mean that I can already do it. If the above roles listed in each of the profiles are important and the need of the hour, then I better start looking at each of them and see which one will suit me and in which I will have the biggest chance of success. Something like chance of success multiplies by impact should allow me to decide what I should work on.

I will continue reading 80k-org website and move on to the other important things like Career-Capital. It seems wise to develop skills and work in managing institutions that are responsible for large impact. Also to consider in that case would be jumping career and my current capital being earned.

It is also important that...

>Just as we saw with choosing a problem, this means the most effective approach for you will be something you enjoy, that motivates you, and is a good fit for your skills. We sometimes come across people tempted to do a job they’d hate in order to have more impact. That’s likely a bad idea, since they’ll just burn out. Their example could also discourage others from doing good.

### Approaches to EA

There are four approaches to EA.
- Earning to give
- advocacy
- research
- direct working

#### Earning to give

A well known way, wherein you donate a part of your salary. I have talked about this in earlier posts.

ToDo: Understand which job allows you to give the most, and what is feasible for me from my current scenario.

#### Advocacy

Sort of like preaching or spreading the word, is advocacy.

>In fact, there’s reason to think that advocacy is typically better than earning to give. One reason for this is that everyone wants more money so there’s a lot of competition, which places a limit on how much you can easily earn (and subsequently donate). There’s a lot less competition to spread good ideas, for the reasons we just discussed. So we expect that it would be possible for many people to influence more money than they could donate.

>Taking a stable job and doing advocacy part time can be effective because you don’t need to worry about funding your advocacy, which helps you to stay independent and take bigger risks. You’ll also be seen as more impartial.

>Finally, you’ll be in a better position to advocate for attention to pressing problems if you’re successful in your field, because you’ll be more credible and make more influential connections. So sometimes the best path for advocacy is just to enter the field where you have the greatest chances of success.

Not sure how much I am suited for this or will be in the future. It's one of the things I don't want to do, having met people in general and the real low probability for me to convert people. I tried it in my days just after de-converting from religion. The point is no one seems to respond to logic. If that is the case then, I can barely do any good. I have tried speaking to quite some people, and people are hell bent in their own ways and don't respond to logic or give you shit logic in return.

I see myself pushing many people I know in the near future, pushing people to atleast do 1 or 2%. 10% is a huge stretch for these people. It's as though I almost speak about "these people" in contempt.  Maybe, when I see people(including me) talking about useless things as though life depended only on this, and forgetting a whole world just on the other side that is burning.

#### Research

>If you might be a top 10% researcher in a pressing problem area, then it’s likely to be the highest impact path for you.

You can probably get there. People are at their peaks in their 40's. Everything takes time and it is possible to gain interest in new activities or fields. But then it comes down to personal fit. I liked the status quo of being a researcher. If not given the weight of "having to run for another 5 years on the same thing", I wouldn't mind doing it. Although I got a mere 7.5/10, it is not representative of my hardwork, amount of work done in short span given the guidance I had, or the actual work done in the project. I think I could do it, but 80k-org is not talking about doing a phd in some seemingly useless topic in mechanical engineering.

A research job in a pressing problem area? like working as a researcher for GiveWell, could very well be an option. I am a hardworker, and I will put all the energy necessary to learn at the job. I could also gain enough career capital and then jump to NGO's. In order to do this, jumping into what a GiveWell profile expects would be a good start.

In some essence it is problem solving, gathering data and making sense out of it, and explaining to an audience without biases. It is in a small way what I do now at work. I look at what data I need, look for it, compile all the info I have to make an informed choice. DS of some sorts.

Seems promising, will add it to the job profiles I plan to do for next week.

Also one could work in supporting roles such as academic admin.

>If you’re interested in these positions, the best path is usually to pursue a PhD, pick a field, then apply to research groups.

Doesn't sound like something I would be interested in, but I would need to look into it as well as part of the job profiles I plan to write about next week.

### Direct working

Starting a charity that focuses on neglected (hence high impact) areas (ex: sms for vaccinations in India after 6 months of research) is one example. Anything you do that impacts the problem area directly is Direct working I guess.

>Finally, direct work can be for-profit as well as non-profit. For instance, Send Wave enables African migrant workers to transfer money to their families through a mobile app for fees of 3%, rather than 10% fees with Western Union. So for every $1 of revenue they make, they make some of the poorest people in the world several dollars richer. They’ve already had an impact equivalent to donating millions of dollars, and they’re growing quickly. The total size of the market is hundreds of billions of dollars, and several times larger than all aid spending. If they can slightly accelerate the roll out of cheaper ways to transfer money, it’ll have a big impact.

>One mistake people make is trying to work out which organizations are needed from their armchair, or by choosing an issue that they’ve happened to come across in their own lives. Instead, go and learn about big, neglected social problems. Take a job in the area, do further study and speak to lots of people working on the problem, to find out what the world really needs. You need to get near the edge of an area before you’ll spot the ideas others haven’t, and have the connections you’ll need to execute.

Planning already to do something specific and gaining skills is one way, but things can change in time. I keep thinking I should focus on career capital, instead of focusing on choosing what I should exactly do right away.

TBC in another post

<!--

### right approach for you?

>The first thing to note is that these four approaches are not exclusive, and you can do more than one at the same time. For instance, a teacher helps their students (direct impact), but could also develop new educational techniques (research) or tell their students about pressing problems (advocacy). We know a teacher who did private tutoring in order to donate more (earning to give). As we’ve seen, often your impact is more about how you use your position than the position itself. This means, you’ll want to look for the positions that offer the best balance of ways to contribute directly, through advocacy and through donations. In our career reviews, we assess each path on these three ways of contributing.

>Third, do something where you have the chance to excel. Throughout this article, there is a vital general principle to bear in mind: the most successful people in a field have far more impact than the typical career.

>Just as we saw with choosing a problem, this means the most effective approach for you will be something you enjoy, that motivates you, and is a good fit for your skills. We sometimes come across people tempted to do a job they’d hate in order to have more impact. That’s likely a bad idea, since they’ll just burn out. Their example could also discourage others from doing good.

>An outstanding charity worker will likely do more good than a mediocre engineer earning to give, and the reverse is also true.

>On the other hand, as we’ve seen, people often underestimate how easily they can become interested in new jobs.

>If you already have expertise in an area, then that should also be factored in. We have more specific advice broken down by area here, as well as in the career reviews and problem profiles.
http://wiki.80000hours.org/index.php/Advice_by_expertise

### summary

Moreover, if you focus on the approaches that are best suited to the problems you want to solve and where you have the best personal fit, you can do even more good again. And you can do this while having a more satisfying career too.


#### things i could do

1. Plan a career in managing founding companies.

My friend in holland does things like this. Once he hits his success, I will get involved with him. Even for earning-to-give, founding and making money seems to be an option. He has soms contacts in india, who I should meet just to get an idea of what would be possible, if I can start as an apprentice/mentee to someone killing it in business.

2. Data science
3. Economics degree and then normal job

Taking a normal job after such a jump seems pointless. As DS seems to be much more viable option withe more money in it.

4. Economics degree and then a job in the NGO's
This makes sense. Seems to be the need of the hour for the NGO's

5. My current job as an engineer in the precision industry.
Not sure about the career capital I have earned and how it will be useful in non-research based precision industries.
More over the growth in this part of the country seems really slow. For example, someone I know working in paypal, got an untimely bonus of 10k$. What! Doens't happen ever in holland.

At the very least need to look at gaining diff career capital and moving to the US

6. Other options could be to do an MBA/finance degree and try getting into Dubai

I have heard stories where people did philosophy phd and who started working in a finance firm donating about a 6 figure salary. So it would be wise to check out their careers or rather what such a career would need.

7. Programming

Something the idea of which feels so awesome. I would love to get into it, but only if this makes sense impact wise.

Don't know how acheivable such a position is especially considering the over crowded and heavy competition for a job.

[80k-approaches-to-EA]:https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/#top
>Apply this to your own career
Before we move on, make an initial short list of high impact careers you could work towards in the long-run. The following steps may help:

Done above

>Decide which two to five problems you think are most pressing.
Find the relevant problem profiles, read the list of career ideas in each profile, and note any that could be a good fit for you.

With Global prio research, careers in research, mathematics and economics seem what is needed. I suppose I could get into each of those, but of course the chance of success and that I am already 26 need to be taken into account. Same with AI and health in poor countries. I have listed some of the profiles I could be doing above.

>Go through the four approaches we covered in this chapter, and list out any other options that could be a good fit for you.
The aim at this point is just to come up with more options. We’ll explain how to further narrow down in an upcoming article.



### Reflection and rant

I am just writing and writing and writing. What is the fucking point. What I want to do is to know reliably what I need to do. The approach on a high level seems alright, but I need to spend time understanding things and classifying thigs. Once I understand the problems or note what each problem needs, I should take a step bakc and evaluate what I can do with specific career options. Maybe I can't get far, but that is what the other parts of the essay are. Right now see your pitfall and see how you can move from there.

Once again, the goal is to first see the topics and what they need. How to get there according to 80k and from there on the feasibility and impact. This was good.

How I will go about the feasibility and impact is fully not clear. That is why I guess I am looking at the impact and induvidual profiles to see if it is going to suit me or not.

Another thing I noticed is that I am doing too much, writing and reading. The task is too tough right now. I also see a certain flow. I was able t work 3 hrs straight, which is pretty decent for my stds. I have never really worked so much. I should look to cash in on this type of work. Come early and start early is the key.No pressure. I want to get work done. There is so much of unknown and so much work to do.

In the sprit of deal that I made, I want to reduce the deal such that I do lesser words when I am having to do research. and also reading 10k is almost impossible and leads stright to failure. However, 6k seeems possible.  In the sprit of the deal, I aproove of these choices as I have clocked good hours.

Another thing I should probably consider is about writing well.


My grade of 7.5/10 for my master thesis is not representative of the work I put in or the success of my project. The research direction didn't come from me, as I barely had experience in it. I trusted the faculty to give me a good assignment. Unfortunately, it was more about taking an idea and implementing it to see if it works. Went quite deep into linear algebra. I did a lot of coding, and read a lot of papers. Did everything I could with my time to solve the issue. I dived heavily into the theory, but unfortunately, I didn't think of some fundamental things that questioned the need of my research or the use of it. My goal was not to do research unfortunately, my goal was to learn from the best and learn as much as I could. I spent several hours a day working on python, I spent several months understanding the fundamentals and why things came about. But I do think I am work slow (citation needed, compared to what?)

My point is I learn quick, I work hard when I have a personal stake in the situation. I am sure I can step up and with long time spent on it I can definitely kill. Every extra hour I spend at work would mean more impact and that would be life, essentially. So great.

My current boss thinks I work fast, I pick up things quickly. He didn't expect me to finish the project I had started at the beginning of the job within one month, but guess what. I stepped in for several projects and delivered results according to him at pretty good speed. From knowing nothing in a project, I have delivered, and I continue to deliver, its everyday bro.



An idea could be during the month that I am in india, I could do a course in economics and a course in data science. I am quite inclined to do these as it would free me from the burden of writing. and I honestly wouldn't mind working on these for 4 hrs a day even. Have some pretty decent deadlines and in those 36 days actually crack something.


So, early career, the ideal is to find a job that offers both impact and career capital, but if forced to choose between the two, lean towards career capital.

This doesn’t mean ignoring social impact – it’s best to stay involved through volunteering, conferences, donating 1-10%, and so on, so you stay motivated and keep learning. And if you come across an especially good opportunity for impact, then it might be better to focus on that. Rather, the question is where to put your focus most of the time.

And thats why we move on to Career capital

---

### Career captial

>The safest jobs are those that involve creativity, high level problem solving, and social intelligence, such as: management, marketing, social work, and engineering.

>In general, the more uncertain you are about the future and your career, the more important it is to gain career capital that’s flexible. One consequence of this is that flexibility is usually most important at the start of your career. At this point you haven’t tried any jobs, so it’s the point when you know the least about what you want to do in the future.

>If you’re really uncertain, then you could make flexible career capital your main focus. As you learn more, you can make your plan more and more targeted. (We’ll cover how to do this in a later article.)

>Just pick an area, perform highly, learn valuable skills, and meet influential people. You’ll end up in a better position than if you try to do a bit of everything and don’t achieve anything.

Consulting jobs

Sales and marketting at ASML?

Investment banking

 If you have relatively good quantitative skills, then consider sales and trading or asset management in investment banking.

>In general, however, we prefer consulting to these options because: (i) it’s growing, whereas these industries are flat and have a worse outlook (ii) it seems to give you a wider range of options (iii) the work is often more engaging at the early levels (though often still boring!) (iv) you get to explore several industries (v) there are better arguments that some parts of law and banking are harmful. Law also requires an expensive up-front investment.

Jack and master of none?

Economics-> one stop option to money, policy, social sciences, academia and social impact

>Dillon couldn’t imagine studying anything except philosophy. Then he found out about the research that shows that our interests can easily change.
https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/

https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/dillon-bowen/ very interesting profile!

Programming?

>e know lots of examples of people who started with no technology background, and within six months ended up with highly paid programming jobs they enjoy far more than their old jobs. Programming is also a growing, in-demand skill that can be used in many areas. Bootcamps are intensive, three-month programmes that aim to get you a job as soon as possible.


Speak to rajesh, how to move to US, options to consider, sales and marketting


>But you don’t need to become an entrepreneur. You can build these “soft” aspects of career capital in almost any job if you perform well. Doing great work builds your reputation, and that allows you to make connections with other high achievers. If you push yourself to do great work, then you’ll probably learn more too.

>There are plenty of cases where someone has turned success in one field into success in another by using the reputation and connections they gained. For instance, Sheryl Sandberg started in consulting, then worked in the Treasury, and is now COO at Facebook.

>This means that if you want to build career capital, it’s worth considering any area where you have good fit, even if it doesn’t seem like a good option in general.

>If you care about social impact, then it’s especially useful to have achievements that involve doing good. It’ll mean you meet people who deeply care about social impact, and that will be more useful than knowing lots of accountants.

>Although we like stories of those who achieved apparently instant fame and early success, like the Forbes 30 under 30, they’re not the norm. Besides those who got lucky, behind most great achievements are many years spent diligently building expertise.

Very important! We are looking at years of work.

>We’ve seen people transform their careers by doing things like learning to program, being mentored by the right boss, and going to the right graduate school.

#### Applying to your career

>Go over all the four paths to career capital and ways to gain career capital in any job, and note down three new ways you could gain career capital.


>Can you work at a high-performance, growing organization?

Not sure what is meant by high-performance. One of my friends works in Portugal, in a DS company. The company is growing, as in hiring new people to start branches in other parts of the world. People usually clock 12 hrs per day I heard. Seems to be a high-performance, growing organization. Another company which is into aerospace consulting, which has very few people is growing and expanding in a variety of regions in the world.

Considering the above examples, I am not sure I have the chance to gain career capital in a highperformance organization. My current work is in a startup, which will either be worth billions in 2 years or not at all. There is no high performance. Everyone is relaxed, atleast in my team. It feels like a government company. I spend a good amount of time doing manual labour to collect data, than actually doing some high-level thinking. This seems to be a flag, that I should watch out for, considering I am in my prime and don't want to be part of simple stuff. Although, they are giving me more responsibility with milestones which is making me work harder.

>Do you have a good option for graduate study?

Maybe.  I am referring to doing a Masters. I have already done a masters in TU Delft, in precision engineering. if I need to move to DS, it might be worth considering to do a masters in the US.

>Can you do something that will teach you a valuable skill?

I could do some courses online in CS, DS, and Economics. Doing courses in DS seem to be a nice way to start in other companies.
Same as CS I guess. I have read in the DS profile regarding just a course being enough to start at a DS company.

It could be an option to also look at marketing and sales.

Being social is something I want to be more good at. With women I find it especially hard to make conversations, unless I am inebriated. As I look at the 80k-org website, I get the impression that this (being social) could also help. Keep and maintain contacts.

Maybe I could join the event organizing team in my company, or join some group outside to spurr more social moving.

>Is there an option where you’ll achieve something impressive, especially if relevant to social impact?

Nope.


>What’s the most valuable career capital you already have? Identifying your most valuable career capital can give you clues about what you’ll be best at, and help you to convince employers to hire you. Review each of the categories:
Skills, which you can break down into (i) transferable skills, (ii) knowledge, and (iii) personality traits,

i) Transferable skills: ability to solve problems of all sorts, some trouble shooting experience and giving support to other organizations. Programming skills from 7months of python, some leadership skills from being the chairman of the student board, design for better assembly and function skills, ability to work on unknown problems and come up to speed asap.

ii) knowledge

Design, dynamics, mechanical engineering basically, FEM, programming,

iii)

Social, Leadership (sometimes), obsession over problem at work, punctual, Determination and persistance, Eager and willing to add to my base skills, ability to co-work well. My co-workers like working with me.


Connections

I know almost all the professors in my department really well. Some of them are famous for their work in their respective fields. I know a big guy in Denso Germany, who got me an interview last time, very friendly guy. And some others in my field and my peers. I worked at a startup and know these people quite well. I know my CTO quite well. I am currently discussing with him regarding my milestone for the company. In india I am still connected to my professors from IIT. I know some startup guys from the my time studying gate and being in IIT.

Credentials:
I am a masters degree holder, with a gate rank of 1061 (98.96 percentile), in one of the popular universities in the world.
