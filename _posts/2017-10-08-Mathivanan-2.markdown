#### Motivation

Motivation is given by the following equation:

  $ Motivation = Capacity * (value of feedback/reward/punishment) / delay in reward

This simple equation houses much more than getting the motivation needed to do things you don't like.


#### Flow talk by Mihaly

Mihaly talks about this thing called flow. Defined as a very nice state of happiness, that lasts. Unlike say eating a chocolate. This is deeply connected to our good friend motivation. When you are in flow, you want to do more of that activity giving you flow. You do it out of your own will, there is no obligation. Time flies by you, you don't feel the minutes or the hours anymore. You are in a state of deep concentration. You are in your own world. All the problems, pain you have cannot be focussed on because you dont have anymore ram to do other stuff. You get right feedback from moment to moment that keeps you wanting to live in this matrix. Your challenge and skill level need to be complementary.

Flow is basically a fancy way to say that you have great motivation to keep doing something.

Example: Games, playing sports, chess, figure skating, managing a company, trouble-shooting, art such as painting, etc...

I have experienced flow in the following activities.

#### Examples Meeting flow
Take examples and show how each activity creates/doesn't create the flow meeting all the characteristics.

Also add in it examples of things you think in your life and how you can improve it.

key characteristics on flow
  Immediate feedback to ones actions!  
  Clear goals every step of the way. This is quite wague.
  balance between skills and challenges

Secondary characteristics, I picked up from the talk:
  Activity is no more an obligation
  High focus
  Time stops for you
  You can keep doing it for long Time
  You can't think about other problems in your life.
  In apathy you have no skills and you feel like you are just a lump. Anxiety you are overwhelmed. You dont feel either of those.
  stopping doing an activity is a characteristic?
  you would want to not be distracted by phone
  Not a chore

Mihaly first says flow can be achieved by people who have a good 10 years of experience doing something.
Get into this a little later
#### Mihaly activities

Mountain climbers get immediate feedback. Mihaly says, every step they take they know they did it right, because they didn't fall. They seem to have clear goals all of the way. That they need to scale the mountain by making the right hand movements to help them succeed. Last but not the least, I guess one has balance between the skill and the challenge by choosing a mountain to scale that is withing his level.

Piano players get immediate feedback by playing the right note. Say you want to cover something like Chopins 'Nocturne in C # minor', as you play the right notes you get the feedback and it is immediate. I guess the goal while practicing is to get it right. The goal while playing at a concert is still the same. The goal while playing it foryourself is also the same. This is where we need to talk about the '10 years to develop flow'. I guess the idea is that at the beginning, it would be hard to play songs and get things right. I guess it is a play of all the 3 key characteristics. In the beginning if your goal is play chopin, you are going to fail. You fail with Challenges >> Skill. I suspect it should still be possible to motivate one self to do something, by matching the challenge and skill. Say taking a really simple piece for example. The clear definition of a goal, can still be to get as many notes as you can right keeping in mind the balance of skill and challenge. Your goal is to play the song one note at a time.

I would assume for jordan rudess, it is definitely not a chore, not an obligation. Sure it could help to see the end of the tunnel with the audience clapping for you. But without immediate feedback it appears from what mihaly says that you are nothing. Boredom is highly underated. Imagine dogs, how bored they would feel being inside the home all the time. Anyways. Jordan, rahman, illayaraja, the people who have crossed the initial hurdle are constantly in flow. I can only speculate to an extent how they feel.

I was also a pianist of some degree. My long term motivation was clear. Impress girls. I didn't keep at playing the keyboard. I didn't practice as much as I needed. It was a bloody chore. It was boring, time would not fly by. All the negative parts of it are coming to my mind. I did at some point take a chopin piece to play, but it fucking took too long before I finished it. And by the end I lost motivation. This is silly. How did jordan get there in the first place, without motivation from within? Knowing that long term motivations don'. First I was definitely not past the 10 year mark (this I think should be read as 10k hours/ pro). But thats ok. Many times I remeber going to my master and talking about re-booting. The initial fire doens't last. The motivation non-existant. I will tell my master I will practice for 3 hrs/ day. My foot only I did. It was hard it was painful. It was boring time did not move. Why? I had to jsut keep practicing the scales over and over again. Where did I lose? I think I lost in all the points. immediate feedback went stright to hell. I could play notes right, playing it consistantly over a period of time was the goal. Maybe I didn't realize it much. Maybe challenge was litte. For example, if I wanted to get to a particular tempo in a scale, probably doing a tempo that I could just reach would keep me motivating. with the clear goal being to imporve speed.

My master said he practiced for 6 mother fucking hrs everyday, and he started so late. How did he do it? Why couldn't I do it? Motivation. Assuming that what mihaly says is the word of the genius, it appears that I looked at it as a chore. I didn't bother to match my the skill adn challenge level. I could have used tempos to assist me clearly in showing me the progress. but I don't know, I would try a couple of things and see what works, kepingthis in mind.

I didn't have motivation to play chopin. I wanted to impress this girl. I decided I was going to play chopin by the end of the month. I wanted to proactice everyday, but I couldn't. Could the challenge level be higher. But I couldn't practice for more than 1 hr for sure. It was not easy, I neever really got to playing it fully, just in parts and often sucked at it. On playing the right notes it probably felt good, but I feel like I want to blame the challenge and skill balance. If I didn't get it and it didn't motivate me to get back on it, I wasn't clearly getting enough +ve feedback. Choosing a piece that was easy and slowly upgrading could have made a difference. But I guess we will never know. In summary, I suspect it to be the lack of balance between skill adn ahallenge. Although I didn't feel anxiety, I for sure as hell didn't feel boredom, probably frustration that I can't get this shit right. Alwasy with mistakes. Chewing more than I can, leading to lot of negative feedback. I guess.

Gate exam,, reading,... studying,,, Even now if I think of doing a course, I am for some reason stuck with positve thoughtts about it. Its going to amazing, I going to have many courses, projects, everything that will keep testing me I guess. That will keep making me better, adn most of all challenging.

Playing basketball. I seem to never want to put down the ball. It's the others who make me put down the ball. I want to keep playing. Usually the time of playing is around 2 to 3 hrs easily. No stress, just playing playing, playing, exhausted but still playing playing playing. I am not a great player, but I have clocked in quite some hours, and I suspect from there on it is the right mix of feedback, challenge, and delay.  Sometimes it is boring, maybe you don't get the ball much, maybe your opponents are not that good. In that case, it might be boring. Today for example, there was a team that was really good. All players, pushing agressive and stuff. The teams were almost the right match. Man did I want to play with them more. The growth from playing with them, or scoring points with them is much more sweeter.

Basketball, gives you immedite feedback with every right move you do I guess (extrapolating from the climbing and piano example). The goal is to beat the opponent. You could do that by making a cunning pass, a shot from far away, or a nice fake on your opponent, blocking your opponent, disabling your opponent from moving about, making eye contact with your team mate to get a screen and moving from then on. There are so many things I think. And I suspect the goal of this excercise to not be about discovering the feedback modes. It could be anything and everything that is done right. Here I guess the clear overall goal is to put your opponents to shame. And sometimes it doesn't even matter to lose. Huh! It matters to have a great game. You see what I am saying! Good game > winning. A game with crazy flow, is worth. Of course playinf for points with additional rewards of contiuing to play if we won, keeps the end goal more real and forces us to play more seriously, I suspect increasing flow. In the end of the day, such are going to be my speculations. But I think it is a fact that having points really drives us to play better or more seriously. I suspect forcing us to be better versions of ourselves. Everyone upping their game, difficulty goes up and flow is restored,... Possibly

It seems to have all the secondary characteristics of flow. Time stops for you. You don't care for distractions.

How would you imporve your flow in ball?
M obvious answer seems to be get better, practice more, learn more creative team playing. The follow up to this would be how does this increase the feedback. Practicing different shots, would all you I guess to be a much bigger threat to the opponent. People might actually attempt to block you, when you can run in and score (feedback). If you can make a shot escaping all hands in the air, that will give you feedback. Being better would I think imply that we create better chances for positive feedback, less chances of screw ups. Imagine screwing up on the simplest shot. Thats what I am talking about. Moving fast such that your opponent cant track you (feedback). Its a fast game, so you often get the ball. so you have things to gain, by improving yourself, I can't imagine a scenario otherwise.

I don't think the goal is to guess which are the right feedback parameters, well the goal is to guess and test it out and figure out how to improve your motivation.

Youtube video watching/facebook browsing/TV viewing

Mihaly says this is not flow, he quotes this as a state of apathy, for the fact that it requires absolutely no skill level what so ever, and the chances of feedback are low. For example, if you really wanted to watch GOT, apparently you get feedback. Every step you are expecting something to happen, or you don't know whats going to happen, the more you know what happens, the more you are satisfied. I guess this could be considered as feedback. I guess its more complicated than this. I am finding it hard to say what exactly could be the feedback source. And distinguishing between flow and apathy. Can Youtube just be a type of flow that gives someone very poor feeling of flow?

But I am able to do this for long hours! But I feel like a lump. You do this when you have nothing else to do. Get this, you would definitely do other better things such as playing if you had the chance. The feedback that you get could be the things that make you laugh. Why else would you do something. But it is definitely not as good as the other flow activities. And it certainly doesn't challenge you.

Everyday, after all my work, I do all my duties for the night and come to bed to watch some particular youtube vlogs, which I find entertaining. Is this flow?

I watch modern family while eating, I love to watch it. Is it flow?

There was a time when everyday I would finish all my work well within time to watch big boss tamil (;)) for 1 hr everyday. Is that flow?

All of the above are not chores. they are not an obligation. time goes by really fast in all cases. Even when I gen watching youtube. Facebook scrolling feels like shit. I waste tons of time on it, for lack of any other better thing to do.  I think I will leave it at this and move on.

As mihaly puts it, it doesn't seem to be flow. Just watching some random youtube videos is not flow. But say when you really want to watch something and you get feedback with every second. I would suspect tv the whole craze about GOT, and all the people watching it every week as soon as it is out, do expereince flow. 1 hr runs like that for them.
Contrast to normal tv viewing

But Mihaly says some bad things about youtube. Its not an obligation, but you can continue to keep doing it for long. Well, I find it boring, to do that. In other words I find it much interesting to play. Maybe just logans or marks vlogs, where I really enjoy looking at somethings, but when I have nothing to do, browsing facebook adn youtube seem to me that I am not in flow. Of course, time flies by faster than in writing! ;) but as mihaly says,...


What is youtube?
Well that is just when you are lonely, its not flow, but apath

effect of long term goals


Its clear according to mihaly. Long term goals might help, but it is really important to receive feedback from moment to moment like while working out, like while fucking programming (its very nice for begnners too, tell me why? unlike playing the piano), like while doing cardio with speedometer? ;). When writing and you keep getting new new ideas (feedback), from moment to moment. Nah mean? or when you need to write n words in n minutes, but you get feedback for every 5 minutes. It keeps you on your toes.

#### next
Ok so we see different activites that are able to give flow. In my life I think they are basketball, sometimes at work while working on a challenging problems, maybe while talking to friends, working out, cardio, writing. They are not perfect, atleast these are the ones that I would like to improve.    
>Hypothesis "AS soon as I associate time with things time instead of better masure, I am fucked"
> hypothesis 2 " hours are limiting. imagine all the tasks that you do in your life that has flow"

#### Challenge vs skills
To the end once you have met these criteria, we look at where flow actually stands between challenges and skills. The narrow band of region which is available in along the diagonal of the 'Challenge-skill' is the point of flow. More challenging than what your skills can handle, will get you to a state of anxiety and not flow. More skill compared to challenge leads to boredom. This is the 110 bits thing. When you need more bits, you are anxious, and loose flow, and kills your motivation. When you need less bits to do something, you are bored and still loose flow.

#### Applying to writing.

I remember the time when writing 1k words was a pain. I used to give myself the arduous task of either writing so many thousand words or so many hours of work. The problem with it is, there is no challenge in it. As you just need to keep writing. An stm one day suggested to try x words in an hour. I did a similar 2.5k post in 40% less time, and best of all it was not that painful. From time to time I look at the number of words I am writing, and the time left. The current number is quite challenging. But I don't think I have reached the state of complete flow.

Writing is still a chore. Time does not fly like a rocket, but nevertheless as I said before it is not that painful. It's hard to write, come up with content. Writing gen is not hard. Writing proper content is the king.

Here the feedback is the words/per hour which I measuer every 15 mins. Also towards the end I keep looking at the word count to finish in time. I sometimes feel bored. Because just writing words seems to not cut it. Interesting insights are great rewards when you are writing. It shows that besides, writing is actually useful (feedback), they don't happen that often though. It's a tough game. So with my current goal it is actually not completely boring, but needto be better. My friend STM writes I think for 2 hrs 3 hrs...

I can't imagine writing for 3 hrs. I fucking cant. Its still a chore. 2 hrs is fine. Can be done. How do I improve my motivation towarsd writing, how to increase flow in writing. How to increase feedback while writing, how to decrease delay in reward while writing? (closure). How to write for the sake of writing?

If it is boring, then the challenge and skill are not balanced.

Rewards and feedback with writing would be solving problems, new insights, writing faster (words per hour), writing with less spelling mistakes, writing clear sentences instead of randomly vomitting everything on the paper (not sure), getting closure of writing an article. Having new new content to write.

We need immediate feedback. I can get immediate feedback by looking at words per minute written, which is what I implicitly do. I am not sure how to improve feedback with respect to gaining new insights. Writing such that I don't vomit on paper, makes me stick too much inside my head, and I fear impedes my output, becuase I try to solve things in my head and not on paper.

Trying to look at challenge, Yes I can try to do more words in an hour. If it is boring you can do better, if it is not you can do less. Maybe I should seriously look at that. Have a proper timer and a word counter. Re-writing could also be part of this. why not! Keep writing the ideas will come? Quantity first, quality next? Push to 1.5k next time. so 1.5k words per hour of writing, and 1.1k words of rewriting. See what happens. Note observations. We are playing a game of science here.

For sure the game has improved drastically once an STM suggested to play it with word count. But are there other things that I can improve on? Like in the game of basketball, I can practice to play better, I can practice certain moves to fuck with my opponents. Maybe there is something I can practice out of the court. While I was writing this sentence, I find that I made 2 spelling mistakes and it immediately highlights it in red, feedback yes but negative feedback. Impedes flow. I remember an STM telling me long back about improving my speed using this online thing, which helps you increase your output with less mistakes.

suspicion: many errors in spelling impeding the flow of writing.

It's certainly causing distractions and a lot of backspaces. I make at-least one mistake per sentence. If every sentence is 10 words on average and if every sentence has 1 mistake. I write a thousand words which means about 100 mistakes. I have to edit those 100 words and write them again, which is another 100 words. A 10% increase in time of writing alone is roughly expected. This does not involve the time for thinking. I have been writing for so long and yet I still continue to make mistakes in simple things like 'and'. So to improve skill level of not making mistakes and possibly increasing productivity I shall try and use type racer everyday for 5 mins, included in the time of work. Or I could just turn off the red, if I think it is so distracting. Every word is right.

Moving on let me write for a while and see how things go. To improve skill level, I am going to reduce mistakes so that I don't spend time on it. I don't seem to be stopping making corrections as and when I make a mistake. 'And', and other small words are corrected right there and then. HAHA and I see that I don't see some spelling errors, But I do see others.

How does an STM write so much and continue writing without deadlines. How is it not an obligation for him. Where is his motivation. Am writing to solve problems. But  am I solving any? There is no format the whole thing is hapazard. A pain for post-production. How can I better organize my writing?

If I had an exam, I never calculate how much time I have spent to read for it. Fuck, it is every fucking minute I have. Thats the problem, this game is too stupid and it is too simple. Then increase the number of words. If it is giving you anxiety, then reduce the number of words.



Writing 1k words is hard, of course I can blabber some shit. But sometimes I want to gather my senses around what I am trying to write. Aimlessly writing so many words, I am afraid doesn't get me far. These are all words. I am not sure we understand what this whole thing even entitles.

How about getting regular closure, by posting everyday. It's a herculian task to write and re-write the very same day, to the quality of publishing.

#### Writing

How do I continue to write. I remember days when I am so bored to write. 2 hrs how do I get done with that shit. The problem is it is not challenging. More challenging by making it like words per hour.

Writing gen words is not challenging or boring.

Friday is quite a pain. I struggle and procrastinate like hell. I want to finish the essay, but I take till early morning to write. I don't feel motivated enough to write as compared to watching youtube, even on the last day.

Problems

1) gigantic task ahead. Reducing 4k words to 2.5k but with several rewritings.

This is gonna take a while. #delay

More than 2 hrs of work on a friday, when I am tired and have no idea when this is going to finish.

How about including thursday in the process of cleaning up and rewriting. Ok. But I still suspect to have lot of delay, mainly because I don't know how lng it will take. I think it will take 3 to 4 hrs to reduce the stuff and make it comprehensible jibber jabber. I suggest we try it this week.

That way we know it takes so much time only.

2) not challenging to read through the whole thing and get it sorted, in no time what so ever.
boring and painful.

To make it challenging, I seriously should come up with parts, say 1.5 k each and edit it in one hr.

What about having to deal with rearranging. Not a problem. The goal is to edit the next 1k words, We can rearrange it and do what ever we want. We can try a free half an hour where I can do

It appears that I need to rewrite, and then re-arrange and then re-edit. every 1.5k 1 hr for re-writing and once that is done, re-arrange and re-edit after that can take its time, this week.


3) Reward or feedback comes the next day morning when I treat the fuck out of me with maggi and bhelpuri etc. but none other than closure the very same day.

How about a treat?

suprising insights!

How to write more,

So right now we see that it is still an obligation. How about we remove this whole obligation thing. Write if you want, write if you need to. But I have seen this in the past. I will do nothing during the weekdays, and then cram up all the work on friday and submit some subpar shit. I can easily find excuses to sleep and do other things in the name of being important. So if I need to constantly come up with content then I need these 2 hrs. I suspect feedback will only be this much say from words and ideas you get. i.e., the every right step you take in the right direction. but then I need to really step it up in the form of challenges. I am fucking bored. I don't have anything to write, so I am just dragging along. What I want to try to do is to make sure I write 1k words of re-edited content or 1.5 k words of unedited content. or I could take what I have and make it into a para of so many words with clear points, same as re-editing, wait but of final quality. I think 800 words should suffice for now.

It is important to write, create content, quantity followed by quality. We write to get new ideas that will lead to greater impact.


#### How to feel motivated to donate more.
Yes I understand that taking a vacation is not that important, if the alternative is to allow a person to die. And yet I don't feel motivated. I always think that I can maybe have the best of both worlds. You know, be an EA as well as hang out with friends and play  ball and drink. Everything costs money, in the non-EA activity region. Motivation is very important for impact. How do I feel motivated toards donating more and saving more and being more stingy in life. What is the immediate feedback you get for donating? Nothing. Everytime you donate, you should do something in parallel that actually captures the feeling of happiness of donating. Everytime you give food to a homeless person, you immediately follow it up with an actual donation. or the other way around. You wont see people immediately doing well if you just donate.

I can't see it as an action of flow though. It is more the simple motivation equation that needs to be used here. Instead attain flow in all other activities leading to it. Such as writing, work etc...

Reward is high, ok.
artificial reward of a chocolote or something that you like.

But there is crazy delay and feelings are almost null when you give.

Challenging! well, yes it is hard thing to come up with ideas to make money to begin with. This then translates to donating.

I dont know what to make of the three points in this case.

I guess I can offere myself a nice treat, every time I donte to tell the body what is important.

#### The puzzle of motivation
Solving a simple problem fast by giving rewards works better than solving a simple problem without rewards. Solving a hard problem with rewards does not work better than solving a hard  problem without rewards

The idea of having flow while working on problems is not a new one. Its about keeping yourself on your toes, It quite challenging, by that I guess we only mean that we use all the 108 bits of your info.


#### how to stay motivated regarding saving lives
When literally everything arround you and everyone around you doens't give 2 shits!


Write points as fast as I can.... Just generate content. and then work on editing all with similar goals of 100 words an hour. Any surpirise I enjoyed today?

Loosing motivation to write at the end of the day, Want to sleep!

#### speedometer
For the first time today, I had a working speedometer with my bike. Spent some time setting up but I suspect it is worth it. Only time will tell. Atleast the first 5 mins I had never felt like that before. of course it could be a novelty thing. But I don't think today was boring. But let us see how it goes tomorrow. I am afraid the thing that I check to measure it with is a very fragile idea. I should  instead measure things like, does it still feel like an obligation. Are you bored during that time, do you think about anything else? What is your only thought, your only focus, your life at that moment. I think it was a check check and check. Cardio baby. Is is an obligation? Well last monday it was. Tomorrow I want to see what I can do, how much better I can be? how full cna I keep my time during cycling. I have my immediate feedback, and my ulterior goal is met. Stay healthy as scooby says. Next I would slowly like to cut out on the extra stuff I eat, like the mini samosas and stuff, but lets see.


#### Working out
Today I think I had the best press workout yet. Every workout for me, I have fabourite excercises. Like for the push workout it is by far the press. For the leg workout it is by far the squats. Why?

I suspect this all has to do with motivation. The thing that I think of and look forward to is squats and press. I am literally just doing things during calf raises and barbell rows etc...

Immediate feedback, shows in the results. Last week I could do 6 kg of flys, but I it was not too easy not too tough. I had the idea of using 8kg for as many reps as I can. I got to fucking 6 reps, something I couldn't image last week. Feedback. Challenge was up the whole workout today. Right from press to flys. If you are doing a weight that takes 12 reps and you find it boring and you find your peace in the last reps where you push your self, then start with a heavier weight, do less reps. Then you don't feel the continuous burn, so once you are done with the higher weights for  afew reps shift. This way the challenge level stayed tight, for me to keep up with. I am seeing improvement from last time. I am able to do more. The pump because of that and because of the challenge is killer.
