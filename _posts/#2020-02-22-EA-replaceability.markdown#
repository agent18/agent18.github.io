## EAs are not replaceable

Also some statements about
	value... https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#but-wont-i-be-replaceable



Back in June 2019

According to this article, you are not replaceable.

Main argument being if you take a job the other person is freed to do
other things. But I am not sure this is true as we look at people like
EA applicant and others going to do sub optmial things?

Oh man this is going to be a long article too.

## 80khours

https://80000hours.org/2019/08/how-replaceable-are-top-candidates-in-large-hiring-rounds/

Basically, you are replaceable or not aka your value goes up or not,
IF the variance among TOP CANDIDATES IS HIGH, the more people apply
for a position the less replaceable you are....

80k's argument in the past (surprise surprise) that

Like how are they wrong about everything? or did the times change?

And regarding the WHEN statement atleast Peter hurford for his jobs
and EAF hiring round and Open phil seem to be thinking otherwise.

## Value created by one person

In [this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC) Peter and AGB start the discussion on Replaceability
in Oct 2018. 

If A who works for EAO1 is able to generate value of
500k<span>$</span> and B is able to generate 400k at EAO1 what is the
value for the world?

It is 900k if B finds something for his similar in another EAO. It is
500k if B is not able to get a job considering the opportunity
cost. Also it is 500k if B takes the job and A ETGs 100k.

So if A has the option to ETG 100k and B takes EAO1, or if A takes the
EAO1 job it is the exact same value to the world.

But if A has the option to ETG 150k and B takes EAO1, this is
definitely better than A working at EAO and B becoming jobless.

More realistically...

Let's say A can create 500k units of value and B can create 400k units of
value at EAO1 if they get a job. A would like to compare if he should
work for EAO1 or ETG. 

**Case 1:** A can ETG 150k and B can 

**Claims**: The value of taking up a job at an EAO is equal to the
difference in value with the last potential applicant.

**Example**: A can produce 500k and B can produce 400k at an EAO. 

Total value if A takes the job and B does nothing is 500k

Total value if B takes the job and A does nothing is 400k

Total value if B takes the job and A does work for 100k in ETG, is
500k. 

So it appears that if I can instead ETG 150k then I should give up the
job at EAO, even if I am producing a value of 500k. Wow.

**Claims**: If A is better than B and B can get any job anywhere, A
should take up the job. 

A can produce 500k and B can produce 400k at an EAO. 

Total value if A takes the job and B does nothing is 500k

Total value if A takes that job and B works for 50k is 550k.

Total value if A takes that job and B works for 10k is 510k.
|        | 500k     | 400k     |          |          |             |

**Claims**: It looks like I should take up EAO, if I will be the best
in it. Well... No it seems to depend on what each can ETG.

**Claims**: let's see what if A and B produce no difference @ EAO.

|   | 402k     | 400k     |          |          |             |
|   | A at EAO | B at EAO | A at ETG | B at ETG | total value |
|---|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | 402      | 0        | 0        | 50k      | 452k        |
| 2 | 0        | 400      | 50k      |          | 450k        |
|   |          |          |          |          |             |

If there are many B's then is it even worth me struggling to be as
good as B? to only end up with 2k extra?

With two similar guys, its pointless to fight to be at the top....

The value you add to an EAO is very much dependent on the how
replaceable you are.

It deosn't seem worth it 
	


If B can do anything else, 
 




What is the value for the world?

What is the value you add to the org?

What is the value for the org in taking you over the next best applicant?

An org potentially wants to create as much value as possible, so 

## Why is Replaceability important?

Getting a job in the top EAO is not easy. It is competitive to say the
least as 100's of good resumes are fighting for a chance. So is it
still worth it? when is it still worth it? What can we infer from the
evidence we have. 

**It is important to know if you are replaceable or not. Why?**

Consider A and B applying for a job at an EAO. The top members at the
EAO are able to evaluate A can contribute 500k if he takes up the job
and B can contribute 400k if he takes up the job. For simplicity,
let's assume they produce little or no value if A or B does not take
take up that job.

Total value created if A sits idle at home: 400k
Total value created if A takes the job: 500k. 

So if A works 500k otherwise the world already has 400k. So it appears
that if A put effort he made the world 100k better that is it NOT 500k
better. 

Now imagine the scenario that B didn't exist, i.e., the job is not
replaceable or that the last applicant for the job is miles below
A. Then:

Total value created if A sits idle at home: 0k
Total value created if A takes the job: 500k

In other words A is a fucking blessing to the EAO based on if he is
replaceable or not.

If you are replaceable then you might as well sit on your ass. If not
then you better be running a marathon.

What if ABCD are apping for the same job, what is the value you
create?

A --> 500k; B--> 400k; C--> 300k; D--> 200k at the job. If A takes teh
job 100k value.

Lot of high quality pool in open phil AGB and EAF and Open
Phil... Whta does this mean?

## So are you replaceable

**You are not replaceable**

Absolutely. But 80khours seems to suggest that one is not replaceable,
because organizations are TC.

https://80000hours.org/2015/07/replaceability-isnt-as-important-as-you-might-think-or-weve-suggested/

https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#but-wont-i-be-replaceable


Is the  assumption that you are replaceable right?

**You are fucking replaceable**

Competitiveness, how many people apply to the job? not relevant. Even
if there are only 2 people applying (most), the second one informs how
replaceable the hired person is. But if he gets the job like 80khours
says then A absorbs the full but unlikely that is so.

We are interested in Value. Looking at that 100 people applied or 17
people were in the final interview, it appears that 

There are very few jobs only the top of the top get jobs so it 



In this section I think we should look at competitiveness and
resulting impact. that is it. In the following section we should see 

I think this is something very important, that converts that
competitiveness of something into whether there is a point working on
something or not. 

Start with 80khours claiming replaceability is bullshit adn then put
forth arguments and also quote rob wambuliamman

It's too competitive and I despise 80khours for selling me bullshit.



Orgs are hiring slow, they remain small, only 50 jobs are out so most
likely replaceable.

So am wondering what in the hell 80khours is talking about, as the
only 2 hiring rounds details I see, seem to be saying it is not hard
to find GRs... AT ALL.

Level 1 and Level 0 assumptions which is true? LEvel 1 says you are
replaceable and wont get a job in EAOs at that high expected value. 

Level 0 says that you will and everybody will get a job easilly.

## So Are you replaceable

Let's take the hiring round of Open Phil, 

I think we need details on the value contributed to decide if we
should work our asses off or not. 

But we can get values, in terms of money moved or donations
influenced. 

How much value a new hire creates? and how much better is the last
applicant as compared to the one you hired?

10% and 500k, then if I take up ETG for 50k I match it.

This is ridiculous and can be achieved with a DS job I think and it
has other advantages like I can stay in touch with other things

But what can we infer from his statement

Atleast for a GR role we got to be 20% better than the top most guy to
make an impact of 10%. and if I am 50% better I can make a larger
contribution.

## Brain fart about replaceability.

The key things appear to be how much value more you can add than your
next in line hire, and what is the actual value. This seems to give me
a value of how much is going to be my impact typically as seen in
indrews. 

How much impact does the top GR have?

So looking at the impact can be done by looking at the money moved,
associated value for a GR in co-founder numbers and multilying it with
replaceability. That will be your impact.

This will give a picture to everybody about what sort of impact they
have as a GR. So TC means 100% value absorbtion, but that is not the
case.

Should I check other profiles? or just move on to why I wont get a job
at an EA?

And maybe working in AI... If it is that competitive, I don't hope to
have as much as impact as them but even if you are as good as them? is
that enough? that is the question you want answered. 

So 10% x 500k will allow us to decide the impact for the effort we
put. If the impact is 2k then we can go to .. I can't come up with
this 10% value but can come up with 500k value. 10% vlue I can ask
Open Phil. And so if I am as good as those people how much can I hope
to contribute?

Is it better to ETG at 50k?


What do I want to ask Luke?

What is the value of your your junior hires... Do you have an estimate
like this?

How much more value did last hire have compared to the best one you
didn't hire?

And did he get a job in EA?

Ask EAF (AI strategy) Done

Ask Open Phil GR Done 

Ask Peter Hurford on Researcher Done

Ask TLYCS on researchers 

Ask GiveWell on researchers

As FHI Carrick for operations people

Ask Aaron gelter

Ask Miri boy for info

Julia Wise 

## What to ask

Hi,

Thank You for your work. In order to estimate the impact of working at
your organization, I ask the following 2 questions:

1. What is the value of a ______ (in expected dollars moved)

## What to ask Luke

Respected Sir (Luke Muelhauser),

Thank You for the wonderful post on the last hiring round for 5 GR's
in 2018. I have two questions for you. I would be deeply indebted if
you answer:

1. What is the value of the most recent GR hired in dollars influenced
   per year (without accounting for replaceability)?
   
2. How much more value in % do you think (guess, estimation, gut feel)
   the recent hire provides compared to the second best and third best
   applicant (who just didn't get the job)?
   
Thank You very much. 

Regards,
Thej Kiran Ravichandran

## What to ask EAF

Hi Stefan,

Thank You for the wonderful post on the last hiring round as reported in EA Forum . I have two questions for you. I would be deeply indebted if you answer:

1. What is the value of the most recent Research Analyst hired in dollars influenced per year (without accounting for replaceability)?
2. How much more value in % do you think (guess, estimation, gut feel) the recently hired research analyst provides compared to the second best and third best applicant (who just didn't get the job)?

Thank You very much for your time and consideration.

P.S

I have also tried to reach you by mail.

## What to ask Peter_Hurford

Hi Peter,

Big Fan. Heartfelt thank you for the enlightenment you have provided
through EA forum and, giving crucial data to people like me regarding
[Replaceability and Talent Constrained EA](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC#ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC).

1. What is the value of the most recent Research Analyst hired in
   dollars influenced per year (without accounting for
   replaceability)?
   
2. How much more value in % do you think (guess, estimation, gut feel)
   the recently hired research analyst provides compared to the second
   best and third best applicant (who just didn't get the job)?


## Waht to ask TLYCS
Hi Jon,
Thank you for your input at the EA forum on the lack of Talent constrain. I found your contribution to be very useful to gauge the "truth" on this discussion. I have two quick questions on this:
1. What is the value of the most recent Research Analyst equivalent hired in
   donations and grants ($) influenced per year (without accounting for
   replaceability)?
   
2. How much more value in % do you think (guess, estimation, gut feel)
   the recently hired research analyst equivalent provides compared to the second
   best and third best applicant (who just didn't get the job)?
Thank You very much. Very much appreciate the response and your work for the community.

## What to ask Carrick Flynn (FHI)

Hi Carrick,
Thank You for your post on EA forum regarding AI Strategy and Policy bottleneck.In an attempt to gauge the value of a replaceable AI strategy and policy researcher, can you please answer these 2 quick questions?

1. What is the value of the most recent Researcher @ FHI (in Strategy and Policy but not in Disentanglement Research) hired in dollars influenced per year (without accounting for
   replaceability) or any other way you measure impact ($)?
   
2. How much more value in % do you think (guess, estimation, gut feel)
   the recently hired researcher provides compared to the second
   best and third best applicant (who just didn't get the job)?

Thank You very much for your time and work done for the community.
P.SWe are expecting eagerly an update on the Bottleneck article you
wrote a few years ago. :)


## what to ask Ben from CEA

## reply to ben

Hi Ben,

Thank You for that link I am checking it out.

> What are you collecting this information for?

I am currently evaluating what options I might be suited for to create
max impact. As 80khours says GR and AI people are in "crazy need"
through their surveys and all of their many blog posts, I was leaning
towards those options.

But recently I found out that EA orgs might not be as Talent
constrained (TC) as 80khours made them out to be. For example GR in
Open Phil (recommended career path), has 100s of "strong applicants"
and OP implied that they are process/management/other constrained but
not TC. Similar story with EAF, Rethink Priorities and TLYCS. 

Replaceability has become crucial now in this light and 80khours turns
out to be not that useful or trust worthy ( with false claims on TC,
replaceability, focusing too much on career capital, how hard it is to
get an EA job). Thus, I am trying to do my own evaluation. Hence I
seek values for replaceability (question 2) and dollars influenced or
moved at EA orgs by the employees (question 1) to multiply\* and
compare it with ETG and if it makes sense to go behind ETG instead of
EA job.

P.S
I am writing a post about it. Hope to make this my first post on EA
forum hopefully by this weekend.

\* Replaceability % \* Value moved in $ \* % contribution that belongs
to the employee (as opposed to the donor) 

## Why I think level 1 assumptions hold and not level 0
