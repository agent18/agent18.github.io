#### Career Quiz: recommended list of careers

The career quiz with the selected options result in the following
career choices: 

1) Could you become good at math, science or logic?
Yes (outperform 80% of graduates)

2) Could you become good at writing and speaking? 
Yes (Outperforming 80% of graduates in a humanities subject)

3) Are you happy betting on a small chance of a big impact?
No

4) Are you happy trying to work in the most demanding fields?
Yes

Challenging and long hours should not be a problem I suppose. I have
seen evidences of this in my past, with my master thesis(10-14 hrs a
day, programming, reading), with my work in IIT Madras (easily clocked
10 hrs or more a day for 1 year atleast), Courses in my masters
etc... and for a while I would work 8 hrs a day and come back home and
spend 2 hrs a day writing and researching etc... 

5) How far through your career are you?

Early (27) finished masters and working for ~2 years

6) How do you want to contribute? 

All possible ways: Direct, indirect, earning to give, research etc...

And the out put is:

- Policy oriented Civil services
- Economics PhD
- Data Science (skill building and earning to give)
- Working at effective non-profites
- Machine learning PhD
- Software engineering (skill building and earning to give)
- Trading in quantitative hedge funds

When we are ready to bet on small chances then:

- Congressional staffer
- Policy oriented Civil services
- Machine learning PhD
- Working at effective Altruist organizations
- Founding effective non-profits
- Data science
- Party politics
