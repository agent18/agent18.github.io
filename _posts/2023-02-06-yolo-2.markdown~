## The Constraint is in your head

In earlier posts we saw that constraints make our decision making
easy. When my ~~purpose~~ constraint was to save as many lives as
possible, it was very easy for me to decide what to do. Go to the US?
Hell's yeah. 

Unfortunately, I don't have those constraints no more. Now that I am
constraint less, what do I do? In the [last essay](/constriaint-in-head-2.html), we realized
that we cannot blindly accept constraints, nor can we randomly take
constraints like "having a baby" just because four billion other
people are doing it. 

During all this we are the ones judging if a constraint is ok or
not. The constrain is seemingly in our own heads.

Not only this, the constraint in our head has a tendency to change
with time, are sometimes hard to apply and get meaningful results, and
we can even discover new ones (ones that we currently don't know
about).

## Designing constraints to have a "great life"

Remember, the constraint judge is in your head. 

The basics are that I want to be happy, I don't want to be miserable
and I want to be excited about the future. Constraint Judge In my Head
approved. 

But what does it mean?

How does it help me make a decision on if I should stay in the
Netherlands or go to the US?

I don't have any more constraints but I can discover them. 

Recently I was watching a tamil serial, where they thought the
~~purpose~~ constraint of their life was "to live gauruvama" (you have
to live so that people from your caste respect you), otherwise it was
not worth living. So do as your cast members would do. Lite I'll pass.

My parents think the constraint of my life that will be most useful is
to get married and have children. All this despite hearing at that
very same moment how problematic my bros life was (with dealing with
his wife and a kid). Lite I'll pass.

An STM suggested to think of YOLO. Hmm. Yes you live only once.
