#### **A few months back at the RSI Anonymous**
Hi I am an Agent and **I used to suffer** from RSI. (Hear Here!) And this is my story...

----

#### **Abbreviations**
    KP - Knee Pain
    BP - Back Pain
    RSI - Repetitive Stress Injury

I use quotations throughout the essay to inform the reader that in hindsight, I believe I was just misinterpretting things.

----

#### **The Synopsis**

Around 3-4 years back I had my first encounter with RSI aka Repetitive Stress Injury. It was "_natural_" then, for me to conclude the "_obvious_" that I was clicking the mouse like a Bitch and hence I got RSI. Along with this, overworking like crazy, sitting in "bad chairs" and riding bikes for long distances, I "_figured_" that I have back pain as a result. During this time I also had small encounters with knee pain. Of course, all around me there were people sitting in various weird postures and not giving a fuck. I used to think, man, one day he's going to face the music.

![bargy_pic]

I was like a boy who didn't give two shits about posture and the like, until he realized he was growing old (pain being a sign of old-age). The scary part being that this was going to be part of my life from now on. Following these issues, I switched to using only the keyboard (ergonomic where possible)(for my RSI), used ergonomic postures only (for my BP) and didn't use the stairs much (for my KP). It worked I guess, in keeping the pain off, but this is boring. I wanted to do more, in life and workout hard and would need to improve the then current state of my health much much more. Around 10 months back, I figured I would have a job that could only involve clicking the mouse, and panicked. I revisited my friends blog on how [he cured his RSI][stm].

The cure was extremely simple and cost me $0. I read a lot of material online via the [friends post][stm], testimonials from people who cured their life off of RSI **and that was it**. The cure had begun, then some very small tricks to keep myself in track.

Long story short, within the very same week I started reading about rsi, I got cured of it. By cured I mean like fuck I-don't-give-a-shit-no-more-about-RSI cured. I have grown to the level of I-don't-give-a-fuck-pretty-much-about-posture with regard to BP. This later 'level' took more like a few months to stabilize. I happily workout and am never scared of looking at a chair without back rest. I run once in 3-4 days, for about 20 mins with gradual buildups and 1 min breaks every 3-5 mins. All the credit goes to the theory, the testimonials and friends who helped me in this journey.

Hear Here! And this is my long journey of 3-4 years.

#### **About me**
![](/images/rsi/kids.jpg)
I was quite an active kit in my young age. Played a lot of sports. Now I am a mechanical engineer, 26 years old, who works with FEM and CAD a lot, i.e., clicking like a bitch. Majority of my work is to sit in front of a computer. I am an atheist, non-believer of astrology and the like, opposed to "alternative" medicine and so on. I say this to inform you that it takes much more than the quintessential bullshit to persuade me to try out something - to say the least, not fully scientific. I am not trying to say I am the rationalest fuck you will ever come across, I suck, NO CONTEST (more on this later).

The cure for RSI, BP and the like proposed by [Dr. John Saruno][Saruno_wiki], is contrary to conventional wisdom. Sounds in the beginning like those fake miracle cures, where they instantly [make your leg grow back][leg_ext] or cure you of your cancer. But however, this miracle is different. There is a lot of evidence and things that go for it. The first being this theory was proposed by [Dr. John Saruno][Saruno_wiki], who is an actual doctor. [Harvard][harvard] made a small study with its students. The transformation claims in the [news video][youtube_BP] are phenomenal. People have gone from hardly walking to running. The [thank-you-testimonials][thankyou] which contains so many people thanking Saruno for giving them back their lives and finally the '[reviews of his book on amazon][amazon]'. My very good friend [an STM] also had this issue, and cured himself using Dr. Sarunos ideas, although he didn't have to buy or read the book. He is one of the primary reasons I had started off on this journey. I don't think I ever thanked him.

I urge you all to take the time and go through the above links (atleast) and my journey and be cured, if the pain was just in your head. Hope it helps.

#### **Pain begins**

I just finished my bachelors, which means I was about 22 years old (2012). I joined in a research institute to work. It involved CAD and FEM. It slowly went on to working late in the evening and clicking the mouse more and more. Thats when I had my first experience with RSI. It got pretty bad, and I started taking advice from my prof who has carpel tunnel regarding exercises and so on. I used to switch to the left hand and have shortcut commands to ease work. I think my friend informed me that writing on the keyboard is much less painfull than using the mouse and I took to it. _I believed it_. I got an ergonomic keyboard and mouse to save my hand from more damage. This particular mouse I absolutely didn't use as it was so uncomfortable and slowing me down.

![mouse_pic]

I used to travel on the bike for about 18 km a day atleast. Plus I was sitting for long hrs without eating properly. "_Naturally_" I assumed these were the reasons I found myself with BP. Welcome!

I used to climb the stairs of 2 floors quite often at work. "_Naturally_" I assumed this was the reason I found myself with KP. Welcome!

Towards the end of my tenure at the research institute, i.e., @ 24 years old, I was pretty OK. Occasional bouts with back pain. But I was playing tennis and all, about an hr a day for around 7-9 months already. I also did a fucking road trip on a car which involved traveling about 18 hrs I think, one way. Fuck yeah! I was atleast fine.


#### **Pain rises**

In about three months I was on my way to Netherlands for my masters (Aug, 2014) and quit my job. I wanted to bulk the fuck up. I started working out, and was too retarded and stupid to start with the beginners work out, started pumping huge amounts (20 kg bench press for my level) of iron at the gym. One day, when I was doing lunges or squats I think I pulled my back. From then on things went downhill.

Three months straight I was almost bedridden. Everything caused BP but not of unbearable levels. **I panicked**. The very sight of BP is bad right? I had BP all the fucking time. Some of the worst days of my life. Anything I did, caused backpain to the point that it didn't make sense. The place where I had pain kept changing, it was not consistent, but throughout my back. I went to atleast 3 doctors and multiple times. MRI and Xray were all fine. Everyone suggested some exercise and some pain killers. Can't remember anything working or seeing any progress. _One day I am doing what ever the fuck I want and in within a few days my life is in destination:fucked_. Nothing ended up not giving BP. Sitting with backrest, lying down, traveling in a car or bus, sitting without backrest, sitting on plastic chairs at home, sleeping on the mattress at home (which had some bumps "and so", some positions seemed to work and some not). Feeling bored just lying down and also becoming fat (hidden obese), I tried swimming, getting back to tennis. Nothing seemed to be without BP, and so I quit them. Somehow, I just ended up lying down all the time and as much as I could. You know resting and shit.

If I went to my friends place, lied down there as well. They cracked jokes at me big time for doing that. Where ever I went I lied down. It was extremely hard to sit for one hr even I guess. I remember going to meet my brothers in laws before marriage, and I was stuck in this shitty chair and couldn't rest my back at all. Very uncomfortable times. Friends came to visit me at home as I was leaving to Netherlands for my masters, even at that time, I stayed predominantly lying down and speaking to them. At one point I was so desparate to pay this dickhead who looked at me for less than a minute and said I have chronic BP and that he will cure me. He asked for 20k rs. It was obvious he was trying to squeeze money out of me, but I was desparate. For some reason I didn't follow it up with him.

I did move around, even moved from city to city during these 3 months, but it was very uncomfortable. During this time I also managed to do a 6 hr trip to home in car with my family, with one hr breaks to twist my back.

To add to all this, I had a totally unconnected surgery (pilunoidal sinus) which screwed my ability to sit even more for a while.

#### **Pain mildens but wait**

At the end of those three months, I took a flight to Netherlands, about 13 hrs. I never imagined my flight to Netherlands would be so free of pain. I am probably biased or having some major inaccuracies in my story, but as far as I remember, I had no/very little pain. Very peaceful, just taking care of healing my wound due to that unconnected surgery I was talking about earlier. It just didn't't add up. Just _one day before, I am lying down most of the time, and then suddenly riding a plane without much issues!_ WHaaaaaaaaT! ALMOST AS IF SUDDENLY I was doing things that previously I hadn't imagined I'd do.

Once I came to Netherlands, I think I found the chair that "works" for my back, the mattress at my new house already was good enough! Hmmm! Interesting ;). I was worried about getting a cycle, and guess what, no problems there either, the cycle I test-tried worked for my back! Whaaaaaaat (high-pitched this time)! What are the odds!

I was not completely free of pain. BP was the main issue in my life at this time as I pretty much stuck to the keyboard and typing. I went the ergonomic way, managing posture and the placement of screens and so on. Got in touch with a phisio and was reporting to her the whole issue. I would have to tell her my entire story every time and she would somehow "grasp"(yeah right!) what my issue has been holistically! Anyways, she suggested I do some work out. I liked the idea as I was also being hidden-obese during that time, with a big belly.

Started going to the gym and after a while with the beginners workout and little pain or reduced pain. I moved to the intermediate workout. I took care of things to a great level, making sure my trainer checks my posture and gives me numbers to set on the machine to adjust height. Despite this things didn't appear to look good. I guess I didn't recover afterall. Either I did more weight than my body can handle, or screwed up with posture. Shocked I ran to the phisio and she suggested I improve my core and suggested group exercises such as core stability.

Core stability was awesome. I was completely exhausted at the end of the workout. I was doing core stability, climbing and spinning once a week. Things were slow and alright and I think I was still fat and bored when I decided to take a run and straight away did one for 1 full hr, about 8-10k. Thats about the time I think knee pain became a major issue. Couldn't continue core stability any more, or for that matter spinning as well I think. KP started to intensify with core-stability.

Exams happened, for about 1-2 months straight. I didn't do any workout, just went to the library, found my particular chair and worked on my computer for long hrs. Was totally fine for those months.

Went back home in july 2015, after a year of coming to Netherlands, and had a peaceful time in India. Much better than the time I left to Netherlands, when I used to lye down all the time.

After I came back started working out with extremely small weights. Just decided to go the scooby way, i.e., few exercises and the beginner type. Pushup, pullup, legpress, leg curl and leg extension and a couple of core exercises. Here I was going to make absolutely sure that I was doing the lowest of weights, so that I don't stress my body. I did 5 kg on leg press and the absolute lowest on the others. Quite challenging to do this when people watch you as though you don't got no muscle. I toughed it out, with the hope that I will someday be killing it. I pushed to about 20 kg, noted down when all I get pain and where all I get pain and studied my pain as I pushed my self in a small way every time I went to the gym. Life was chill regarding working out. Push ups and pull ups(assisted) didn't do anything to me. But I was keeping track and pushing myself majorly with increasing the reps to feel pumped and motivated about the workout. One fine day I came to the point of leg pressing 20 kg, without significant pain in the legs or back. I did this slowly, 8 reps after building up from 10 and 15 kgs in the first two sets. Leg extension, don't even ask, it was pathetic. The growth was slow, but I thought there was improvement and some day, I am going to be conquering the sun right? and patience is a virtue.

To counter KP, I tried to do a jog with proper stretching. On the advice of my Phisio, I started with 12 mins jog. I would jog very slowly for 2 mins and then rest for 1 min and constantly check and think if I have pain or not. Needless to say, I couldn't continue with that. It gave me pain!

#### **The final motivation**

My life recipe was I used atleast an external or ergonomic keyboard, stuck to ergonomic postures, didn't climb the stairs, did low weights in the gym and life was going to be alright. Pain was in control but working out with low weights was boring, when I had to move to Munich for a period of seven months. I already got used to the way to working in Netherlands. I knew my chairs, the ones that would work, at my department, at the library and most importantly at home. I knew my gym, and all the amenities around, that would support my body. Having moved to another city, I needed to figure this out all over again.

In the new city I made sure the table at work was at the right height, the chair was alright, and the screen was positioned as well. I was obsessed over this, as this could "_potentially fuck me_". I managed to find something that would work for me in the library. I typically look at a seating arrangement and decide if it is right for my back and then go ahead and test it. I am right most of the time (No surprise there!). I had to travel about 2 hrs a day on train and figured I could use my laptop during that time to type. But you know how laptop keyboards are #unergonomic. I faintly remember pain in my hands as a result of typing on a laptop. What was I going to do? Everything involved the fingers, even reading a paper article was going to be a problem as I would have to hold it with my fingers for 2 hrs a day. Time was of the essence. How was I going to cope with this loss of time?

Simultaneously, I reached a point where I had to decide what my career was going to be in. I could not come to terms with the work available. It had to be either CAD(designer) or be a FEM engineer. Both of which required quite a lot of clicking.

#### **The Cure**

Afraid and panicky I went back to the post by my friend. Read it, also read related articles thoroughly. One thing that was apparent to me was that the [book][amazon] could cure. I looked online, it was pricy for my budget or the cheaper version took very long to arrive. I checked with my friend and he amended his post.

![](/images/rsi/miracles.jpg)

> I have not bought the book by John Saruno. The above articles were enough to do the job for me.

I followed suit. I believed him. I read articles after articles, teared up at the life changes this brought to peoples lives. Every post or review was a heart wrenching story where in the end the protogonist WON. He WON! He got CURED!

That was it. That was the cure. Internalization of the idea that the pain is in my head, was happening. I am not sure about the exact time frame but it was less than 3-5 days (I checked) from the time I started reading these articles, when I had a massive mouse clicking task. I took on to making a powerpoint for the whole day or so, where I clicked like a Bitch. And the pain you ask! Well lets just say it was hardly there or I didn't care. The same weekend, I wrote like a bitch on my laptop keyboard, the whole fucking time. These tasks I dont think I would have imagined that I could do without pain. After that point, I can't really remember having RSI. Whaaaaaaat! Very rarely, I got a tingling in my hand or even pain, but all it took was looking at my hand and asking my body to "behave yourself, We have great things to accomplish and that if this pain is not real please go away...". As silly as it sounds, yes I did talk to my body and it was part of the cure. Now a days I don't even have to do that. RSI! I bid you adieu!

The theory behind this revolutionary cure is roughly as follows: You probably stress about a task. You're brain wants to free you away from it and starts by giving you the [stick][stick_ref]. You're brain doesn't want you to do the stressful task. It gives you pain. You worry about that pain, you're blood vessels constrict. This gives you more pain. You worry about that pain more and you're blood vessels constrict even more. This gives you more pain. You worry about that pain more and you're blood vessels constrict even more. This gives you more pain. You worry about that pain more and you're blood vessels constrict even more. You get the picture ;).Its a vicious cycle.

Thats great! I tried it and it worked for me. The pain seems to be in my head.

#### **The Extension**
I started reading about BP and how it might be connected to the RSI theory. Turns out my [thalaivan Saruno][Saruno_wiki], kicks ass there as well. I saw related posts. I clearly remember my plight just when I got to Munich. I had a very bad chair (one without backrest) when I first went to my Munich home. I immediately started looking for chairs. For the first few days as soon as I came home I would go to sleep or lye down almost asap as I couldn't handle doing things without a proper back rest, or so I thought. BP would creep up as I sat without backrest. I don't know how the link happened but then I found that Saruno had written a book on BP! God bless that MAN! No points for guessing that **I didn't have to read that book as well!**

I found this amazing inspiring tale of this guy. In fear that I might not find it again I quote it partially here. The amazon book link is [here][amazon_BP]. The actual review is [here][amazon_review_BP].
 >The book came. I read it. It took about 1.5 hours (it's short and written for laypeople). I decided to try it. **I went outside and ran up the steps by my house. I hadn't walked more than a few steps in months. The run hurt like hell, but it didn't make anything worse. So I committed. I went to the movies that night.** I was terrified of sitting for two hours, but every time the pain would flare up I would internally remind myself that it was because of my internal pain, rage, whatever you call it. I spent a lot of time reminding myself of this, and I doubted myself. But within 2 days, I really was able to do some things, and I started to believe. I definitely still had pain, but I worked on it. Really, really hard. And I made myself do the things I was most afraid of doing. Going to the pilates class I was sure would injure my back. Going hiking on the same trail that precipitated the whole thing. Going to spin class. And I couldn't believe I was able to do these things. I forced myself to do anything I was afraid of. I repeated the phrase "there is nothing wrong with you" probably a million times.

"Inshallah!", is what I would have said if I was not an atheist.

I followed this up with a [youtube video][youtube_BP] on my thalivan and this video is fully on BP. This video dealt into lives of people with BP all the way back in the 90's. With BP as is the disclaimer, it took time, and the cure was not instantaneous like rsi. I re-watched the video often to internalize that there is nothing wrong with me. Sometimes I lost hope, as BP crept back in. Those were the times I had to re-watch the video again for inspiration, internalization, to keep increasing my belief in the theory. I read that BP stories again. Got my goosebumps and proceeded further. Soon, I can't remember when, I slowly started giving less of a fuck about posture. I started to sit on my ass bent like a bitch. Posture! What the effing shit is that! I didn't believe I was becoming YOUNG again! The point is to internalize that there is nothing wrong with you and see if it works, to check if your body was fooling you all this time, if the pain was only in your head! Turns out it was. That lying-two-faced-son-of-a-bitch was fucking with me this whole time. Its been atleast 8 months since the miracle cure, and I continue to give less of a fuck about posture.

Remember I was talking about KP. Yes that was another of my worries too. I didn't climb the stairs for a while. I couldn't push more than 20 kg without mild pain in my legs. I couldn't run as well. What if this too is a hoax perpetrated my the lying body (to be read in the voice of trump). I remember in the first few days of coming to munich.e., even before learning about this treatment, I would run to the station, you heard me. I would run about 400 m nonstop to reach the station in about 5 mins with a 3-4 kg bag on my back, or else I would miss the train. Rarely can I remember feeling KP after such a run. It was as though my body forgot to give me pain! "Bitch I am running and you forgot?", I said to my body. Only a few months before that incident, I couldn't jog for 12 mins at a stretch, even though I would jog for 2 mins and walk for 1 minute. Pain always crept it and I panicked.

Soon enough I hit the gym optimistically. Within a few weeks, I was pumping **80 motherfuckering kgs** at the leg press machine as opposed to my max of 20 puny kgs a few months back. I was extending about 50 kgs as opposed to 7.5 kg I think. Unfucking believable for what I was capable of doing a few months back. SHACKKKKED Completely!

#### **Caution**

I do get backpain now and then, much more frequently than RSI. But I feel the trick is in not giving a shit especially for things as silly as posture. When I am exercising, I look for BP and KP the next day or the next time or even after work out. This is the indicator I use to continue or approach with caution, any activity.

Even as I write this post, I had to forgo my chair for some reasons. Sat on the bed without back rest for about 2 hrs writing on my laptop. Tingling feeling now and then but who cares. Isn't that the game anyway! However I am still wary of my back and knee, and am slowly increasing the dosage at the gym. I have started squats (eyebrow raise followed by gasps). Yay me! Even after discovering the cure, I still was scared to do squats. I tried it one day in munich (7 months back) with so much fear. Videos by [Scooby][scooby_squats] were like, if you have BP then be extra careful. At this point of time in life I was peaking, very low pain, killing it at the gym and so on. And yet, I was still afraid like hell to try out squats. Over conscious about my position I try to squat just a few times at home as practice, and I had it. Massive pain and I left it at that. But the pain is in your head right? Suck my dick!

Every now and then I stop working out due to exams or defence preparations, or job searches. I got back to the working out scene recently. Been doing twice a week. I have a job here now. Now that other tides have settled, I am slowly introducing squats. Been doing the beginners workout only, i.e.,20 min run with push-up, pull-up and squats (without weight) and core rotisserie workout. Not any pain that I know of from the next day informing me that I fucked up. I stick to 2 times a week for now. Its a fear. But its okay for now. Want to do this a while before pushing to living at gym ;).

Same with the knee, extended to it. I have been climbing the stairs to the kitchen around 5-10 times a day easily, for 5 months now. Recently I went back home for a month. My house is in the second floor. We have a lift, but I had been using the stairs only, just like the good old days, when Ich war ein jongen.

Turns out people cure a whole lot of shit that arise from similar settings of stress. People make that transformation from a naive Kamalhassan in Vishvaroopam to that protogonist we all look up to! The pain travels to various parts as the people try to make remedies for the parts in pain. Later, they know about saruno and they get cured, just like in miracles, but this one being real!

#### **Treatments**
I have tried, using ergonomic keyboards, ergonomic postures, going to doctors, physio and workrave. I am not sure of the real value they added to my life.

The doctors and phisios didn't seem to know about such a concept as 'pain only in your head'. Shocking! Ergonomic postures helped me I think, but again, it could have all be in my head. Workrave was almost impossible to use. The number of breaks you need to take, the times the computer freezes not allowing you to work is irritating. I remember using it on and off, i.e., when pain was getting serious, and sometime you get pissed off with it. Slowly building up load is something that I am personally for. The only positive thing about it is that you probably reduce the risk of injury, by not taking on more than you can handle.

#### **The odd things**

I'd like to point out those times when my body forgot to be consistent with its philosophy.

1. Right hand and left hand RSI!
I read this somewhere and I believe it was true for me as well. My right hand started paining because of RSI after say 'x' hrs of usage. So I switched after a while to my left hand. And without much usage, my left hand got rsi as well!

2. Netherlands travel
Until a day before my travel to Netherlands, I was always lying down, anything I did would give me BP. When my friends were around I would continue to lie down. The day I travel to Netherlands, its a straight 13 hr flight. I just remember taking care of the injury due to my pilunoidal sinus.

3. My ability to sit for 12 hrs atleast doing my studies, provided I got the "right chair" for 2 months straight. I hardly exercised during this time except for some twisting and bending of my body every now and then.

4. Running to the station like a mad cow
When the last thing I could do was run for "less than 12 minutes" without KP and I feared climbing the stairs, I ran straight to the station to catch a train with a laptop in my backpack. I did this on many days. Pain, Was ist das?

5. Neck pain: Even now when I was typing I got NP. But it didn't stay for long. I suddenly started becoming engrossed in writing and can't remember having the pain. Last few days at my NEW JOB, I sometimes stick my head to the computer while focusing on some details. Maybe its causing Neck RSI! Yeah not too worried.

6. Pain just before hard work, example writing or working out!
Just before you begin work or workout even, I have seen this thing. I noticed it in my friends blog as well. He informs about how he gets pain as soon as he thinks about doing some hard work. I have noticed this multiple times. Just when I am about to start a work out, I will get pain - an indication from the body to not do a certain activity. I do it anyways. Can't remember it turning out to be the worst in the recent days.

#### **The After**
I am not sure I could have written for three days straight with very little sleep and mighty amount of clicking and scrolling. Thats how I completed my thesis during the last days 4 months ago. What type of exercise I did to build up to such a level of non-rsiness you ask? NOTHING. Not to mention my well behaved back. Good boy!

Feels great to sleep where ever the fuck I want. I went back home a month back, felt great to sleep on those very same beds with bumps without giving an external fuck!

Squats stared! Even after Dr. Saruno happened, I tried squats without weights and regretted it. This was in the beginning months of learning of the treatment. Then I started to do leg extension, leg curl and press. I have been on and off to the gym due to various reasons. Last month has been good with good number of times at the gym. And finally started Squats without weight. Last three times have been good. Will keep continuing, and make minor modifications and get them legs burnt.

Climbing stairs now! I climb the stairs for a floor 5-10 times atleast in a day. I have been living in this house for about 5 months now.

After I learned of the treatment, I slowly started pumping about 80 kg on legpress and 50 kg on leg extension. As opposed to just a few months back 20 kg leg pressing.

I used to jog 10-12 minutes a once in a while and would be so consicous of pain and would get pain invariably. Today I just did 3min walk-5min-run-1min rest-11 min run- 2 min cooldown, had pain in various parts of the knee, now and then, well I talked to it. I can't rememeber having pain after running, a day after, or during the next workout. I eat well to make sure I give my body the necessary nutrients (more on this later).

A particular one that I am not quite proud of. I installed this app to measure how much time I spend on the phone. As I was suffering from major pain in the hand "due to excessive usage" (6 hrs a day). After I learned the of the treatment, I have clocked similar times with similar settings. The obvious needn't be stated:)

Did a trip to kerala in a motherfucking vehicle recently. Full road trip. Last I did this was in April 2014 a month before shit went haywire! Its been 2.5 years now.

I am back baby, the real journey begins now!

#### **Way of the future**
With BP and KP my fear is that the pain in my head might be combined with real pain. Although I have not evidence to support it, I believe my caution can be worth while. What I mean by that is that I will not go full retard immediately. I will not start running 6 days a week. I will not go to the gym and start pumping huge amounts of iron every alternate day. I will first run every time I go to the gym, i.e, 2 times a week. Without pain, after workout and during the next days, I shall start increasing the dosage. Same with working out, I plan to first come as far as 3 slow pull ups and continue for a while before I move to the intermediate workout.

#### **Thank You**
I would like to thank an STM, whose esteemed existance has helped me so much in life. I wanted to always write him this post and only found the patience to do so now, literally 6 months after I got pretty darn cured.

#### **Disclaimer**
Of course exercise caution while attempting the principles, avoid going full retard. Upgrade slowly and good luck. It is possible the pain is not in your head alone, so exercise cautiously or get in touch with a doctor I guess.

#### **Conclusion**
I believe I have come a long way with the RSI, KP, and BP. I feel like I am young again. Today, I skipped every alternate step in the stairs from the third floor, just like when I was a kid. As I speak of it, I realize a growing pain in my knee, I wonder if thats real? I am not too worried about it. And two days later I continue writing this paragraph, "what pain?", I asked!

#### **Update**
5/02/2017 
I have been sitting for about an hour eating and watching youtube. I come back and plan that I am going to write
Baam NP in a few minutes!

11/02/2017
Wanted to finish a few things at work and realised it might take more time than expected, got a little stresses, and guess who showed up! Hand pain! Wow, I was clicking like a bitch the entire day, only using my right hand to go through catalogues to select components, and placing things on powerpoints. For a second I got worried, then I told my self , "I reapeat again, we have more important things to deal with, please go away, dont stop me". I continued to work with the same fervor. I can't remmeber when it vanished, but I can tell that after that instant I didnt think of it again. Poof! Gone!

In between these two dates tried squats without weights but kept hands close to the body. Afraid I am doing it wrong though. Felt pain during work out, got afraid and then continued to do it the next time. Volla pandian. I still need to check the posture once again.

One week back on a saturday, played football 2 hrs straight on a concrete surface. Ran like a motherfucker. Wow. The feeling. Count't walk the next few days due to severe soreness, minute bp after a day. For the first time in ~2 years I really did an intense session where I had used some of the muscles much more than they were capable of. 
Inner thigh Muscle still sore. Played for .5 hrs to 1 hr yesterday. Limping and still playing. Lack of mobility owing to sore muscles. No knee pain. Inner thigh muscles need focus. BP, KP, RSI alles Gut!

A week back I tried to run for 20 mins or play basket ball every day. On one day I had actual knee pain, but got back in form almost immediately.

Trying to run as many days as possible. Been running 4 times a week including 2 times during workouts and 2 times outside. Playing football for around 1.5 hrs everyweek.

Current attempt is to go to the gym 3 days a week. Mon and today(wednesday) done. next lets see friday. 

I think even on monday I got some pain in the knee while running, don't remember what happened to it after. I just keep running, I keep telling myself this is not real. I seem to be fine the next day. 

Happily scooby type squatting nowadays. 10 kg with ease, 8 reps, 3 sets. Planking with 10kg on the back. side planking with 12 kg. Pushing myself. Enjoying. 

Alles gut!

Still play football like a mad ass, after which I can't move a lot every saturday. Last saturday I also fell down on my knee, luckily, I can still run, and do all my exercises. 

Day before yesterday I started actual barbell squats, not sure if my posture is right. Doing it slowly and keeping back "straight" and leaning a lot for some reason.

Notice that I feel a lot of stress in my back after doing squats with 12 kg. Need to look into more details of how to do it. Of course there is nothing wrong with me.

Recently I also noticed some very weird uncomfortableness in my back at work, I don't give a fuck about it, but it is odd. It feels like old times ;). Sitting really low seems to be the most comfortable position. 

Over the last few days, I found myself waking up with a wierd back pull for a few days, I don't seem to have it anymore.

When I rest my ankle on my other foot, I sometimes see that the knee joints ache. I still run 20 minutes when I go to the gym, sometimes my knees slightly ache, push through it and can't remember feeling anything later.

Doing a lot of powerpoint, clicking etc, no rsi.

Today I ran for 20 mins and did squats as part of my workout. I see pain in the back (bp). felt very uncomfortable sitting while working in the evening. Very conscious. Recently I heard that my bp can be caused by lack of vitamin D. Oops! I am quite worried about it.

Did spartan workout last thursday. Did more pushups than before. Not running regularly. But playing basket ball and TT. Played on 25th both the sports and I think it gave me quite some stress in the back. I am alright now. I even went to the gym. Sticking to the don't care attitude. Ran for 20 mins on the treadmill like a bitch today. I had nech ache while writing todays post. I told myself to fuck off. Can't remember when it went, but it was gone. Guess what its back now, when I wrting about this again!
