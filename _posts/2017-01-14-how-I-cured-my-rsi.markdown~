#### **A few months back at the RSI Anonymous**
Hi I am an Agent and **I used to suffer** from RSI. (Hear Here!) And this is my story...

----
KP - Knee Pain
BP - Back Pain
RSI - Repetitive Stress Injury
#### **The Synopsis**

Around 3-4 years back I had my first encounter with RSI aka Repetitive Stress Injury. It was "_natural_" then, for me to conclude the "_obvious_" that I was clicking the mouse like a Bitch and hence I got RSI. Along with this, overworking like crazy, sitting in "bad chairs" and riding bikes for long distances, I "_figured_" that I have back pain as a result. During this time I also had small encounters with knee pain. Of course, all around me there were people sitting like this, who were my peers and didn;t give two shits about posture (picture: Bargy). I used to think, man, one day he's going to face the music. 

I was like a boy who didn't give two shits about posture and the like, until he realized he was growing old (pain being a sign of old-age). The scary part being that this was going to be part of my life from now on. Following these issues, I switched to using only the keyboard (ergonomic where possible)(for my RSI), used ergonomic postures only (for my BP) and didn't use the stairs much (for my KP). It worked I guess, in keeping the pain off, but this is boring. I wanted to do more, in life and work and would need to improve the then current state of my health much much more. Around 10 months back, I figured I would have a job that could only involve clicking the mouse and panicked. I revisited my friends blog on how [he cured his RSI][stm].

The cure was extremely simple and cost me $0. I read a lot of material online via the [friends post][stm], testimonials from people who cured their life off of RSI **and that was it**. The cure had begun, then some very small tricks to keep my self in track.

Long story short, within the very same week I started reading about rsi, I got cured of it. By cured I mean like fuck I-don't-give-a-shit-no-more-about-RSI cured. I have grown to the level of I-don't-give-a-fuck-pretty-much with regard to BP. This later 'level' took more like a few months to stabilize. I happily workout and am never scared of looking at a chair without back rest. I run once in 3-4 days, for about 20 mins with gradual buildups and 1 min breaks every 3-5 mins. All the credit goes to the theory and friends who helped me in this journey.

Hear Here!

#### **About me**
I am a mechanical engineer, 26 years old, who works with FEM and CAD a lot, i.e., clicking like a bitch. Majority of my work is to sit in front of a computer. I am an atheist, non-believer of astrology and the like, opposed to "alternative" medicine and so on. I say this to inform you that it takes much more than the quintessential bullshit to persuade me to try out something - to say the least, not fully scientific. I am not trying to say I am the Rationalest fuck you will ever come across, I suck, NO CONTEST (more on this later). 

The cure for RSI, BP and the like proposed by [Dr. John Saruno][Saruno_wiki], is contrary to conventional wisdom. Sounds in the beginning like those fake miracle cures, where they instantly make your leg grow back or cure you of your cancer. But however, this miracle is different. There is a lot of evidence and things that go for it. The first being this theory was proposed by [Dr. John Saruno][Saruno_wiki], who is an actual doctor. [Harvard][harvard] made a small study with its students. The transformation claims in the [news video][youtube_BP] are phenomenal, the [thank-you-testimonials][thankyou] which contains so many people thanking Saruno for giving them back their lives and the '[reviews of his book on amazon][amazon]'. My very good friend [an STM] also had this issue, and cured himself using Dr. Sarunos ideas, although he didn't have to buy or read the book. He is one of the only reasons I had started off on this journey. I don't think I ever thanked him.

I urge you all to take the time and go through the above links (atleast) and my journey and be cured, if the pain was just in your head. Hope it helps.

#### **Pain begins**
I just finished my bachelors, which means I was about 22 years old (2012). I joined in a research institute to work. It involved CAD and FEM. It slowly went on to working late in the evening and clicking the mouse more and more. Thats when I had my first experience with RSI. It got pretty bad, and I started taking advice from my prof who has carpel tunnel regarding exercises and so on. I used to switch to the left hand and have shortcut commands to ease work. I think my friend informed me that writing on the keyboard is much less painfull than using the mouse and I took to it. _I believed it. I got an ergonomic keyboard and mouse to save my hand from more damage. The particular mouse I absolutely didn't use as it was so uncomfortable and slowing me down. 

I used to travel on the bike for about 18 km a day atleast. Plus I was sitting for long hrs without eating properly. "_Naturally_" I assumed these were the reasons I found myself with BP. Welcome!

I used to climb the stairs of 2 floors quite often at work. "_Naturally_" I assumed this was the reason I found myself with KP. Welcome!

Towards the end of my tenure at the research institute, i.e., 24 years old, I was pretty OK. Occasional bouts with back pain. But I was playing tennis and all. About an hr a day for around 7-9 months already. I also did a fucking road trip on a car which involved traveling about 18 hrs I think, one way. Fuck yeah! I was atleast fine. 


#### **Pain rises**
In about three months I was on my way to Netherlands for my masters (Aug, 2014) and quit my job. I wanted to bulk the fuck up. I started working out, and was too retarded and stupid to start with the beginners work out, started pumping huge amounts (20 kg bench press for my level) of iron at the gym. One day, when I was doing lunges or squats I think I pulled my back. From then one things went straight downhill.

Three months straight I was almost bedridden. Everything caused BP but not of unbearable levels. **I panicked**. The very sight of BP is bad right? I had BP all the fucking time. Some of the worst days of my life. Anything I did, caused backpain to the point that it didn't make sense. The place where I had pain kept changing, it was not consistent, but throughout my back. I went to atleast 3 doctors and multiple times. MRI, Xray, all fine. Everyone suggested some exercise and some pain killers. Can't remember anything working or seeing any progress. One day I am doing what ever the fuck I want and in within a few days my life is completely fucked. Nothing ended up not giving BP. Sitting with backrest, lying down, traveling in a car or bus, sitting without backrest, sitting on plastic chairs at home, sleeping on the mattress at home (which had some bumps and so some positions seemed to work and some not). Feeling bored just lying down and also becoming fat, I tried swimming, getting back to tennis, all the while continuing my exercise. Somehow, I just ended up lying down all the time and as much as I could. You know resting and shit. 

If I went to my friends place, lied down there as well. They cracked jokes at me big time for doing that. Where ever I went I lied down. It was extremely hard to sit for one hr even I guess. I remember going to meet my brothers in laws before marriage, and I was stuck in this shitty chair and couldn't rest my back at all. Very uncomfortable times. Friends came to visit me at home as I was leaving to Netherlands for my masters, even at that time, I stayed predominantly lying down and speaking to them.

At one point I was ready to pay this dickhead who looked at me for less than a minute and said I have chronic BP and that he will cure me and asked for 20k rs. It was obvious he was trying to mint money out of me, but I was still hope-full. For some reason I didn't follow it up with him. Had too many bad reviews I think!

During this time I also managed to do a 6 hr trip to home in car with my family, with one hr breaks to twist my back.

To add to all this, I had a totally unconnected surgery (pilunoidal sinus) which screwed my ability to sit even more for a while.

#### **Pain mildens but wait**

I took a flight to Netherlands, about 13 hrs. I never imagined my flight to Netherlands would be so free of pain. I am probably biased or having some major inaccuracies in my story, but as far as I remember, I had no/very little pain. Very peaceful, just taking care of healing my wound due to that unconnected surgery. It just didn't't add up. Until one day I am lying down most of the time. And then suddenly riding a plane without much issues! WHaaaaaaaaT! ALMOST AS IF SUDDENLY I was doing things that previously I hadn't imagined I'd do. 

Once I came to Netherlands, I think I found the chair that "works" for my back, the mattress at my new house already was good enough! Hmmm! Interesting ;). I was worried about getting a cycle, and guess what, no problems there either, the cycle I test tried worked for my back! Whaaaaaaat (high-pitched this time)! What are the odds! 

I was not completely free of pain. BP was the main issue in my life at this time as I pretty much stuck to the keyboard and typing. I went the ergonomic way, managing posture and the placement of screens and so on. Got in touch with a phisio and was reporting to her the whole issue. I would have to tell her my entire story every time and she would somehow "grasp"(yeah right!) what my issue has been holistically! Anyways, she suggested I do some work out. I liked the idea as I was also being hidden-obese during that time, with a  big belly and was afraid to start anything.

Started going to the gym and after a while with the beginners workout and little pain or reduced pain. I moved to the intermediate workout. I took care of things to a great level, making sure my trainer checks my posture and gives me numbers to set on the machine to adjust height. Things didn't appear to look good. I guess I didn't recover afterall. Either I did a lot of weight or screwed up with posture or I was not ready to move to the next phase. Shocked I ran to the phisio and she suggested I improve my core and suggested group exercises such as core stability. 

Core stability was awesome. I was completely exhausted at the end of the workout. I was doing core stability, climbing and spinning once a week. Things were slow and alright an I think I was still fat and bored when I decided to take a run and straight away did one for 1 full hr. Thats about the time I think knee pain became a major issue. Couldn't continue core stability any more, or for that matter spinning I think. KP started to intensify with core-stability. 

Exams happened, for about 1-2 months straight didn't do any workout, just went to the library, found my particular chair and worked on my computer for long hrs. Was totally fine for those months.

Went back home in july 2015 and had a peaceful time in India. Much better than the time I left for my masters, when I used to lye down all the time. 

After I came back started working out with extremely small weights. Just decided to go the scooby way. Pushup, pullup, legpress, leg curl and leg extension and a couple of core exercises. Here I was going to make absolutely sure that I was doing the lowest of weights, so that I don't stress my body. I did 5 kg on leg press and the absolute lowest. Quite challenging to do this when people watch you as though you don't got no muscle. I toughed it out, with the hope that I will someday be killing it. I pushed to about 20 kg, noted down when all I get pain and where all I get pain and studied my pain as I pushed my self in a small way every time I went to the gym. Life was chill regarding working out. Push ups and pull ups(assisted) didn't do anything to me. But I was keeping track and pushing myself majorly with increasing the reps to feel pumped and motivated about the workout. One fine day I came to the point of leg pressing 20 kg, without significant pain in the legs or back. I did this slowly, 8 reps after building up from 10 and 15 kgs in the first two sets. Leg extension, don't even ask, it was pathetic. The growth was slow, but I thought there was improvement and one day, I am going to be conquering the sun right and patience is a virtue.

#### **The Cure**
Life was alright for a while and I had to move to Munich for a period of seven months. My life recipe was I only used the keyboard, stuck to ergonomic postures, didn't climb the stairs, did low weights in the gym and life was alright. I was traveling about 2 hrs a day on train and figured I could use my laptop during that time to type. But you know how laptop keyboards are #Unergonomic, and I faintly remember getting pain having typed a lot (not sure, but I was typing a lot). What was I going to do? Everything involved the fingers, even reading a paper article was going to be a problem as I would have to hold it with my fingers. How was I going to cope with this loss of time? I reached a point where I had to decide what my career was going to be in. I could not come to terms with the work available. It had to be either CAD(designer) or be a FEM engineer. Both of which required quite a lot of clicking. Afraid and panicky I went back to the post by my friend. Read the related data. One thing that was "apparent" to me was that the [book][amazon] could cure. I looked online, it was pricy for my budget or the cheaper version took very long to arrive. I checked with my friend and he amended his post.

> I have not bought the book by John Saruno. The above articles were enough to do the job for me.

I followed suit. I am not sure about the exact time frame but it was less than 3-5 days when I had a mouse clicking task. I think almost the very next day I took on to making a powerpoint for the whole day or so, where I clicked like a Bitch. And the pain you ask! Well lets just say it was hardly there. The same weekend, I wrote like a bitch on my laptop keyboard, the whole fucking time. After that point, I can't really remember having RSI. Very rarely, I got a tingling in my hand or even pain, but all it took was looking at my hand and speaking to it. And then just continue. RSI! Bye Bye.

#### **The Extension**
I started reading about BP and how it might be connected to RSI. Turns out my [thalaivan][Saruno_wiki], kicks ass there as well. I saw related posts. I clearly remember this one thing in Munich. I had a very bad chair (one without backrest) when I first went to my Munich home. I immediately started looking for chairs. For the first few days as soon as I came home I would go to sleep or lyedown almost asap. As I couldn't handle doing things without a proper back rest, or so I thought. BP would creep up as I sat without backrest. I don't know how the link happened but then I found that Saruno had written a book on BP! God bless that MAN! 

I found this amazing inspiring tale of this guy. In fear that I might not find it again I quote it partially here. The amazon book link is [here][amazon_BP]. The actual review is [here][amazon_review_BP].
 >The book came. I read it. It took about 1.5 hours (it's short and written for laypeople). I decided to try it. I went outside and ran up the steps by my house. I hadn't walked more than a few steps in months. The run hurt like hell, but it didn't make anything worse. So I committed. I went to the movies that night. I was terrified of sitting for two hours, but every time the pain would flare up I would internally remind myself that it was because of my internal pain, rage, whatever you call it. I spent a lot of time reminding myself of this, and I doubted myself. But within 2 days, I really was able to do some things, and I started to believe. I definitely still had pain, but I worked on it. Really, really hard. And I made myself do the things I was most afraid of doing. Going to the pilates class I was sure would injure my back. Going hiking on the same trail that precipitated the whole thing. Going to spin class. And I couldn't believe I was able to do these things. I forced myself to do anything I was afraid of. I repeated the refrain "there is nothing wrong with you" probably a million times.

I followed it up with a [youtube video][youtube_BP] on my thalivan and fully on BP. 

With BP as is the disclaimer, it took time and the cure was not instantaneous like rsi. I re-watched the video often to internalize that there is nothing wrong with me. Soon, I can't remember when, I slowly started giving less of a fuck about posture. I started to sit on my ass bent like a bitch. Like all them young niggas I kept seeing around me,  I sad on every chair. 

I do get backpain now and then, much more frequently that RSI. But I feel the trick is in not giving a hit especially for things as silly as posture.

Even as I write this post, I had to forgo my chair for some reasons. Sat on the bed without back rest. Tingling feeling now and then but who cares. Isn't that the game! However I am still wary of my back ad am slowly increasing the dosage at the gym. Like super slowly. Back in Munich, I still was scared to do squats. I tried it one day with so much fear. Videos by scooby were like, if you have BP then be extra careful. Man I started doing extensions, leg press, and so many other fucking things. I legpressed about 80 kg max, (progressively over a few weeks of cours.e). And I was still afraid like hell to try out squats. Over conscious about my position I try to squat just a few times at home as practice, and I had it. Massive pain and I left it at that. 

Now that I am here in delft I am slowly introducing it. Been doing the beginners workout only. Squats without weight. Not any pain that I feel the next day informing that I fucked up, Thats pretty much my theory. 

Same with the knee extended to it. I remember the time before Saruno, how I would run to the station about 400 m I guess in 5 mins to catch the train. Rarely I have seen it give me knee pain. 


#### **Treatments**
Ergonomic keyboard
Doctors for BP
Phisio
Ergonomic sitting postures
workrave




#### **The odd things**
1. right hand and left hand
2. Netherlands travel
3. ability to sit for 12 hrs atleast doing my work, provided I got the right chair. for 2 months straight. No exercise in between

4. running to the station like a mad cow
5. Neck pain, Why doesn't it stay... when I am in the zone, I can't remember it!

Just before you begine work or so!
#### **The CURE**

#### **Before after**
In august 2016 I had to submit my thesis, I wrote like a bitch the last three days staright up no sleep writing.

I just ran my first 20 mins with 6 mins  continous, when 12 mins couldnt do

I don't give a shit about sleeping position or mattress

Squats stared. Munich didn't work

climbing stairs now!

Motherfucker I pumped 80 kg at the leg press machine! Suck my dick! as opposed to the 20 kg
I extended 50 motherfucking kg. Ridiculous for my standards. as opposed to 10-15 max

Running 10 to 12 mins    

#### **Way of the future?**
BP and kp slowly build them up!
