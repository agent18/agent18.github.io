## Entry question

What should I do next? Should I go for a Master's? Should I upskill for
EA Orgs?

## EA jobs have high impact in Research

I am going to try making a lifetime impact calculation (very rough)
based on [Milan Griffes attempt here](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/). [People seem hesitant to
make such calculations](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/afDCCvCsZcz8axoPp/examples-for-impact-of-working-at-eaorg-instead-of-etg) for some reason. And somehow they are able
to make decisions without these. All I want to do is just see if it is
even worth spending time to be a researcher in the [already crowded
space](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reflections-our-2018-generalist-research-analyst-recruiting) (OPPs recent hiring round).

GiveWell moved 110m`$` in 2015. An entry level researcher's
contribution is expected to be [10% of a co-founder](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/05/givewells-progress-in-2015/). Over a
lifetime I find it hard to believe that one will be stuck at 10% of
the co-founder contribution. With time one would move up the ladder
and on average *I assume* one is at `30%` the co-founder
contribution. GiveWell employed [9 co-founders](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/05/givewells-progress-in-2015/) that year. So we
get a multiplying factor `0.3/9`.

Just like we divide the impact of the org among the different people,
it seems appropriate that we should also divide the impact of the 110m
that GiveWell moves, among the following: the Donors (e.g., Good
Ventures), the middle men (GiveWell) and the intervention Orgs
(AMF). The impact from the 110m`$` seems to belong to each of these
Orgs. *I assume* all Orgs have equal weight in this, for lack of any
other better estimate. So we get a multiplying factor `0.33`.

**Replaceability of org**

Now we get into counterfactual estimates of the org itself. What is
the utility to the world if GiveWell existed, minus when they didn't
exist. I don't know how to estimate this but it appears [80000hours
uses a factor `<=0.3`](https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/fnBnEiwged7y5vQFf/triple-counting-impact-in-ea/comment/CWxdafynvn3nQ7v9b) to estimate their counterfactual impact. We
shall roll with this, for lack of any better estimate. So *we assume*
`0.3` again.

So far the Impact for a researcher at GiveWell is estimated to be
`0.3/9x0.33x0.3x110m=363k`. This final value is TOO sensitive to any
changes in the factors listed above. For example, if the 'Contribution
of the Org', changed from 0.3 to 0.4, then the outcome increases by
about 100k`$` to 484k`$`.

**Replaceability of person**

Counterfactual estimates for the impact created by a person in an EA
job, is the difference in impact between, when he takes the job and
when he doesn't. This is quite hard to predict. It not only depends on
the next candidate who didn't get this job, but what that next
candidate did (spillover-effects). "Did he end up displacing other
people in EA?", "What happened in the rest of the displacement chain?"
etc...

Depending on the situation this can vary from 0 to 363k`$`. Imagine a
job opening where anyone who meets a "very high bar" can get that
research position as there are enough funds for it. Such a person
seems to take credit for all of the 363k. However, imagine a case
where there are 2 similarly skilled people for one job that was
open. `A` gets the job and `B` can do ETG but can donate only a few
100`$` a year. This makes the counterfactual impact of `A` = 100`$`.
  
In reality there are many people and it is hard to trace the actual
impact. Attempting to make estimates seems to need a lot more
assumptions which I am unable to back up with data or examples. Moving
on!

**Conclusion**

It appears that EA work has a lot of potential to do good ranging from
0k`$` to even >363k`$`. My problem is there is a lot of uncertainty. And
this number could be extremely high (even in millions) depending on
the type of work one chooses and how much better he is than others.

## Hard to get EA jobs. Needs credentials.

In the essay on ["Talent Constraint"](/is-ea-bottlenecked-stm-2.html), this table below was
presented. It shows how hard getting an EA job is.

It takes [a few years to break into EA](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but). For Peter, apparently it
took him 5 years of hardwork to get to founding his own org. MSJ, to
get an internship in CE, took 2-4 years and quite some hardwork
(writing your own research, showing up at EA conferences, criticizing
research etc...). For Saulius, it took about 2 years and 2
internships.

I recently apped for an internship and didn't get it. I probably need
to work on it for a few years and copy actions of these examples. In
addition I really suck at understanding claims, so add a few more
years!

**Conclusion**: It could take about 2-5 years and "a lot of hard work"
before I get into an EA org. The counterfactual impact "depends". The
chances for success are unknown, and its getting quite competitive as
expressed in the acceptance rates.

## DS for ETG

I am going to focus on DS instead of CS, for DS involves "critical
thinking", working with statistics, working with claims, hypothesis
testing etc.--things that seem to help become a better EA researcher
(in case I need them in the future). Also Earning potential wise, it
appears there is not "much difference" ([looking at the average
salaries](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/which-is-more-promising-data-science-or-software-engineering-7e425e9ec4f4)). So we stick with DS.

Earning potential is quite high in the US. Earnings are substantially
larger than here in Netherlands (or Europe). I know DS people with
4yoe in Apple California earning 300k`$` TC and others in Walmart with
300k`$` TC. While here (Netherlands) people seem to be [earning
78-103k](https://www.glassdoor.nl/Salarissen/Booking-com-Data-Scientist-Amsterdam-Salarissen-EJI_IE256653.0,11_KO12,26_IL.27,36_IM1112.htm?experienceLevel=ONE_TO_THREE) as per Glassdoor. With such salaries as in the US there
are people like ([Jeff Kaufman](https://www.jefftk.com/donations)) who are able to donate 50%. This
amounts to about 150k`$` per year with a 300k`$` TC.

There are 2 ways many people I know take, to get to the US. People
take the masters route, and then work towards an H1B visa which allows
you to work there. The other route is the L1 route. In this case you
work in say Amazon in India (for e.g.,) and then try to move to the US
on an L1.

**Chances are low to make it in the US**

There are random factors associated with working in US. Getting an H1B
is based on lottery. Whether you are doing an L1 or Masters in the US
you end up having to deal with H1B at some point--either after
Master's or before your L1 expires (<5years). There seems to be a
`60%` chance that a person like me will clear this hurdle [^2]. This
is including atleast 3 tries at H1B (i.e., 1-3 years of applying).

In addition, the US is not the most friendly place for workers
rights. Once you loose a job you have [60 days to find another
job](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/just-got-laid-off-h-1b-job-i-any-grace-period-can-i-another-visa-jobhunt.html). In times of recession (like in 2008 or during the Corona
period), the chance of loosing the job seems to be about 15%[^5] and
might mean a one way ticket back to home. This comes to a multiplying
factor of `85%`.

For Master's route, I think I have "good" chances of getting a DS job
in FAANG with 2-3 yoe (not including the H1B chances). I have seen
examples of people in FAANG whom I know well, and thus think it is
definitely within reach comparing myself to them. Worst case it should
be possible to atleast get a DS job in California, from where I can
grow into FAANG. People are able to do bootcamps and join DS from
different industries such as [Electrical Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashankmaiya/). This
suggests to me that it is definitely not out of reach. Let's put this
at `80%`. So in total, `60%x84.6%x80%=40%` chance of making it.

For the L1 route, the biggest hurdle would be to find a company that
is L1-able. There are examples I have come across, across fields and
countries. There are people who went all the way to JP Morgan in New
York on an L1 after a few years in India and [SWe engineers from India
who are now in FAANG](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramshandilya/). ~~People demanding a job in US because they
are good and pushing for a job there.~~ Atleast for mechanical
background, people from ASML Netherlands regularly work in the US for
a few years on L1. It seems accessible. I have to look into the
possibilities more for DS people in Netherlands. Say `60-80%`
chance. So in total, `30%` to `40%`.

**DS Costs (time and money)**

With the Master's route based on examples I have seen, 4 to 6 years to
a FAANG 300k`$` TC job (2-4 yoe + 2y for masters). With the L1 route 2-3
yoe + 2-5 years before getting H1B transfer. So, 4-8 years from now.

With the regular masters route, I would have to spend 50-70k`$` at a
public university and mostly can't work during that time--becoming a
total of 70-90k`$` (including the opportunity costs). With the L1 route,
I think I have to do an online masters (estimated at [20k](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7o21qw/berkeley_master_data_science_mids_vs_other_online/) for 2
years) atleast to be able to defend an RFE[^4] and also to improve
chances with H1B[^9]. But I will be working during that time and can
cover my costs as it will be part time.

**Forget spending 2 hrs a day on things related to EA**  

With the Master's route, combined with my actual 9-5 job I think there
is not going to be much time until I reach FAANG. Starting with a DS
Masters implies that for the next 4-7 years I will be investing all my
resources on making it into FAANG. First I start with GRE, get a job
here (NL) in DS, work out the universities, apply, send documents,
talk to people about where to go etc. During Master's I think I will
tend to spend all my time to get better grades and work on DS, and
apply for jobs. I would want to do everything in my power to learn
skills needed and get good grades to maximize my chances. Until I
reach FAANG, I would be doing things that can improve my chances.

With the L1 route, I think the same holds too. If I end up working in
Netherlands and doing a masters part-time, there is going to be no
time. Forget spending 2 hrs a day. Once I get to the US on L1 I will
be working on getting an H1B type job. That would be the focus. So
both cases I guess that spending time to build "EA related skills" is
gonna be hard during the time leading to FAANG.

**When I fail**

The probabilities are sub 50% for success in either cases. In case I
fail to make it to the US, I am stuck with very low ETG (5-10k). And
furthermore it is going to be much harder to start my journey into
EA. I will be in my 33-36's and I am afraid its gonna be "harder"
than now as I would have passed several "crucial years" (4-7) where I
could have spent learning "skills related to an EA".

In the Master's case this seems to imply that I could be in debt of
50-70k`$` in case things don't work out (worst-case). This means that I
have to pay my debt for another 5-7 years before I can potentially ETG
again. For the L1 case, atleast I am not in going to be in debt.

Considering the debt part alone and the reduced anxiety due to that, I
would prefer the L1 route. It is still unclear what the chances are
with meeting an L1-able company. L1 on the other hand also allows you
to gain a few years (2-4y) experience before applying to FAANG
(increasing the chances). However, in theory if someone pays for my
Master's (my brother perhaps) and I had "experience" (of 2-3 years),
then **both options are "almost" the same.**

---

## Conclusion

**DS route**  

The Impact with DS seems to be high in the order of 150k (and more
maybe) donations. Getting a job in the US seems to be coming in with a
probability of less than 50% be it Master's or be it the L1 route
(most of them are not in my control).

If this path is chosen, there is a good chance that I am unable to
sink my teeth into up-skilling myself, to break into EA (during the
4-8 years of pursuing this path). I would be in my 33-36's if I crash
and burn. I am afraid its gonna be "much harder than now" to try EA as
I would have passed several crucial years (4-7) where I could have
spent learning skills related to an EA.

**EA route**

So far we have seen that breaking into EA can take 2-5 years and a
"lot of hard work". The probabilities for success are unclear, but the
impact seems to have a lot of potential i.e., >350k`$` (the lower limit
could be as low as few k's; very hard to estimate currently).

If this path is chosen, it means that I still need a day job (25-40
hrs). Continuing to work on my usual MechE job is possible until a
time that I am able to move to EA full-time.

In case I crash and burn, then all I have is some skills that possibly
wont help me in ETG. MechE is a low paying job. And moving to DS will
be "much harder than now". So I am delayed by 2-5 years in getting
started with DS.

**The path that has it all?**

Having to restart after 4-8 years "sounds like a bad idea". I will be
older in my 34s to 38s, and am not sure about how it is perceived and
if I can get a master's at that time, if I can move jobs etc...

However there seems to be a "better" route. Instead of uselessly
clocking time on MechE, and not having back-up options, I could first
quickly change to a DS job (3-6 months). From there on I could pursue
EA route in the evenings and weekends, while I still clock DS
time. Granted I wont become great at DS but I will have yoe atleast,
and when I crash and burn, I wont be starting anything from scratch.

## Footnotes

[^2]: **Probability calculation**


	The number of times a person can apply for H1B on a Master's is around
	[3 times on a STEM OPT](https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-can-I-apply-for-a-H1B-visa-after-getting-STEM-Masters) (answer by Carlos Cueva). With an L1, we
	assume we are ready from the 3rd year on to apply for an H1B (having
	secured another job by then). So we will have the same 3 chances to
	apply for H1b. 

	**Note:** Some companies do not hire you in your OPT and don't have
	[atleast 2 attempts](https://www.teamblind.com/post/FAANG-that-accepts-candidate-with-less-than-24-month-OPT-46DqLqvB) left. Also there is a possibility of applying
	with many H1B sponsors for the same year with different employers. So
	lets assume I have 3 tries for now.

	Based on a 50% split between the general pool and the advanced pool
	([which is what the DHS have assumed](https://www.happyschools.com/h1b-visa-2020-probability-lottery/)), we see that 1 H1B attempt
	has a [41.9% chance of success](https://bintlr.work/h1bProbabilityEstimate.html) for students with Masters.

	After you are selected in the lottery, you are either approved or
	rejected or requested for an [RFE](https://goh1b.com/en/blog/2019/07/02/what-does-h1b-rfe-mean-most-common-reasons/). The cases for RFE have become
	"much higher" [(33% in 2019 from 10% in 2016)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2019/08/08/latest-uscis-data-show-increase-in-denials-for-new-h-1b-visas/#5443e3417cc4) over the trump era
	and one of the things they seem to be scrutinizing the people for not
	having the **right background/experience for the work**. This comes
	under "Beneficiary qualifications". Naturally, this scares me as I
	have a mechanical Master's and Bachelor's. Another common issue seen
	is called "Speciality Occupation". The **position needs to qualify as
	a speciality occupation**. Apparently[ USCIS does not usually think a
	job is "special enough", if they don't seem to have the need of
	relevant bachelor's](https://ogletree.com/insights/uscis-issues-top-10-reasons-for-h-1b-requests-for-evidence/). If you look on [trackitt](https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/h1b), you do see that
	"most" of the rejects are cited based on this "Specialty Occupation"
	or "lack of relevant degree" (Beneficiary qualifications I presume). I
	seem like a prime suspect for atleast lack of "beneficiary
	qualifications". Thus, I take a 100% chance of getting an RFE.

	Whether the RFE gets approved or not seems to be random. There are
	cases of people with Bachelor's and Master's in Mechanical who have
	made it to software job after their RFEs ([ronaldo7!](https://www.teamblind.com/post/6mTKzvNm),[tiger12](https://www.teamblind.com/post/H1B-RFE-Data-Scientist-III-PqF7wkMk))
	post 2018. And then there are people with Master's in Financial
	Mathematics who are denied after their RFE to a CS/DS job
	([9mineHwang](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Im-a-data-scientist-and-I-got-a-H1B-RFE-again-UvhDqaXm)). A Hiring manager at Amazon sums up what a giant
	cluster fuck of a mess it is: "One of my report’s visa was rejected
	saying the job is not a specialty occupation and doesn’t need
	bachelors degree which is ridiculous as why would Amazon pay that
	person $300K per year for a non-specialty job.  The decision on visa
	application has become so arbitrary that the outcome is not known.
	One employee has one application rejected and the same application was
	approved the second time."---[hiring manager Amazon](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Immigration-Mess-sAYGCXgg). 

	[According to Fragoman](https://www.fragomen.com/insights/alerts/latest-uscis-data-confirm-continued-high-rates-nonimmigrant-rfes-and-denials-fy-2019) the Success amounts to 60.4%. So, `41.9% x
	100% x 60.4%=25.3%` for 1 attempt of H1B. Over three attempts the
	chance becomes `1-(1-25.3%)^3`=58%.

	<!-- 2020-04-24-Data-Science.markdown has info on the probabilities
	--> <!-- and 2020-05-04-career-update.markdown -->

[^4]: **Why an online masters from US "accredited university" is
	important to defend RFE?**

	If you look on [trackitt](https://www.trackitt.com/usa-immigration-trackers/h1b), you do see that "most" of the rejects
    are cited based on this "Specialty Occupation" or "lack of
    relevant degree" (Beneficiary qualifications I presume). I seem
    like a prime suspect for atleast lack of "beneficiary
    qualifications". Defending a Data science related RFE of
    `Beneficiary qualifications` with Mechanical degree (Bachelor's
    and Master's) might turn out to be hard or atleast incentivizing
    people at USCIS to reject me. People with Electronics backgrounds
    with such a "BQ" RFE, seem to show how each subject is related to
    computer science in their rebuttal to USCIS.
	
	Despite the fact that the RFE rejections looking random--as they even
	[reject CS students for SWe jobs](https://www.teamblind.com/post/RFE-TIMELINES-FOR-FEB-2020-mbNwVE8r)--it appears that pushing for a
	degree *might help* an RFE with "Beneficiary Qualifications" atleast.

	Later I can get more info by contacting firms like FrogoMan.
	
[^5]: **Probability of layoffs**

	US has "had" about [8 recessions in a span of 70
	years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States). Assuming
	those are the only real times when your job is in danger we have the
	probability of no recession at: `11.4%`

	**% Layoffs during a recession for H1B people**

	In 2009 it is estimated that [650k people](https://cis.org/Memorandum/Estimating-Size-H1B-Population-US) were on H1B. Adding
	[230k H1B grants](https://bintlr.work/h1bProbabilityEstimate.html) every year, this brings the sum to a maximum of
	3m H1B people in the US.

	The logged layoffs in this current "recession" due to the pandemic
	fucking things up for H1B users in tech startups is logged at
	[layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/tracker/). It is currently 60k. If we assume all layoffs to be
	a factor 3 greater i.e., ~200k we get to *6% layoffs*. And mind you
	this number also has a "proportion" of Americans and GC holders and
	even layoffs in other countries, and hence appearing to be
	conservative.

	**The chance that you get laid off is**

	`(1-8/70)x(1-6%) = 83%`
