#### Story so far

3 months, 8 posts and averaging 1k words/post later, I still have not come to the conclusion on the path I plan to take, i.e, "Go behind girls or people". There are bigger decisions to be made from there on. 

> Now what the hell are you waiting for....    
- Numb/Encore

Over the last few weeks I notice that my writing is relaxed. In a week I probably try to write in the weekends and chill out through the week. I hardly spent time during the days. In anxious moments of life I prefer to just purely procrastinate. Such has been the last three months. I never have felt worthy enough to let know an STM of this blog. I am waiting to show him that I am in, and that this is it. I want to show him the evidence he deserves, so that we can finally co-conspire. Many a week have I thought to myself, that during this week I will Kill, I will write seven days a week and then inform an STM. But I have failed constantly. Promising a friend that I would pay him some money, didn't work as I ended up not paying him money once despite losing, and that became the norm I guess.

Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a miracle does not seem wise. 

#### **Now what?**
I want to improve my score of "number of arguments explained" and not "number of posts/words written". I want to crack the answers to the most hard problems I am facing. I want to do it fast. I am running out of time. I am 26 fucking years OLD.

I propose to do a 600 words a day post for the next 6 days with a penalty of 5 euros a post, paid a priori. I will get back the money for the week based on my performance. The money is gone now. The idea being to force myself to write everyday as I fucking need to.

A proper post classifies as one that has no spelling mistake, that is at least once read and corrected before posting. It needs to be posted the very same day.

#### **Goal**
My goal is to force myself to write everyday, make this the center of my life. Everything else can go to hell, as long as I write. Of course I do not measure anything now. I will leave it to an STM after a month to give out the verdict on which methods give best outputs(i.e., arguments explained). As I said, for now, goal is to keep writing like a maniac. Keep taking up harder problems and write write and write.

I cannot measure things like 'arguments explained' objectively. Thats why you leave it to a third party to do it. What needs to be measured, how it will be measured will be figured out at a later date. Writing forces me to think about issues. I want to expedite the process, and maybe writing 600 words a day helps.

I see writing as uncovering mystery. That is what I want to do and uncover more and more of the mystery, the prophecy and the related shabang! This experiment could also serve to get me back to writing regularly.

#### **What is the problem**

I would like to work on longer posts, write in much more detail by analyzing stuff. For example, say 1000 words post etc... I hear from an STM, that he will not read posts that are shorter than 1k words as they are mostly useless. There is so much to write about a topic and shortening it to just 600 words, I am afraid I will not be able to solve problems with it. 

Let's see in the coming days how it is and note our observations.

Peace
