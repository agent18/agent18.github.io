## Duration to study for GRE?

> As you can see, out of a random sample of a 1000+ 320+ scorers in
> GRE, we found that most of the students who score 320+ in GRE
> prepare for 45-90 days!  But, there are at least 200+ students who
> achieved a 320+ in GRE in just 30 days. --- [youtube greedge data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhZgalyrzCg)

Don't know what the median is but 45-90 days is what I should look at
(3s value prolly).

> how much time should you spend every day preparing for GRE?  Based
> on our 320 in GRE in 30 scorers, they have spent approximately 2.5
> hours/day to prepare for GRE.  With 1 hour & 15 mins on Quant & 1
> hour & 15 mins on Verbal!

3 hrs a day in 30 days. Doable



## GRE formate

2 verbal 2 quants and 1 writing + 1 experimental data collection 

Quants --> 

Verbal --> RC, vocabulary --> sentence completion, text equivalence, RC

writing --> 2 essays 

1 section --> 20 questions and 35 mins 

5 sections --> 175 mins

1 writing (2 essays) --> 60 mins 

GRE exam 200$ + 2 ets full tests + pdfs on overview of concepts

Can take GRE every 21 days 

Try 6-10 weeks and then gives you time to retry

## GRE At home

https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/register/at_home



## My plan

**Words**

800 words learning means 18 words a day in 45 days.

- kaplan 52

- kaplan flash cards 500

- Magoosh flash cards

- Barrons 800

See where this takes us.

**Verbal and quants questions per day**

There are 2500 questions in Kaplan. This would mean 52 questions a
day in 45 days. 

**Video lectures**

Video and read the kaplan book online. Finish them off first. Make
notes.

# GRE PREP from Kaplan
## Quantitative

### Mistakes

1. Missed decimals
2. x^2 = 25 means x=+-5;

### quantitative comparison

**You have definite relationship if there are numbers clearly given in
the A and B for**

e.g.,

A--> is **Subject**: from 19 to 31 and B is sum from 22 to 32.

So eliminate option D (no relationship). i.e., we only need to check
once.


**Strats**: 

1. choose number atleast twice
2. You can add subtract by any quantity, 
3. you can multiply and divide by positive values only.

i.e., g> 1 and A = g/g+3;

### Data interpretation

**In which of the years did wages increase by less than 1% of the wage
at the beginning of the year**

Apparently this means look at 2009 and 2010 (for the value of 2009).

**Look at graph to determine the year don't look at actual numbers first**

### Arithmetic

**What percent of 72 is 18 ?** It took me more time than usual.

**Is 12^34 divisible by 81, 144 and 28?** Not by 28. 

12^34 is 2^68 * 3^34 --> 81 is 3^4 clearly divisible, 144 is 12^2, so
clearly divisible, and 28 is 7*4, there is no 7 in this so this is the
wrong answer.

**Making mistakes while multiplying and subtracting (10s place)**

205*3.5 = ~707.5~ but it is 715.5 (Don't forget to multiply 10s place)

828.5-707.5 = 120 NOT but 121! 

### absolute values

Always think of them in terms of distance from the center


### Proportions ans ratios (star)

When asked "Ratio of boys and girls 5:13, there are 72 more girls than
boys, how many boys are there"

boys: 5x
girls: 13x
diff: 8x

8x = 72; x = 9. Now boys = 5x = 45. :)


---

"If y% of 140 is 112" => 112/140 = y%

### Rates (star)

Distance = Time x Rate

Time = Distance / Rate

Rate = Distance / time


**Distance is always at the top**

---

**2 people working on a project**

*You can add rates of people.*

Pandian takes 4 hrs to finish a job. Indian takes 6 hrs to finish a
job, how long for both to finish a job?

Pandian's rate is 1/4 project per hr. Indian's rate is 1/6 projects
per hr.

Together they can finish 10/24 projects in one hr. Which means
together they can finish 1 project in (look at the above formula), 

Time = 1 project / (10/24) projects per hr. :)

i.e., 2 2/5 hrs


**Formula for 2 people working on a project**

1/T = 1/T1 + 1/T2 i.e., T1xT2/(T1+T2) = T (time for one project)

**Multiply time by number of projects**

time for N projects = T*N

**Star mark question**

> In his Organic Chemistry class, Archibald has test scores of 82, 87,
> 88, and 95, with one test remaining. Which of the following scores
> on his final test would change his average by two percentage points?

his average by two percentage points --> +- 2 points. Direction is not
mentioned. But I assumed it like an idiot.


Make org-capture stuff question, tags, answer
### Gregmat

1. How to do charts:
https://www.gregmat.com/course/follow-the-process

### Integers

1. **Stick to prime numbers (`Is 4^17-2^28 divisible by 7?`)
while factorizing things.**

PRIME FACTORIZATION

### Strategies 

Which of following is even?

1. concept --> divisible by 2

2. Choose numbers --> odd and even 1 and 2



## Verbal

Topic : general subject matter Stone of scone

Scope : Who owns the scone, how it changed hands

Purpose : to explain history by also taking sides with scots

WAS THE AUTHOR NEUTRAL OR NOT?

1. Casu Marzu is dangerous to even posess in italy.

2. most sought-after still

3. european laws cheese flies and fly larvae drilled

4. chees is made by maggots

---

5. Detail question

Select a sentence that identifies the preventive process

1. Inference questions

Selection a choice that says  one of the followingk

1. global question

2. Logic question

--- 

3. Reasoning question

When you have a conclusion and an evidence,

1. To strengthen the argument you need something that brings
   conclusion and evidence close.
   
2. To weaken the argument you need something that gets them far away.


e.g.,

X and Y are two mayan cities whose ruins are found. Conculsion: They
both died in the same earthquake.

For this the Assumption needed to strengthen the conclusion would
somehow relate X & Y together.


### Reasoning

Contentment is directly related to an ability to mentally separate the
judgments of others from one’s own view of the results of one’s
actions. Thus, if you wish to be content, you should practice
releasing yourself from a sense of guilt for any failures.

Which of the following is an assumption made by the argument above? 
	Guilt is an unproductive emotion that should always be suppressed.   
	Those who are close to judgmental people cannot find any
	contentment.   
	Feelings of contentment are always preferable to feelings of
	guilt.  
	Contentment can easily be mentally separated from guilt.   
	Releasing guilt makes it easier to separate one’s own view from
	the judgments of others.   
	
	
**Conclusion**: (To be content)[1], (you should practice releasing yourself
from a sense of guilt for any failures)[2]

**Evidence**: (Contentment)[1] is related to (ability to mentally separate
the judgments of others from one's view.)[3]

The primary factor determining whether an area in the western United
States will have water shortages in the summer is the amount of
snowpack in the region’s mountains from the preceding winter that
lasts into the spring. Precipitation this past winter in Nevada was
far above normal, so that state is unlikely to experience water
shortages this coming summer.

Which of the following, if true, provides the most support for the conclusion above?
	Water use rates throughout the western United States have
	increased consistently over the past 10 years.  
	The ability of meteorologists to predict precipitation levels
	months in advance has improved greatly.  
	**Most of the precipitation in Nevada's mountains this winter fell
	as snow.**  
	Above normal snowpack in Nevada results in increased tourism from
	skiers and other winter sports enthusiasts.   
	In Nevada, factors other than the amount of snowpack have a small
    but measurable effect on the likelihood of a summer water
    shortage.  
	
**Conclusion**: Nevada unlikely to experience water shortage

**Evidence**: Precipitation this past winter in Nevada was far above normal.

**Additional evidence**: Amount of snowpack determines the water
shortages.

**Missing ling**: Precipitation is in fact snowpack

The insect known as the Asian citrus psyllid is a vector of citrus
greening disease. If it lays its eggs in the new leaves of an infected
citrus tree, then when the larvae become adults and fly off to feed on
other citrus trees, they can spread the disease to healthy
trees. Fortunately, scientists have definitively determined that a
small number of trees in the Los Angeles area constitute the only
infected trees in California. Thus, removing and burning those trees
will stop the disease from spreading into other areas of California.

Which of the following would most weaken the conclusion stated above? 
	Most diseases affecting agricultural crops in California are
	transmitted by insects.  
	Most citrus growers in California are not concerned about citrus
	greening disease.  
	A number of areas bordering California have substantial acreage of
	citrus orchards infected with citrus greening disease.  
	The bacterium that causes citrus greening disease is only spread
	by insects.   
	Florida has been successful in slowing the spread of citrus
	greening disease by using insecticides to eradicate the Asian
	citrus psyllid.   


**Conclusion**: Removing and burning those trees will stop the disease
from spreading into other areas of California

**Evidence**:  Spread through insects in bad trees. Bad trees in california.

**Additional Evidence**:

**Answer evidence**: Bad trees outside as well.

### Argument essay 1

> The following was written as a part of an application for a
> small-business loan by a group of developers in the city of Monroe.
>
> "A jazz music club in Monroe would be a tremendously profitable
> enterprise. Currently, the nearest jazz club is 65 miles away; thus,
> the proposed new jazz club in Monroe, the C-Note, would have the
> local market all to itself. Plus, jazz is extremely popular in
> Monroe: over 100,000 people attended Monroe's annual jazz festival
> last summer; several well-known jazz musicians live in Monroe; and
> the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is 'Jazz Nightly,' which
> airs every weeknight at 7 P.M. Finally, a nationwide study indicates
> that the typical jazz fan spends close to $1,000 per year on jazz
> entertainment."
>
> Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is
> needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would
> weaken or strengthen the argument.

**Conclusion**

Jazz music will be tremendously profitable enterprise if opened in Monroe

**Evidence**

1. Nearest Jazz club 65 miles
2. entire local market
3. Jazz is popular in monroe (100k people attended it last summer).
4. Jazz musicians live in Monroe
5. Radio program Jazz Nightly
6. Nationwide study 1k per year on Jazz entertainment

What needs to be evaluated and how the evidence weakens or enhances
the argument.

**Assumptions**

1. If a new Jazz club opened here, all of the people in the local
   vicinity would come here.
   
   Pricing, type of artists the club is able to afford 
   
2. How long will C-note have the local market all to itself? maybe
   there are other organizations doing the same thing    
   
3. 100k people came to the Jazz festival last summer, Perhaps they
   were all from different parts of the nation. Not indicative that
   people are part of the local market.
   
4. 1000 dollars people spend on "what is typical jazz fan"? of this
   1000 how many were spent at the jazz club vs say buying jazz music
   or instruments
   
5. 

### Argument 2

> According to a recent report, cheating among college and university
> students is on the rise. However, Groveton College has successfully
> reduced student cheating by adopting an honor code, which calls for
> students to agree not to cheat in their academic endeavors and to
> notify a faculty member if they suspect that others have
> cheated. Groveton's honor code replaced a system in which teachers
> closely monitored students; under that system, teachers reported an
> average of thirty cases of cheating per year. In the first year the
> honor code was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of
> cheating; five years later, this figure had dropped to
> fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey, a majority of Groveton
> students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor
> code in place than without. Thus, all colleges and universities
> should adopt honor codes similar to Groveton's in order to decrease
> cheating among students.
>
> Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to
> be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the
> argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how
> the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the
> recommendation.


**Conclusion**

All colleges should adopt GC codes should be adopted to reduce
cheating among students.

**Evidence**

1. 30 cases avg when GC teachers monitored

2. 21 cases year 1, year 5 --> 14 cases. 

3. What about year 2,3,4?

4. Survey students said less likely to cheat with than without honor system


**Assumptions**

1. All colleges are similar to GC

2. 30 cases avg with GC and 21 cases in year 1 and year5 without
   looking at population (whether it increased or decreased)
   
3. What is the guarentee that all cases are being reported?
   
4. It is easy to take correlation to caustion? no. It could also be
   that the decrease was because people didn't want to report.
   
5. Survey of students only compares without honor system, what about
   other systems?
   
6. Students are likely to say the truth in a survey about them cheating?


### Argument 3

> The following appeared as part of an article in a business magazine.
>
> "A recent study rating 300 male and female advertising executives
> according to the average number of hours they sleep per night showed
> an association between the amount of sleep the executives need and
> the success of their firms. Of the advertising firms studied, those
> whose executives reported needing no more than six hours of sleep
> per night had higher profit margins and faster growth. On the basis
> of this study, we recommend that businesses hire only people who
> need less than six hours of sleep per night."
>
> Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to
> be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the
> argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how
> the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the
> recommendation.

**Conclusion**

Questions! and how answering them would be useful.

1. On the basis of this study, we recommend that businesses hire only
people who need less than six hours of sleep per night.

**Evidence**

1. They sleep per night and they need is the same?

2. There could be other factors for their success like drive? pre
   conditions, age income level
   
3. It's only 300 statistically significant? 30 or more, don't do that!

4. males and females in advertising executives,
   extrapolation to all businesses, 
   
5. all people looks like the 300 people

6. People report truthfully?

7. Time not sleeping means they spend the rest on work?

8. Sleep only during night!

9. voluntary?


**Assumptions**


### Argument 4

> "Over the past two years, the number of shoppers in Central Plaza
> has been steadily decreasing while the popularity of skateboarding
> has increased dramatically. Many Central Plaza store owners believe
> that the decrease in their business is due to the number of
> skateboard users in the plaza. There has also been a dramatic
> increase in the amount of litter and vandalism throughout the
> plaza. Thus, we recommend that the city prohibit skateboarding in
> Central Plaza. If skateboarding is prohibited here, we predict that
> business in Central Plaza will return to its previously high
> levels."
>
> Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to
> be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely
> to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to
> these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

**Conclusion**

Ban skateboarding and then business will return to its previous high
levels (likely?) 2 years ago I guess..

**Assumptions**

1. Belief that decrease in business is due to number fo skateboard is
   not justified? It could also be because of some govt regulations,
   economy slump, or some campaign to buy less or people decided to
   spend their money elsewhere.
   
2. Litter and vandalism increase is related to these skateboarders

3. Prohibiting skateboarders will bring back to previous high?

4. Skateboarders are the only cause?

	4. it will not have any negative effects?

### Argument 5 full attempt

> The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a journal on
> environmental issues.
>
> "Over the past year, the Crust Copper Company (CCC) has purchased
> over 10,000 square miles of land in the tropical nation of West
> Fredonia. Mining copper on this land will inevitably result in
> pollution and, since West Fredonia is the home of several endangered
> animal species, in environmental disaster. But such disasters can be
> prevented if consumers simply refuse to purchase products that are

>
> Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated
> assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument
> depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the
> argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.


**Conclusions**

Consumers refusing to purchase products made by CCC unless the company
abandons it's mining plans


**Assumptions**

1. CCC is going to mine copper? maybe they wanted to marketting
   purposes, or maybe they wanted it for investment?

2. Mining copper will affect the endangered species? Perhaps where
   mining happens a lot of animals don't live close to the ores
   anyways, or perhaps the animals will move to another safe location
   near by. Without investigating into this, it 

3. "environmental disaster?"

4. Refusing to buy will result in CC abandoning the project

5. It is going to be possible to identify products in which CCC copper
   peple are willing 


**Introduction**

In the letter the editor the author assumes that if people stop
purchasing products from CCC, then the company will abandon it's
mining plans, thereby preventing things like environmental
disasters. However before this recommendation can be taken at face
value, there are 3 underlying assumptions that need more explanation
or evidence.

The author supports his argument with three assumptions that, if not
substantiated, dramatically weaken the persuav

**Body 1**

First of all, the author assumes that CCC will use the 10000 square
miles to mine copper. Perhaps it could be using this to help
animals. Or perhaps, it could be using this land for extracting wood
or promoting farming. If either of these scenarios is true, then the
author's contention that disaster can be avoided if consumers modify
their behavior does not hold water, might not be true.

Second of all, the author assumes that Mining copper in those lands
will endanger the species cause environmental pollution. Perhaps the
author is basing this claim off of older mining techniques rather than
the latest ones. And, even if that is not so, it might be the case
that the company is capable of cleaning up it's pollution there by not
causing "environmental disasters". If either of these scenarios are
true, then the authors claims would be unwarranted.

Finally, even if it is true that CCC will cause environmental disaster
 with the 1000 square miles it has bought, the author assumes that the
 consumers would know which of the products have ccc copper in
 them. Consider the case that the CCC copper is found in electric
 wires that are to be used in buildings. Such information about the
 manufacturer of the copper in electric wires is possibly going to be
 hard to ascertain. Or even worse, CCC copper might be obfuscating
 its' presence in products by using subsidiary companies which do the
 selling of their copper. If consumers are not even able to ascertain
 if CCC is in the product, then this makes the authors argument
 recoemmendation will do little to the stop the company's mining plans.


In conclusion, as it stands not, the conclusion is quite flawed due to
it's reliance on several unstated assumptions. The author needs to
provide evidence for intended use of the land, the "inevitable
environmental pollution", and if the consumers can even ascertain
which products have CCC's copper in them. This evidence will help with
the case the author is trying to make regarding

1. Encouraged to take courses based on interest rather than jobs

2. Agree or disagree

3. Reasoning

4. Give examples and show how your stance will be advantageous


**Introduction**

Hook, shift to prompt, thesis, outline.

For many students it is often a struggle to know what courses to take
and major to invest in. College Students have the difficult job of
whether to focus on their interests or to focus on courses that would
eventually lead to a job. The prompt suggests that college students
not labor on this for too long and simply choose a pt that confirms
closely with their interests rather than focusing on courses that seem
likely to lead to jobs.

In my opinion, I strongly agree with the prompt and argue that college
students should be encouraged to pursue subjects that interest them
for the following 3 reasons. 


<!-- Focus on disadvantages of focusing on jobs -->


1. Job market is shifting

2. 

3. 


To begin with the job market is shifting quite drastically every 20-40
years. Thus to choose a study based on job market alone might be
looking at the short term. There was a time when mechanical
engineering was the most high paid job and as a result was in high
demand. Over time this reduced and other professions such as software
have taken the lead. With Deep Learning progressing at such an
exponential pace, it is easily possible that many mechanical
engineering positions will become obsolete soon. 


We should not focus on job market, as it is short term and doesn't
last long. Today you might focus on jobs that prepare you for the near
term but the market keeps changing. In the past nuclear jobs were hot
and later mechanical and core engineering jobs took over and now
software and data is taking over. There is no reason to believe that a
new field will not take over in the future as the pattern from the
past is just too obvious. What this means for the supporting idea is
that focusing on job might be risky because you are not preparing
yourself for the long term. 



To begin with, I think college students should not focus on the job
market to decide which courses they are taking because the job market
is constantly changing. Focusing on such a market while making
decisions about what course to take, might be not be that useful. For
example...

Therefore focusing on just the job market seems like focusing on the
short term and this does not seem to be favoring the choosing job
thesis.

Further, even if we assume that the job market is dynamic and
unchanging, it still seems to make sense to choose based on interest
because focusing on interest will make you really good at a particular
study. Why this is important is because it can prepare you for the
long term. happiness



1. happiness

2. be very good at something, greatness always pays up, think
   of. focusing on your interests makes you really good at something
   and trains you for the long term. even if the job market changes,
   there are alwasy things that we are good at and can use in other
   areas. Look at the millions of mechanical engineers moving to the
   field of data science or software programming. Mechanical
   engineering gives skills in being analytical, thinking through a
   problem from scratch and this sort of basics allows people to adapt
   to the changing market with a bit of retraining. therefore,
   focusing on the interest seems to lead to more understanding of the
   subject matter and gaining portable skills to adapt to a different
   job market. 
   
   
Of course, some argue that the jobs are very competittive and thus
pursue practical paths is the way to go, i.e., focusing on the courses
for a job. However, isn't that a good reason to pursue courses based
on interest and that gives us a higher chance to be really good at
something and hence succeed?
