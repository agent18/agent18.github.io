With this post I would like to get a feel of the probability that it
is to be one day a green carder in the US.

## PR

Green card is the permanent residence card for people in the
US. Except voting you pretty much are able to do a lot of things.

## General info

**How many years it takes to get Green card?** 

10-15 years after application by your sponsor it appears when applying
after a H1B for an Indian. How my cousin got a green card is rather
unclear. L1 to green card (tbd) is not known.

**Which career stands a good chance of getting a job in the US?**

Not much dearth of jobs for students in CS.-[Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scope-for-jobs-in-USA-after-MS-in-CS). All opinions
state it should be possible. More research on this needs to be done. (tbd)

**Applying through family is a possibility?**

My brother will be a citizen in 20 years from now (I will be 46 by then) tops,
in the US. It appears that this route is far-fetched but still an
option. From that time he can apply for my green card it will take
12-16 years before we get an interview (I will be 58 by then). I can
know more later. I doubt this changes things. Appears to be too
far-fetched and almost useless?


## F-1 to H1B

The most common way to go the green card way is to start with a
masters.

>Program. F1 visas are by far the most common form of international
>student visa in the U.S. F1 students must maintain the minimum course
>load for full-time student status.-[Source](https://www.internationalstudent.com/study_usa/preparation/student-visa/)

Students coming to the US on an F-1 visa (usually) get a period of 12
months to work, called the OPT. This can be extended to upto 36 months
in total provided one's course has to do with STEM. 

Typically an MBA doesn't come under this, but can be hacked to come
under this by adding some courses related to STEM. [OPT FAQ](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ovis/updates/f1/optfaqs.html);
[Duration of OPT](https://www.quora.com/Does-MBA-come-under-STEM-What-is-the-OPT-period-for-STEM)

>of unemployment for a total of 150 days of unemployment over their
>entire post-completion OPT period. - [BerkleyOffice](https://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/students/employment/opt/unemployment)

So once on the OPT period one has a total of 90 days to be
unemployed. This is quite a small period.

In addition within an OPT one must work directly related to his degree
as given in the I-20 apparently.

During this period I guess we try to find a H1B sponsor. When fired on
an H1B Visa we have 60 days to find a job.

>However, on January 17, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security
>implemented a new rule that, among other things, extends a 60-day

When fired it is also possible to migrate to other visas.

**Other ways of getting an H1B or other visas?**

- Seeking a H1B from a non-profit employer
- Enrolling in an F1 CPT program
- Apply for O1 visa for highly skilled people
- J1 trainee or intern
[Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-of-a-masters-student-to-obtain-a-work-visa-in-the-US)


There are many other visas that can allow you to work in the US, and
hopefully provide you a path to the green colored
card-[quora-other-visas](https://www.quora.com/Is-H1B-visa-the-only-option-to-work-in-U-S#)

There is the O1 for highly skilled people in tech etc... There is the
L1 for people who can migrate within the same company but to the
US. H1B is also available for work at non-profits as well
(tbr). There is also the TN visa for citizens of Canada. 

**What are the chances of getting H1B through lottery**

Assuming we somehow do a STEM course and get the OPT Extension in
total of 36 months. 

>Timeline: Assuming a student graduates in May 17, Company can apply
>in April 17, 18,19,20. (Opt begins in June 17 and ends in June
>20). Application in April 17 depends on when the student gets a job
>and whether the company applies before joining.

>Grad graduating in Dec 16. The company can apply in April
>17,18,19. Opt starts in Jan 17 and ends in Jan 20)- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-an-F-1-student-can-apply-for-H1B-visa#)

Let's take the lower number of 3. 

There are 20k H1B's given for advanced degree people and 65k for
general quota people. Those who don't get in the 20k will also be
pooled in for the 65k H1B's. 

Catch is there are no statistics. But we know only two things that
there were 199k applicants in total for the H1B visa and that in total
there are about 85k H1B tickets. This means a 30% chance atleast for 3
years to try my luck with H1B. Some others on quora estimate it at
50-55% for masters engineers based on their availability (bias).

Things can change drastically in the future. Apparently in the OBAMA
administration there were already plans for increasing the total
number of H1B's/year.

## Going to Canada before coming to the US?

A Canadian PR costs about 5-6k$. It should take 6 months to prep and
upto 14 months to receive a decision or even more when applying via
the express entry program, due to gathering of all documents.

Apparently once you start working in Canada but then you loose a job
you get employment benefits (survival only I would think), but good to
know.

[how long to get PR in CANADA?](https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-it-take-to-get-Canadian-Permanent-Residence) [Unemployment benefits for PR in
CANADA](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-unemployment-benefits-for-Canada-PR-holder)

Apparently it is not easier to move to US. A TN VISA is for Canadian
citizens only and can be used to work in the US in 63 specific
occupational regions.In theory you cannot really apply for green
card. If that is the goal then H1B seems to be the way to go or
atleast better than TN. TN is not a dual intent visa - strictly based
on opinions on Quora and [here](http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/canadian-citizen-tn-status-get-green-card.html). It is possible to work in the US
but one can switch to other VISAS, mainly H1B. 

## Summary

Typical way to go to the US and get a green card is you start with an
F-1 then go on the OPT, get an H1B sponsor and then on your way to
green card. After studies assuming you get a job immediately and
somehow the lottery also works in your favour and you get a H1B, you
can then apply for your green card, which typically takes 10-15
years. Joing big companies like Google, Facebook to have a secure
enough future. 

Other possibilities if the H1B is too mainstream or you don get the
lottery exist, such as H1B through non-profit or the O1 visa
etc... Also there are routes to go to a Canadian citizenship (7-10
years in total), but right now it doesn't seem to make sense as we
will still be stuck on an H1B and the lottery process as the TN VISA
is not dual-intent.

## TODO 

  * [ ] L1 to Green Card the journey?
  * [ ] Best careers in US for getting a job?
  * [ ] H1B for non-profits? All Non-profits? Whats the fine print
