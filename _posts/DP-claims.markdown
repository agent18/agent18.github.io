Mr. Agent,

I recommend copying this into a Markdown file so that it is easier to

You've given concrete examples for [4], [5], [6], and [7].

How is "(Phones, Cars, clothing, supermarkets etc...)" an example for
(better position)[2]? They are (abstract) examples for industries, but
not for positions for humans. A "better position" would be, say,
"senior designer at <tech company>" or even "knowing senior-level guys
in six top companies in your industry, the way my boss <name> knows,
so that he can recommend others for jobs or get himself a new top
job" - that's career capital.

Right now, your examples are hiding within the example paragraph,
which makes it harder to notice when the examples are wrong (just like
the 175 bpm case).

You need to deal with each phrase on a separate line instead of
bunching up their examples in one paragraph. Look at the sample I'd
given:

> > P: modeling the (loads)[1] (accurately)[2] when (they)[3] (vary

>
> For [3], you think again about the load output values.
>
> For [4], you show how it was 107 kg five minutes ago and is now 208
> kg.

It's clear exactly what the example for [4] is.

> "learn about the industry" is vague?

I see you asking whether something is "vague" (the quotes were missing
around vague).

The test of concreteness is this: Does this label refer to at least
one example that can be thought of by an illiterate person?
(Equivalently, does it refer to at least one example that can be
thought of by a person who doesn't speak English or someone who
doesn't know about the field and its jargon?) Or does the label just
refer to some other labels?

"High-tech industries" is completely vague. Zero examples. A Dutch
person may not know what to think about when you say
"high-tech". (Maybe Dutch guys all speak English, in which case
substitute some Indian villager.) You may try to explain using other
labels: "it is an industry that deals with advanced technology and
semiconductors and software". He still doesn't know what "software"
is.

"Phone and tablets and laptops" are less vague because they are
abstract examples. You've unpacked "high-tech" into constituent
labels. But they are still labels! Again, the aforementioned,
hypothetical, ignorant Dutch person won't know what is a "tablet".

"iPhone and iPad and Macbook" are more concrete because they are
labels for which the above Dutch person can point to examples. Yes,
it's still not fully concrete because is it iPhone 5 or 6 or 17? Not
mentioned. Is it a golden iPhone 6 or a white iPhone 6? In fact, is it
the one that my friend has with serial number 76235 or the one your
friend has with serial number 262093? Not mentioned. But that's
fine. We don't need that level of detail. The difference in the
details we imagine between "high-tech industry" and "iPhone" is much
more than the difference in the details we imagine between "iPhone"
and "iPhone 6", at least for our current discussion. We would need
more details (i.e., iPhone 6S with upgrade 7.62 and 3 GB RAM or
whatever) if this were a product review article. (Imagine a product
review of the latest iPhone by a guy like me who's like "iPhone 7 or 8
or whatever - ah, it's all the same thing" - that's not what the
consumers want. They want to know which phone will give them greater
battery life when playing PUBG, which require concrete examples.)

Why does it matter if someone has a concrete example in their mind?
Because, then, they can test your statements on **at least one
example**. That is better than them just reading the labels and
nodding their head without checking it on any examples and thus not
finding if their current models were wrong. (It will also help them
remember it. Won't go into details here; coming soon.)

Suppose you say that "high-tech industries are becoming more and more
powerful in today's economy and have very high profits". With
"high-tech industries", the Dutch guy may not know whether or not
that's true. He can't test it. When you say "phone and laptops", the
Dutch guy may have a better idea of whether they are becoming more and
more powerful because he sees phones and laptops around, but he still
can't test it precisely. When you say "iPhone", he can test
immediately that Apple is one of the biggest companies in the world
and that it has high rates of profit. Yes, it's not a highly empirical
test, which would point to journal papers with exact percentage growth
rates over time and comparisons to other industries, but it's better
than just accepting the words as such. In short, one test done right
away is better than zero tests.

Why do we care about this dumbass, hypothetical Dutch guy who doesn't
understand English labels? Because when you're writing, **you** are
that dumbass, hypothetical Dutch guy. That means when you're writing
with just abstract labels or reading a book with abstract labels, you
probably won't think of a concrete example and you won't be able to
test the statements made. What then are your chances of writing
correct statements or learning correct models?

So, when you use a label or see a label, make sure you have at least
one example on which you can test statements about that label. How
much detail should that example have? Enough to judge the statements.

Test: "People in Venezuela are desperate for food." - vague or not?
Your answer: ___. Why?

Can you **test** the claim that "they are desperate for food"? How?
You probably don't know anybody from Venezuela.

Now imagine being told: "People in Venezuela go through trash to eat
rotting food." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2pjEYBhJSo) - can you
now test the claim that they "are desperate for food"? You bet. If
someone else says that "things in Venezuela are fine; it's just a
little trouble here and there", you can say "hell no" because you have
an example on which to test that statement. Nobody in their right mind
would call eating trash "a little trouble".

**That** is the power of one concrete example.

But, SPK, what about empirical evidence? What about journal papers?
What about scientific experiments? Don't we need that too? Calm down,
Doctor! Now's not the time for empirical evidence and scientific
experimentation. That comes later. <cue Dark Knight Rises beat>

> My colleagues at work helped me find jobs by giving me a list of

Good concrete example. (Why is it good and concrete? Because it allows
me to test the claim that "connections help you advance in your
career". They apparently do at least in one instance.)

I'm going to ask what do you mean by "people respect you just for

Very hard for me (and for you, when you're writing) to test each
example against its phrase when it's all mixed up. Please break it up
into one line per example as mentioned before.

Giving multiple examples is not the point of this practice. The point
is to test the statement using at least one example.

Here, it says roughly "some of the best ways to gain career capital
early on includes (a) working with highly-productive people and (b)
studying applied quantitative subjects".

Now, you need to find one example for (a) and one example for (b) and
check if each is a "best (or at least good) way to gain career capital
early on".

You worked with people you consider highly-productive (which is not an
objectively-measurable term like wealth or even seniority, but let's
run with it) and, yes, it seems to have helped you get your next
job. So, is that a yes or no for "gain career capital"? Hard to
tell. (This is why I don't like the term "career capital" - it's too
vague. How are you supposed to **test** if someone has high career
capital or low career capital?! What will the fucking Dutch guy say to
"career capital" apart from "wat"?)

Let's say that being able to find your next job more easily than your
peers who didn't know people like your boss is "career capital". So,
the statement (a) seems to pass the test of at least one concrete
example.

Similarly, the economics PhD you mentioned was able to find a
high-paying job more easily than a similarly-smart guy who studied
political science or philosophy. Good "career capital", I guess.

Aside: Why not just say that he will earn more over time or that he
will have more ability to recommend people for jobs? Both of those
terms are **far** more measurable than "career capital". Economists
routinely measure the impact of high-school dropout vs high-school
diploma vs some years of college but dropout vs undergrad degree vs
grad degree, in different fields, using the variable "median weekly
earnings" or "lifetime earnings". (One example:
https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/unemployment-rate-2-point-5-percent-for-college-grads-7-point-7-percent-for-high-school-dropouts-january-2017.htm). That
is the data I think about when people say "you should get a college
degree to get ahead in life" (at least in the US). I get a good idea
of some of what "get ahead in life" looks like: a median weekly wage
increase of $470. What data am I supposed to think about when they say
"study economics to get more career capital"? Anyway.

The two examples of your boss's recommendation and the economics PhD
guy are good-enough concrete examples to test the claim that (a) and
(b) help you gain this thing called "career capital". (Not happy about
that fucking term, but whatever.)

Of course, during your practice, you will cover every part of the
sentence they give. Every "or" or "and" is a new phrase you need to
test with a concrete example. So, in this statement:

> Working in any organization which has, or with any people who have,
> (a reputation for high performance e.g. top consultancy or
> technology firms)[1], or (any work with a great mentor or team)[2].

you would get an example for [1], i.e., working in any organization
that has a high reputation for performance, and an example for [2],
i.e., working with a great mentor or team. Then, you would test
whether they give you #!&$*@ "career capital".

(I may be wrong, but I have never been able to read through 80k's
articles on J-F-C "career capital" and other such vague terms. The
same goes for their "impact" on "major career-change decisions". How
much extra $$$ (the only thing that matters in earning to give) and
how much extra funding attracted (one of the key things when working
directly in an NGO along with efficiency of fund use) did they
directly cause? Those are measurable fucking things! You go to the
donations page and add up using a calculator how much did Dr. John
D. Economics-Guy donate every year. You ask GiveWell or AMF how much
did Jill J. Direct-Worker increase in funding or in efficiency.

But, SPK, those things are really hard to measure. And <objection 2>
and <objection 3>. Yeah! That's the point. How the fuck will you know
if you're doing any good at all if you don't measure the ultimate
"impact"? Yes, running 80k is probably better than earning and burning
your money on Ferraris, but is it better than some other EA career?
How do you know?

"But we measured precisely the number of 'major career-change
decisions'." - Ok. How many of those career changes would have
happened even without you? Maybe they came to you only to get some
more information? If so, you have to measure the marginal change -
from job A to slightly higher-paying job B - specifically because of
your advice. Otherwise, you're misleading yourself and others. Much
harder to mislead yourself if you measured "extra money donated
compared to similar guys who didn't come to 80k" - maybe some people
go to higher-paying jobs but don't donate - we all know that
happens. Ideally, you would control for the confounding variable of
"interest in EA" that makes them come to you in the first place (maybe
their interest makes them come to you and their interest is what makes
them donate; maybe you have little or nothing to do with it).

"But that's really hard to measure!" Yes, and that's the danger of
working in a delayed-feedback area like career counseling. A
restaurant or music band or product designer doesn't need to do this:
if the food sucks, the owner will find out in minutes; if the food
rocks, he will find out in tips within an hour and in increased
patronage within a week or two as people come back and bring
others. If the music rocks, you will have the crowd on their feet (if
they're already on their feet, you'll have them cheering like hell);
if not, you will have them silent and bored. In contrast, it's very
easy to go wrong when your feedback comes years or even decades
later. You have to hold yourself to a very high standard of
evidence. For example, liberal arts guys may have Ivy league degrees,
but they may end up working in coffee shops with $200k student loan
debt, whereas plumbers may have just a high-school diploma but earn a
median salary of $50k with zero debt. So, "get a college degree and
don't do manual labor" as advice (in the US) needs to be carefully
tested.

This is why certain people have this slogan "No _, no right to
talk". This is why they measured a certain Agent's progress, not by
his words, but by his donations. That is why they dismissed the vast
majority of smart LessWrong readers who read and understood but didn't
donate. You have to measure the ultimate goal ($$$), not some
intermediate variable (understanding and writing smart comments).

And, yes, people can ask "what have you achieved given that you're
being so nitpicky?". I haven't achieved practically anything. And
maybe I'm wrong about it all. Doesn't stop the previous statements
from being a valid criticism.

</rant>)

The above is an example of concrete thinking as done by me. It shows
the second skill of concrete thinking: knowing **how to test** whether
a label applies or doesn't apply. We all know how to check if someone
earns more (check their pay slips - if the number has gone up, they
earn more; else, they earn less). We know how to check if someone has
scored more runs (count the number of runs over all their
matches). But do we know how to check if Dhoni is a "better finisher"
than Michael Bevan? How the fuck do you test that? One may have more
runs than the other, while the other has a better run rate, but one
has won more matches, but the other won the fucking World Cup
final. That is what we call a vague label. Contrast that to "mass" - a
physicist knows exactly what you mean by it - whatever number you get
on a precisely-defined instrument. Even something that initially
sounds vague like "human-development index" is fine, as long as they
specify exactly how to measure it using life expectancy at birth,
education index, and per capita purchasing power (with each of these
terms being precisely defined in turn). More on how to taboo later.

Anyway, back to the topic, the first skill of concrete thinking =
testing statements with at least one example.

It's good that you're imagining concrete examples like the failing
filter case. That's step one. Now, did it serve the purpose? What
purpose? The T-word. What statement were you testing?

it.

That is super-abstract! How can you tell? Ask the Dutch guy. Can he
test a claim against this mathematical example? Suppose someone says
"consulting experienced guys in your field will help your
decision-making", can he test that claim using this example?

But suppose, instead, that your example for decision-making was that
you had to choose between a job in <company A> with less salary but
better promotion prospects than <company B>. Now, he could test the
claim about "consulting experienced guys" - yeah, they could tell you
roughly how much difference the extra promotion prospects would make
(assuming he had a concrete example for "experienced guys", but we can
assume that for our purposes). And he would reject the claim that
"meditation for 20 minutes would help your decision-making" by saying
that he really doesn't have even one example for it as he doesn't see
how that will help him decide between extra salary and extra promotion
prospects. He's not saying the claim is false; he's just saying that
he hasn't seen a single example for it, let alone a ton of empirical
evidence.

And if you ask me "do you think people are so stupid that they will
use words for which they don't have even a single example, let alone a
ton of empirical evidence?", I will hope to God that you have good
luck in answering that question yourself.

In other words, a concrete example is "good" (for our purposes) if it
helps you test claims that you see. (See how I gave a way to test
whether the label "good concrete example" applies to a given
situation? That is an example of taboo. Coming soon.)

Get a concrete example and test the claim:

> (A job will be best for learning)[1] when (you are pushed to
> improve)[2] and (get lots of feedback from mentors)[3].

The claim is [1].

An example for [2] is your friend who apparently was pushed to
improve. It's not clear if the claim is that you need both [2] and [3]
to get [1] or if they will independently add to [1].

An example for [3] is again your friend.

Now test the claim. You can see that, yes, he apparently did learn a
lot. But is it "best for learning"? How the fuck do you test that
claim? What evidence do they have for that? That would involve
comparing against all other types of jobs for learning and ensuring
that a job that gives [2] and [3] is "best". That, in my opinion, is
poor writing. But what do I know?

Contrast that to saying that you will learn more at such a job even if
you earn less. You can think of concrete examples for that, such as
friends who work for low salaries at startups but learn a fuckton
about distributed systems and reproducible builds because they have to
do it all by themselves. (Again, this is far from an empirical study
of the entire industry, but one test > zero tests. And one test that
you do right away > a hundred perfect tests that you never do.) If
some guy says that startup jobs are useless because they pay much
lower than big company jobs, what can you do? You can test it
instantly against the concrete example you have - nope, a friend
learned a lot and went on to better jobs because of his better skills
even though the startup paid less.

Can you feel the difference between just reading the statement "A job
will be best for learning when you are pushed to improve and get lots
of feedback from mentors" and sort of agreeing with the general idea
(it sounds reasonable after all) versus testing it against an actual
example? Did you notice the gaping flaw in the claim "best for
learning"? That is the sort of thing I claim you are likely to see
only when you test against a concrete example. (An example for
**this** claim is the episode above, where you had missed it when not
testing the claim against an example and where you could see it after
I pointed out a concrete test.)

You successfully tested the claim that "people you hang out with can
influence you" [A] with the above concrete example. Does it mean it's
true forever and everywhere? No. But it's better than some random-ass,
untested claim. [B]

<filler>

<filler>

<filler>

<filler>

Did you think of some "random-ass, untested claim" that is worse than
the tested claim above? If so, good. If not, why did you accept the
previous sentence and keep reading ahead?

A simple "random-ass, untested claim" is that "A job will be best for
learning when you are pushed to improve and get lots of feedback from
mentors" [C]. Is it random-ass and accepted without being tested? Yes,
we saw that above. (The fact that it is random-ass is left as an
exercise for the reader.) Does my claim [B] pass the test that "[A] is
better than some random-ass, untested claim"? Well, [C] turns out to
be very hard to test and almost certainly wrong. [A] passes at least
one example. So, yeah, I would say [A] is better than [C] and
therefore my claim [B] is supported by at least one concrete
example. You don't need to get a perfect concrete example. Any example
will do.

You tested the claim that it is "important to make connections" by
checking if your connections helped you in some important way.

The claim is [2] (along with [3], [4], [5], and [6]). You have to test
that the claim passes for at least one example for [1].

Unfortunately, [1] = wanting to gain "career capital" early in your
career, which is God-knows-what. The Dutch guy who has never heard of
the term "career capital", just like 99% of the Earth's population,
just throws up his hand and says that he is simply not able to think
of a concrete example for that.

Anyway, if [1] were such that you could get a concrete example for it,
you would do that and check if there is at least somebody who wanted
to gain "career capital" early in his career and therefore went for
consulting [3], somebody who wanted that and therefore went for
software engineering [4], and somebody who was like that and therefore
went for tech entrepreneurship [5]. (If they don't have a concrete
example of someone who wanted to gain "career capital" early in his
career and therefore went for "tech entrepreneurship", why did they
mention it?)

Next, you would test if it is indeed "rarely the best early career
options if..." [6] by checking if each of the above three examples are
"rarely the best early career options". Again, that's hard to test
because you have to show some career option that is much "better" than
the ones above (along which dimension? Money? Promotion prospects?
#!&$*@ "Career capital"? Progress along our "top problem areas"? Hard
to say, but it wasn't I who wrote that sentence). It would be much
easier to test if their claim was that it would lead to lower lifetime
earnings than someone who did something else. Then, you could get the
lifetime earnings for [4] and the lifetime earnings for the
alternative and check if the former is lower. See how much clearer
that is?

They should give at least one example of people who "entered a
priority path directly" and did better than people who went into
software engineering, etc. (That is what will support their claim that
people "should focus" on these paths.) They need another example for
"going to graduate school" and doing better than those who went
directly into software engineering.

That is a circular definition. How do you define "flexible career
capital"? It means having a large number of career paths in the
future. Ok. What is the benefit of "flexible career capital"? Well, it
allows you to have a large number of career paths in the
future. Wow. That's great. We should get more "flexible career
capital".

You can replace "flexible career capital" with "have a lot of career
options" and nothing will change. Calling it "flexible career capital"
adds nothing.

## Technical Stuff

The fact that you struggled with the technical stuff is good. What you
need to focus on are your failures.

Firstly, give examples one per line as mentioned before.

The main claim is [5]. You need to find a concrete example of [1] and
[3] and show that [1] "provides a better understanding" than [3].

Similarly, you will show that the better understanding is because [1]
is based on [4].

A side claim is [2], saying that [1] and [2] differ in that [1] is
based on the concepts of energy and work and [2] is not. Test that
claim using the concrete examples for [1] and [2].

During practice, you will be copy-pasting the example, but when
reading, you would just think about an example for [1] and [2]. If you
can't, do you really understand the claim that [1] provides a better
understanding of mechanical phenomena than [2]?

Yes, this is a perfectly acceptable test of the claim that [1] leads
to "better understanding" than [2]. We can clearly see the effect of
changing F on k when using [1] but not so in [2].

Giving a generic example for approximate numerical methods is fine
when talking about that phrase in isolation. But, here, our aim is to
check if the concrete example that we are using to test the sentence
matches the phrase "approximate numerical method":

> It (gives rise)[1] to (approximate numerical methods)[2] for the
> solution of both (discrete)[3] and (continuous systems)[4] in the
> (most natural manner)[5].

The claim is that [3] gives rise to [2] while also satisfying [5].

So, whatever concrete example you use for [3] should "give rise to"
something that satisfies the test of being an "approximate numerical
method".

On top of that, the solution for [3] should do so in the "most natural
manner" [5] (whatever that means; for our purposes, we can mark that
as an ambiguous phrase and accept something that needs just two
equations instead of six).

You should do the same with a concrete example for [4]. Note that I
split "discrete and continuous" into two phrases because they are
separated by an "and". So, you will need to test the claim [1] using
one example for each.

Good teachers will always give a concrete example with every term they
use so that students can use that to test what they learn. For
example, PG doesn't just say that a "schlep" is something tedious. He
gives you a concrete example using Stripe and then tests his claim
that "schlep blindness" hides many valuable startup ideas by walking
through how thousands of people ignored it in favour of recipe sites
and how Stripe went ahead despite all the obvious schleps involved.

You need to latch on to these concrete examples so that you can test
everything they say after that point. This is also called a "running
example" - some example against which you can test most or all of the
claims that an author makes in the rest of a chapter.

Let's take another technical statement:

> Principle of virtual work (7)
>
> Let us consider a (particle of mass m, submitted to a force field X
> of components Xi in an inertial frame)[1]. The (dynamic equilibrium
> of the particle)[2] (can be expressed in d'Alembert's form)[3]

The claim is that, given an example of [1], its dynamic equilibrium
[2] can be expressed in d'Alembert's form (whatever that means). You
need to test that with one example of [1]. Get an example of something
of mass m that is submitted to a force field, etc. Then, get its
dynamic equilibrium and show that it matches d'Alembert's form. If so,
then that claim passes for at least one example.

This section was worse than last time, but that's good news. It means
there's a lot of room for aggressive expansion. This is exactly the
kind of thing you need to focus more heavily on from now on:

I don't understand what you mean by "I didn't understand this
part". Given that concrete thinking means breaking a sentence into a
claim and getting at least one concrete example to test that sentence,
you have to specify where you failed. Were you not able to identify
the claim? Were you not able to come up with one example for a
particle that matched the given requirements? Lastly, were you not
able to test whether the claim passed for that example? Narrow down
your lack of "understanding".

Good job on making the time to practice!

It took me around 5.5 hours to explain my theory of concrete thinking
above and review the rest of the stuff. It's worth it. [SST]

Mission #7: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
identify claims and get concrete examples to test them.

Primary target: The same work-related document as last time that you
need to understand thoroughly but currently don't. For each sentence,
identify the claim, break up any "or" and "and" into separate phrases,
get a concrete example for each, and test whether the claim is true
for that concrete example.

If the author provides a running example, hold on to it for dear life
and use it throughout that section or chapter. (When I said "running
example", did you think of Stripe and "schlep blindness" and did you
imagine going through PG's essay with that in mind? SS should have
T-ed.)

If you don't "understand" something, specify exactly on which part you
failed.
