https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_sidebar.asp shows how
to add side bar. And also shows what to add to the layout. This
generates a similar page as shown in the link


https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_sidebar_navigation.html
suggests to use some plugin, what is a plugin how to instlal it?


https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/separate-table-of-content/242 this page
informs that you cannot use "jekyll-toc" plugin! :(


Allejo
https://allejo.io/blog/a-jekyll-toc-without-plugins-or-javascript/ 

seems to be saying the same thing


https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc this seems to be the solution to
be implemented..


### implementing it

MEga fail

tried allejo but had problebs with css itself. css wont get rendered
or css being overridden somewhere somehow. Need to make a stack
question out of it!
