## What is expected

We are examining **guided self-help** as a potential intervention for
this year's charity ideas. Guided self-help can be used to target many
different psychiatric disorders or other problems such as chronic
pain. It can involve a variety of therapy techniques; we are most
interested in examining bibliotherapy. Your instructions are as
follows:

1.  Familiarize yourself with **bibliotherapy** as a form of guided
    self-help by reading sources you see as relevant.

2.  Use our informed consideration methodology ([link](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/informed-consideration.html#ICcrucialconsiderations)) to create a
    list of crucial considerations (CC) that you think should be
    examined before recommending this charity idea.

3.  Research the CC you think is most important.

## What is guided-bibliotherapy

**Bibliotherapy (BT)**: Use of books as treatment of mental or
psychological disorders ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotherapy)).

**[Guided BT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550243)**: Bibliotherapy is a form of guided self-help. The
patient works through a structured book, independently from the
doctor. The role of the doctor is to support and motivate the patient
as they continue through the book and to help clarify any questions or
concerns the patient may have.

## CC

**Entry question**: Should we start our own intervention charity based
on bibliotherapy? What are the significant considerations that could
affect the initiation or continuation of the intervention.

1. Is there evidence of **intervention working**? (RCTs or surveys or
   studies)
	   
	   - strength of evidence (RCTs surveys studies)
	   - number of people in the evidence
	   - how weak or strong is the evidence
	   - number of people in the data
	   - how is the data chosen (random) (refer SS)
	   - how is the data allocated in the RCT (refer SS)

2. Is there evidence of the intervention **not working**?
   what are they? Criticism etc...
   
   Is bibliotherapy hocus pocus (how is the material chosen --> seems
   vague)
   
   Are scientists devided on this? how so?
 
 
3. **Uncertainties**?

   Are there difficulties in reaching people with the intervention?
    
   What sort of people is this supposed for? the 96% or 50% who didn't
   get help.
   

3. **Neglectedness**? Resources allocated to this intervention
   already?
   
   Are there things missing like funding or awareness or other things
   that we can improve to reach BT to everybody?
	
   Is someone else performing the intervention? What issues do they
   have? Should we fund them or help them scale up or start a new
   charity?
   
   Would it be possible for a charity to even pick it up? How would
   that look like?

6. **Scale** of impact in DALYs or atleast number of people (cea?) that
   could potentially be effected by the intervention?

	What sort of illnesses is it for (low mood anxiety and stress?),
	how many people can it actually help? 

    > In the 1980s and early 1990s, bibliotherapy was a widely used but
    > poorly researched therapeutic model. However, numerous randomized
    > controlled trials (RCTs) have documented the positive effects of
    > bibliotherapy for clinical conditions such as deliberate self-harm,
    > obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and bulimia nervosa and
    > insomnia. Research also supports bibliotherapy as an intervention for
    > a wide array of psychological issues including emotional disorders,
    > alcohol addiction, and sexual dysfunction. -wiki

	What sort of ages is it for?
	
	What countries would have max impact and how many people?
	
	Actual people possible to improve (96%)? Is it all people with
    mental illness or just the people who have MNSS and are seeking
    help (50%).

7. **General:** 

	How does the intervention work?
	
	Costs incurred by affected person in low-income countries (aka
    without insurance?) or does the non-profit pay.
	
8. What sort of diseases can it cure? 

	What is population of that?
	
	Which tract to use? Affective or CBT?
	
9. Where does BT feature?

	
    > low rates of recognition of their problem by people with
    > depression, low rates of consultation by people who do recognise
    > that they have such a mental illness, barriers to access
    > treatment37 and poor treatment adequacy. --- Undertreatment of
    > people
	
10. How long does the effects last? 

## Considerations that could significantly affect an intervention

Whether interventions work or not

Are there any uncertainties

Not sure. I would ideally like to investigate 3 of them asap...

I feel scale might be for a CEA. neglectedness can add value here
informing what part of the intervention we should could focus on and
if there are ways to do that? Also anti-intervention seems most
useful, atleast you check out the issues with it?

So I guess I will start with viewing the evidence and look at the
criticism.


So I think I am going with looking into the studies and looking for
criticism and if time permits strength and uncertainties will be
investigated.

Let's do a 5 minute study on each of them?

Am I looking for types of MNSS this is going to be useful for? no?
just what are the cases where it doens't work? and work? and where are
the uncertainties?

## Report

### Wiki main RCT article

This wiki source seems to be someone personal document collection and
refering to "studies" based on results such as "brilliant". I don't see
any statistics of how many said X and Y. Main article for RCT's. Not
convinced at all. IF several people go into a study and you don't
report the outcome fully then how are we to
judge. https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/mental-health-services/powerofwords/patientsbibliotherapy.pdf

### RCT of Carers with First-episode Psychosis in adjunct

[This paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3796072/) titled, "A Randomized Controlled Trial of
Bibliotherapy for Carers of Young People With First-Episode
Psychosis", presents effects of Problem Solving Bibliotherapy
Intervention (PSBI) vs treatment as usual (TAU) while used as an
adjunct to "gold standard support from specialist early intervention
FEP services in Melbourne, Australia"

**Output dimensions**: "increases
in positive personal experiences";  based on ECI questionnaire.

**Conclusions**: Self-Directed PSBI had more favorable experience of caring than
those receiving TAU over both follow-up time points (6week -->
p=0.016, 16 weeks --> p=0.036).

**Data**: 124 carers; assesed at baseline, 6-week, 16-week follow-up.

**Note:** Unsure what the ECI questionnaire outputs exactly (new to
this). There seem to be more outputs and each hypothesis tested. For
now I move on, but it is something I need to look into just as a
sanity check and not believe the paper on face value.

### RCT somatic symptom disorder and illness anxiety

[This paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/AC44F297D8A660A0D99D0E0DA4370340/S0007125000245455a.pdf/exposurebased_cognitivebehavioural_therapy_via_the_internet_and_as_bibliotherapy_for_somatic_symptom_disorder_and_illness_anxiety_disorder_randomised_controlled_trial.pdf) titled, "Exposure-based cognitive-behavioural therapy
via the internet and as bibliotherapy for somatic symptom disorder and
illness anxiety disorder: randomised controlled trial." presents the
value of ICBTs, U-ICBTs (unguided ICBTs) and U-BTs (unguided BT) along side

**Output dimension**: Health Anxiety Inventory

**Conclusion**: Significantly larger proportion of participants in all
treatments were clinically significantly improved compared with those
in the control condition (p=0.0001). There was no significant
different between the three treatment arms (p=0.46--0.72).

**Data**: 132 participants; assesed at pre-treatment, post-treatment
and 6 month follow-up.

### RCT Chronic pain

[This paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24740527.2019.1678113) titled, A randomized controlled trial evaluating the
effectiveness of an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)–based
bibliotherapy intervention among adults living with chronic pain,
presents 8 week self administered psychological intervention (based on
ACT) with minimal therapeutic contact to manage Chronic pain.

**Output dimension**: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)

**Data**: 230 induviduals; assesed at pretest, posttest and 3 months post intervention.

### RCT anxiety and depression in adults

[This paper](https://www.dovepress.com/comparative-efficacy-and-acceptability-of-bibliotherapy-for-depression-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-NDT) titled, "Comparative efficacy and acceptability of
bibliotherapy for depression and anxiety disorders in children and
adolescents: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials", presents
a summary of many RCTs in one place. 

**Output dimensions**: They look at two output dimensions, Efficacy
and Acceptability to inform the results of their meta analysis.

**Conclusion**: BT was *statistically more effective* than the control
conditions in reducing symptoms of depression or anxiety (Overall
pooled estimate p=0.006). BT did not have *statistically significant
all-cause-discontinuations (after-treatment)* as compared with the control
(p=0.09).

**Data**: Total patients pooled from all studies 979. Data corresponds
to children less than 18 years of age at the time of enrollment into
study. Length of treatment 4-12 weeks. Info on the different studies
pooled is found [here](https://www.dovepress.com/cr_data/article_fulltext/s152000/152747/img/NDT-152747-T01.png).

**Note about age**: 

- BT vs control in  including adolescent patients --> p=0.02 (significant)
- BT vs control in studies including children --> p:0.18 (Not significant)


### Summary

I have come across several RCTs on BT. Overall from the RCTs I saw, it
looks like
