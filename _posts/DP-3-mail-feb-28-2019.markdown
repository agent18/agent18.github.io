Mr. Agent,

Great job on continuously attacking every mission. Sad that you didn't
complete this mission. Please ensure target demolition on future
missions.

You need to break down the "phrase" even further. Instead of "designed
specifically to improve performance", which has two main parts, make
it "designed specifically" and "improve performance". That way, for
"improve performance", you get to know exactly what you mean by
"performance".

> P: it's highly demanding mentally
>
> E: It is quite a mental load to practice. You are physically tired

You said "highly demanding mentally" but you spoke about "physically
tired". I can't see an example for "mental tiredness". That's why it's
important to break it down.

I still don't see anything "mental".

> P: Hopefully gets me to amazing levels
>
> E: amazing levels like that of my peers (in a year or two)

Which part of that was **concrete**? I don't know anything about those
"peers". Contrast that to "landing 3-pointers more than 60% of the
time".

But, STM, how can anyone notice those kinds of details? It's too vague
and hard to see. It's an "art", Mr. White.

Personal story: Guy in the gym had joined around the same time as
me. Within a couple of months, he was noticeably more buff than I was
even though we both went six days a week. What's up with that? Decided
to pair up with him on a biceps workout. "We'll learn that both of us
have basically the same amount of muscle. Maybe it's not as visible
for me because of fat or height or whatever." -- Anonymous III, at the
start of the biceps workout.

Within three sets, I was **finished**. This guy pushed himself like a
motherfucker. Maximum weights on the barbell for curls and maximum
number of reps even when his face was red and he was grunting and so
on. Next to him, my workouts were like a stroll in the park. I thought
maybe he overdid it today and we're going take a break. Nope. Next
exercise - with just as much intensity. Fuck me. There was a reason
why he had put on more muscle. And once he and I did the same thing
side by side, the difference was obvious.

Moral of the story: Find out exactly in which ways they are
"better". How? Dot dot dot.

> P: this will do jack shit to your performance
>
> E: You will NEVER be better than your peers.

I'm too dumb to understand this sentence, especially when there is no
concrete example for miles. Especially taxing on my brain are the
words "be better" and "peers".

> P: it can be repeated a lot
>
> E: The pathetic practice I had designed earlier seriously missed out

Great concrete example. You can just say "a lot" = "100 times, not
just 20 times". No need to write long sentences.

> P: feedback on results is continuously available

> or not.

Again, chunk it up. What does "feedback on results" look like? Say,
shooting percentage. (Why not also measure categories like "missed
completely" and "hit the rim" and "nothing but net"? Fine-grained
feedback as opposed to "in" and "out".)

Next, what does "continuously available" look like? Maybe you're
counting the last 10 balls and the success percentage therein. This is
continuous, as opposed to "go home and log it after taking a shower
and maybe having dinner", which is the exact opposite of "continuously
available".

Basically, you should be able to point from the abstract phrase
"feedback on results" to the concrete example "percentage of last 10
balls". Currently, that's hard to do because your example talks about
multiple phrases.

> P: work on them intently
>
> E: Kobe Bryant the legend who quits practicing only after he makes
> 400 shots (around 3 hrs of only shooting). Legend!

Citation needed. The two articles don't mention him quitting practice
in general only after he makes 400 shots.

This was not Kobe:

> "I'm going to get there at 3 o'clock and I'm going to make sure I
> get 400 made shots," Williams said, but when Kobe was already on the

>
> -- [](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/kobe-bryant-story-jay-williams-playoff-workout/2/)

No evidence that the following was more than a one-time incident:

> a.m. to 11 a.m., refusing to leave the gym until he made 800 shots.

> P: see a couple of issues and isolate each one of them

This should have been two separate phrases.

> P: While learning it is good to be in the zone where we are just
> beyond our comfort zone; which makes us stretch our abilities; it is

This should have been:

> P: (While learning) it is (good) to be in the (zone where we are
> just beyond) (our comfort zone); which (makes us) (stretch our
> abilities); it is (quite motivating) instead of being a (daunting
> task) to approach...

"I counted eight, Mr. Wayne."

Why break it up? Because you haven't given an example for "quite
motivating" and, what's worse, you haven't noticed. You showed that
175 bpm would be daunting, but you didn't mention whether you
succeeded in going at 165 bpm. If you didn't, it's not an example that
actually happened (similar to the poem mentioned in the introduction).

> P: Isolation of the specific space where you need to improve is key

should be

> P: (Isolation)[1] of the (specific space where you need to
> improve)[2] is (key)[3]

My answer: Ball buried in sand is for [2], Woods burying balls on
purpose is for [1], and the fact that he can hit sand balls whereas
others suck balls is to show [3].

Notice how it's easy to give just one example for one part of a long
sentence and mislead yourself into thinking that you've got the whole
sentence covered. Check your response:

> E: One of the important aspects of "critical thinking" is to see all
> words as clear cut examples and not as vague sentences. Identifying
> where examples are needed and providing them is the skill

Looks good, on the face of it. After all, it's got 34 words. But the
only example it has is "see all words as clear cut examples and not as
vague sentences", which is for [2] (and is not all that concrete). You
haven't shown how you would isolate it [1] or why it is key
[3]. You've just stated again that it is "one of the important
aspects", which is a high-level rephrasing of [3] but not a concrete
example.

And is it a coincidence that the very thing you feel confused about
when it comes to "critical thinking" is exactly how important it is
[3] and how to practice it [1]? You're a detective now, son.

> P: modeling the loads accurately when they vary with time

should be

> P: modeling the (loads)[1] (accurately)[2] when (they)[3] (vary with
> time)[4]

For [1], you can imagine the graph or output of weight going from 107
kg and 125 kg (or whatever).

For [2], you need to show what inaccurate load modeling looks like
(maybe, you took 360 measurements per minute), show what accurate load
modeling looks like (maybe you now take 720 measurements per minute),
and then show that it is indeed worthy of the adjective "accurate"
(maybe the error magnitude goes down).

For [3], you think again about the load output values.

For [4], you show how it was 107 kg five minutes ago and is now 208
kg.

Here's how I would have approached the abstract (for deliberate
practice):

> Abstract - This paper presents a (new)[1] (paradigm)[2] for design
> of (mechanical components)[3] that are subjected to (dynamic)[4]
> (loading)[5] in their (regular operation)[6].

For [2], what was the existing "paradigm"? What does a "paradigm" look
like? Is it a set of equations or a function for doing something? Once
you can show the existing "paradigm", you can then write your new
"paradigm" in a similar format.

I bet that, when you wrote this, you probably didn't have a clear
example of a "paradigm".

For [1], how is it "new"? Show yourself the differences from the
existing "paradigm". Maybe the equation uses x^3 of x^2. That is a
specific new change.

For [3], think of the actual, concrete components by name. Are they
three parts "Foo137", "Bar7.0", and "Baz 9A44" joined together?

For [5], think of the weight output in the simulator or in some
instrument.

For [4], show how your adjective "dynamic" is justified. Why isn't it
called just "loading"? What made you add the "dynamic" to it? Why not
"static"? Maybe this involves the weight output changing over minutes.

For [6], show (or think about, when writing the paper) what "regular
operation" looks like. For example, the regular operation of a car is
to have people sit inside, get the engine started, run at 40 mph for
half an hour or so, with a couple of stops, and stay off till
evening. Abnormal operation would be taking your sedan on an
off-terrain path or driving at 150 mph for three hours straight. Your
description doesn't have to be incredibly detailed, but it has to be
something concrete you can refer to every time you use the word
"regular operation".

> P: detailed analysis of the mass distribution, strength and loading
> of components
>
> E: for example using Finite Element Methods

That is not an example. An example would be some paper you read "Foo:
Finite Element Method applied to Table Fan Components" (2016) or some
project you did. "For example using Finite Element Method" is just
hand-wavy, wishful thinking (unless you have an example in mind). Here
are some questions that you would be able to answer if you had a
concrete example: How many more lines of code or equations would it
take? How much longer would that simulation run? Which parts are you
not sure about how to implement? You won't be able to answer these
questions empirically if you just say "use Finite Element Methods".

> P: dynamic loads are comparable/greater than the static loads on a
> component
>
> E: Dynamic loads are greater than static loads in Gas Turbines and

This **is** an example. Kudos on the 4000 rpm. However, it is an
example only for the component. You haven't given concrete examples
for "dynamic loads" or "static loads". What are their actual values?
3000 kg (or whatever)?

> P: This method (FOS method) is not guaranteed to produce the best

Citation (and concrete example) needed. If you've heard about before,
you should have a ready example, either from some paper or some
textbook or your own project. I expect something like "when Toyota did
this to their engine in 2009, it broke within a few thousand test
runs". If you don't really have an example, what do you think you know
and how do you think you know it?

> P: it is customary to come up with a design based on the available
> knowledge of load
>
> E: We set the inertial terms to 0 and this makes computation faster

Again, that is not an example. An example looks like this: In the five
projects in our company (in your mind, you can recall their names A to
E) where experienced engineers designed load systems, they set the
inertial terms to 0, which makes computation faster (by 5 hours on
average) and so on.

Will you always know the stats like 5 hours? Not necessarily, but if
it is a key point in your argument, you should.

> P: coupled nature of these
>
> E: if you increase mass of the part the inertia increases, if the
> inertia increases loads increase, if the loads increase the
> dimensions increase/change, which have an effect on the mass

Again, that is theory, not a concrete example. Every single part of
your "E" is abstract: "increase mass" (by how much?), "part" (name?),
"inertia" (what was the value?), "increases" (by how much?). Show an
example where increasing one increases the other. (You won't write it
in the paper; this is for your practice.) If you can't think of a
concrete example offhand, do you really understand the concept?

> (Usually), in the (analysis of a connecting rod), its mass is
> substituted for by an (equivalent system of concentrated masses)[1].

Usually? Where? In experiments done by kids? By adults? Penguins?
Experts?

How often? 30% of the time? How do you know?

> analysis of a connecting rod

Concrete example, please, either from your project or from some
textbook.

> P: huge computer models
>
> E: "Models using Finite Element Methods": For the IC engine

Good that you mentioned the time taken (1 hour) to justify
"huge". However, we don't see a concrete example for "huge computer
model" that uses Finite Element Methods. Just saying the abstract
method isn't enough. Maybe point to something from your company (in
your own mind) or some famous open-source model.

> P: kinetostatic analysis model
>
> E: crank is assumed to have a constant speed.

Again, a theoretical sentence. Whose crank? At what speed?

* * * * *

In short, please avoid using a term like "kinetostatic analysis model"
or "paradigm" or "coupled nature" without a concrete example in mind.

Mission #6: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, would be to
clarify material that genuinely confuses you. (Did your spider-sense
start tingling for the last two phrases? It should have.)

Primary target: Some work-related document that you need to understand
thoroughly but currently don't. Take it apart almost word-by-word and
provide a *concrete* example for each one.

For example, "habeas corpus" sounds like a confusing legal term. But
once I've seen an example for it
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus#Examples), I know it
pretty well and can follow along when I hear it in another case. Even
somebody who has no idea of the jargon can understand by looking at
the concrete example. Note that the theoretical definition ("Habeas
corpus is a recourse in law through which a person can report an
unlawful detention or imprisonment to a court and request that the
court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to
bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is
lawful.") is not good enough - it's not a concrete example.

Secondary target: Some non-technical document that you want to
understand thoroughly but currently don't.

Reps: 200.

Success criteria: Does it feel less confusing? Does it now feel
crystal-clear? (<spider-sense tingling>)

Bro,

a) I think it is a lot of work looking at 20 to 25 hrs time ( 5 hrs
per day * 5 days), i.e., re-writing, finding sources, re-reading and
breaking down 200 sentences. I didn't want to bite more than I can
chew! But, (we know from science that) we should use history to
identify how long a task will take and not by the number of things
there are to do. So...

Last essay I did was based on a 3k word article, so roughly 300
sentences across ~2 main dimensions. This part of DP took ~7 hrs
[1]. Keeping a factor of safety of 2 (for errors in considering the
wrong avg. number of words in a sentence, for errors in the word count
of the article, to account for deviations in time/sentence as this
task is a bit different now), the DP part shall take about 9 hrs for
200 sentences! And I should have the rest of the time (15 hrs) for
other things. Looks ok!

Here is a video of Tiger Woods stopping mid-shot unable to focus
because of the shadow of a bird flying behind him. Here is him
stopping mid-shot so many times over his career, informing us that,

That's what I'm talking about. You can feel the difference in clarity
between that and the example from the mission statement ("You run
scenarios in your mind where you are verbally battling with
them"). Also, it helped that the commentators themselves showed us how
difficult it was as they kept gushing "That is impossible", otherwise
I would have thought maybe anybody could do it.

"In other cases though, say (when you are organizing information and
providing solutions) [1] - based on that - to your boss, you might
want to (be like Tiger Woods, conscious, controlled and not
automatic)[2]"

You've described [2] using a lovely concrete example. However, [1] is
sorely lacking in examples. What is this "organizing information"? Or
"providing solutions"? That could be anything from "it's hot today"
all the way up to "e = mc^2". Contrast that to PG's [business plan](http://www.paulgraham.com/vwplan.html)
for his startup in 1995:

OVERVIEW Webgen allows clients to generate web catalogs remotely.

There are several other companies that can generate and serve web
catalogs. The best known site of this type is Marketplace MCI
(www.internetmci.com). But while these other sites use their
generators in-house to build catalogs from materials provided by
clients, Webgen's generator can be used interactively by anyone with a
modem and a copy of Netscape. ...

You might want to describe what you're doing in such terms, like
"generate web catalogs remotely" or "used interactively", so that it
clear even to an outsider what you're doing.

I appreciate the fact that you followed the deliberate practice method
rigorously by making notes, setting them aside, and coming back
later. Great work!

* * * * *

Mission #5: Time to chunk it up. Right now, you are working on
sentences and paragraphs at a time. That is, you get feedback about
your output dimensions after writing the entire paragraph (or God
forbid, the entire essay). The feedback isn't immediate enough
(principle #3 from TiO). In contrast, look at how I narrowed down the
specific phrases [1] and [2] where you gave examples or not.

You need to take passages you feel you don't understand clearly
(perhaps some things you've written yourself about important yet
unclear issues in "rationality" and some outside material about tough
technical problems), mark within parentheses each important phrase
like I did with [1] and [2], check if you've given an example for it,
and if not, rewrite it with a concrete example. If you're not sure if
a phrase is important or not, err in favour of an example. 200
repetitions should be a good start. Soon, you will come to notice
immediately if you are throwing out words without any concrete
example, the way a misspelled word in an editor shows up with red
underlines.

Does it mean that PG and EY will give examples after every phrase? Not
necessarily. But they will have an example in mind as they write. I
suspect that when we say "people don't think clearly", we mean that
their words don't correspond to any concrete example (see: "critical
thinking"). And when your words don't correspond to anything concrete,
you can make them say anything. For a striking example, check out this
philosophical passage that EY tore to pieces:
https://youtu.be/D6peN9LiTWA?t=1067

What was the problem there? The words didn't correspond to any known
piece of reality. They were figments of the poet's imagination, and
yet he thought they described something real. It sounded convincing
even to me. I was like, yeah, maybe we really are fallen people
compared to those wise, brotherly ancients.

How would you and I tackle that? We would stop at the first phrase in
the first sentence: "In the age when life on Earth was full". Ok. Give
me a historical example or empirical evidence for what you mean by
"life on Earth was full". People had ACs? Cars? Long lives? Lots of
sex? (Could be true. Could also be not true. Need empirical
evidence. And if you say you can't get that evidence from millenia
ago... well, that's the whole point! Why are you using as an example
something that you have no real evidence about? End of story then and
there.)

Let's take another example closer to home. "I need to practice
critical thinking and become a master." - Anonymous, 1785 AD. Well,
Mr. Anonymous, what is this "critical thinking" you speak of? Let's
see at least one example (after you've practiced on a bunch of other
sentences).

decisions you make in the name of rationality. I love you bro! You --
complete me! I am sorry.

Same here, machan. I pushed you to get on the deliberate practice
horse and you pushed me to come up with a concrete usable model of
deliberate practice and do actual practice everyday. "I think you and
I are destined to do this forever."

I believe you but I thought that you were poking fun at the fact that
I hadn't actually practiced despite knowing about the theory for
years. It just felt like I was being as encouraging as I could
possibly be, overlooking any inconsistencies and being patient for
years and years and focusing on how you're improving instead of
criticizing you with very high standards, and in return, I felt I was
getting snark.

I wish I weren't this easily annoyed, but that skill comes
later. Instead of trying to hide my annoyance and act like there
wasn't any problem, I wanted to express my true thoughts. Hopefully,
we can move past this.

*****

Great work on actually practicing. Can the practice regimen be better?
Yes, but the point is to keep moving.

"On what output dimensions do you compare? That is the precise
question that will provide feedback, like when you are under the
Hogainagal waterfall, instant and harsh." - That was a nice
touch. Writing rule #8, anybody?


Can we please get down to business? I am sorry once again my main man.

I really am sorry too.

*****

Mission #4: Concrete examples. This is the only output dimension to
focus on right now. "Concrete" means "no high-level descriptions".

For example, instead of "You run scenarios in your mind where you are
verbally battling with them", you would give an example of a "verbal
battle". Or, when we see "The book ‘Talent is Overrated’ seems to
suggest that greatness is not only for a select few.", we should also
know what "greatness" looks like and who those "select few" were who
we wrongly assumed to be sole possessors of talent. And when you say
"In fact there exists a path that runs between your current abilities
to that of the greats.", I would like a concrete example for this bold
claim (maybe a video like this). And, finally, "The journey will be
hard, long and demanding." - like how hard, how long, and how
demanding?

RorG may not be a good instance of that since, for obvious reasons,
concrete examples couldn't be mentioned.

Most importantly, the aim is not to just notice where you fall short,
but to actually change your response till it satisfies the
dimension. Only then is the practice rep complete.

Best,


Hit me back, just a chat, truly yours, Its this An

Thalaiva,

I have fallen sick for the last two days! Forgive! I hope to get
better tomorrow! I Keep you posted.

Thalaiva,

I am able to sit on my laptop again. I am well. I will start on march
5 (beginning of next week). Until then have quite some distractions
everyday, with signing contract and moving to the new house, starting
work etc.., shifting to new place, unable to get a block of 5 days.

From March 5, I don't see any reasonable distractions anymore. I will
setup everything on 4th and be ready to kill from 5. Until then, I
will work on finishing another course in Data science (DS)

Regards, Thej Kiran Ravichandran

You need to break down the "phrase" even further. Instead of "designed
specifically to improve performance", which has two main parts, make
it "designed specifically" and "improve performance". That way, for
"improve performance", you get to know exactly what you mean by
"performance".

P: designed specifically E1: For work, I made a verification box for
only one reason, to verify module A.  E2: With the goal of maximizing
muscle mass Scooby designed this workout exclusively for that.

P: improve performance E1: My current shooting percentage is 50%
without defender, at location X on the court. I would like to improve
this to 80%.  E2: Going from 20kg/hand to 25kg/hand for 8 reps in the
next 2 months for bench pressing to be a good performance improvement.

You said "highly demanding mentally" but you spoke about "physically
tired". I can't see an example for "mental tiredness". That's why it's
important to break it down.

I still don't see anything "mental".

P: highly demanding E1: Scooby's advanced-extreme-gym-workout has 9
exercises to be done in 3 supersets with 30 to 180s rest between
supersets, and no rest between sets. By the time you reach the 3rd
superset, I already want to give up, but I still need to keep
grinding.  E2: On the last day of my last mission I had 25 more
phrases to complete to reach 200. I was already working for more than
6-8 hrs that day. I started working on it and just couldn't sustain
concentration. I was unable to read and identify examples. I was
tapping out mentally!  E3: While attempting an average 175bpm for 20
minutes biking, @10 mins already had enough, but you still need to
keep going for another full 10 minutes while your body keeps screaming
to stop.

P: Mentally E1: Identifying where examples are available in an essay
is a mental task (tasks that need "concentration and focus").  E2:
Tasks involving problem solving such as at work. Once I was asked to
identify the source of leak for the system. Designing experiments to
isolate each source is a mental task.  E3: A type of practice is to
freeze the basketball game for a given position of the players, and
make a thought experiment of what are the possible moves by different
players to score a basket.

 
> P: Hopefully gets me to amazing levels
>
> E: amazing levels like that of my peers (in a year or two)

Which part of that was **concrete**? I don't know anything about those
"peers". Contrast that to "landing 3-pointers more than 60% of the
time".

But, STM, how can anyone notice those kinds of details? It's too vague
and hard to see. It's an "art", Mr. White.

Personal story: Guy in the gym had joined around the same time as
me. Within a couple of months, he was noticeably more buff than I was
even though we both went six days a week. What's up with that? Decided
to pair up with him on a biceps workout. "We'll learn that both of us
have basically the same amount of muscle. Maybe it's not as visible
for me because of fat or height or whatever." -- Anonymous III, at the
start of the biceps workout.

Within three sets, I was **finished**. This guy pushed himself like a
motherfucker. Maximum weights on the barbell for curls and maximum
number of reps even when his face was red and he was grunting and so
on. Next to him, my workouts were like a stroll in the park. I thought
maybe he overdid it today and we're going take a break. Nope. Next
exercise - with just as much intensity. Fuck me. There was a reason
why he had put on more muscle. And once he and I did the same thing
side by side, the difference was obvious.

Moral of the story: Find out exactly in which ways they are
"better". How? Dot dot dot.

>Find out exactly in which ways they are "better"
 
Unfortunately, I needed some spoonfeeding on this one! I understand
your feeling ("which part of that was concrete"). It took until the
'moral of the story' to understand this. Wow! Humbled max! Thanks!
Facepalm! I was sure I would have impressed you with this example. I
thought I had it (PEERS)! Live and learn!

P: amazing levels of my peers E: So Chao shoots 3 pointers like there
is no tomorrow and probably has an in game 3 pointer percentage of 70%
even. Joe in practice can get 80% on the radius of the free throw
line. Maciej can drill any layup without getting blocked.
 
> P: this will do jack shit to your performance
>
> E: You will NEVER be better than your peers.

I'm too dumb to understand this sentence, especially when there is no
concrete example for miles. Especially taxing on my brain are the
words "be better" and "peers".

Facepalm again! You didn't hold back from tearing me
apart. Hahahahahah! Keep it coming Thalaiva! "I need this ma". Don't
hold back! It shows me your frustration. Thanks!

Great concrete example. You can just say "a lot" = "100 times, not
just 20 times". No need to write long sentences.

Copy that!

Again, chunk it up. What does "feedback on results" look like? Say,
shooting percentage. (Why not also measure categories like "missed
completely" and "hit the rim" and "nothing but net"? Fine-grained
feedback as opposed to "in" and "out".)

Next, what does "continuously available" look like? Maybe you're
counting the last 10 balls and the success percentage therein. This is
continuous, as opposed to "go home and log it after taking a shower
and maybe having dinner", which is the exact opposite of "continuously
available".

Basically, you should be able to point from the abstract phrase
"feedback on results" to the concrete example "percentage of last 10
balls". Currently, that's hard to do because your example talks about
multiple phrases.

Sema bro! this is what I need, concrete examples on where exactly I am
lacking!

P: feedback on results E: Shooting percentage (with categories such as
"nothing but the net", "hit the rim", and "missed completely") I would
like such feedback but It's hard to count while you are trying to
focus and shoot I feel, that is why I stick to shot percentage. Maybe
I should add them slowly or measure them seperately by doing the same
sequence of shots.  E2: example identifying rate gives me feedback on
how much more there is to complete while I am DPing.  E3: Feedback on
identifying the right phrases that need the right examples, is done by
me at the spot, but an STM looks over later and gives his feedback to
improve my feedback capabilities.

Citation needed. The two articles don't mention him quitting practice
in general only after he makes 400 shots.

This was not Kobe:

No evidence that the following was more than a one-time incident:

> a.m. to 11 a.m., refusing to leave the gym until he made 800 shots.

You are right it was not Kobe and it was probably not daily! Sorry
about that! But the 800 shots is still an example of intently working
on improving his shooting.
 
P: work on them intently E1: "Joan Sutherland devoted countless hours
to practicing her trill" E2: "Tiger woods would work on practicing
shots that were buried into the sand (by him stepping on it - the ball
would never be as deep)" E3: "Arakawa's road to the gold medal
involved at least twenty thousand derriere impacts on an unforgiving
surface."

> P: see a couple of issues and isolate each one of them

This should have been two separate phrases.  P: Couple of issues E:
vocabulary, organization of points in an essay P: isolate each one E:
designing practice to focusing only on vocabulary with the infamous BF
method.

This should have been:

"I counted eight, Mr. Wayne."

Why break it up? Because you haven't given an example for "quite
motivating" and, what's worse, you haven't noticed. You showed that
175 bpm would be daunting, but you didn't mention whether you
succeeded in going at 165 bpm. If you didn't, it's not an example that
actually happened (similar to the poem mentioned in the introduction).

 
P: while learning E: While aiming to reach 180bpm over 20 mins P: it

day. 165bpm however keeps me on my toes without having to swear to the
gods for putting me through this and cursing that I will never bike
again. 165bpm is just beyond 161bpm.  P: our comfort zone E: For me

Thalaiva this one is especially good (SST)! Kudos! This was very hard
even after you pointed out the P's

My answer: Ball buried in sand is for [2], Woods burying balls on
purpose is for [1], and the fact that he can hit sand balls whereas
others suck balls is to show [3].

Notice how it's easy to give just one example for one part of a long
sentence and mislead yourself into thinking that you've got the whole
sentence covered. Check your response:

> E: One of the important aspects of "critical thinking" is to see all
> words as clear cut examples and not as vague sentences. Identifying
> where examples are needed and providing them is the skill

Looks good, on the face of it. After all, it's got 34 words. But the
only example it has is "see all words as clear cut examples and not as
vague sentences", which is for [2] (and is not all that concrete). You
haven't shown how you would isolate it [1] or why it is key
[3]. You've just stated again that it is "one of the important
aspects", which is a high-level rephrasing of [3] but not a concrete
example.

And is it a coincidence that the very thing you feel confused about
when it comes to "critical thinking" is exactly how important it is
[3] and how to practice it [1]? You're a detective now, son.

Bro again! Awesome! vera onnum solrathuku illai! Shows me how much I
have to improve and get better! Long way to go! But will get there
#DP! Thank You for the detailed explanation.

should be

For [1], you can imagine the graph or output of weight going from 107
kg and 125 kg (or whatever).

For [2], you need to show what inaccurate load modeling looks like
(maybe, you took 360 measurements per minute), show what accurate load
modeling looks like (maybe you now take 720 measurements per minute),
and then show that it is indeed worthy of the adjective "accurate"
(maybe the error magnitude goes down).

For [3], you think again about the load output values.

For [4], you show how it was 107 kg five minutes ago and is now 208
kg.

Here's how I would have approached the abstract (for deliberate
practice):

> Abstract - This paper presents a (new)[1] (paradigm)[2] for design
> of (mechanical components)[3] that are subjected to (dynamic)[4]
> (loading)[5] in their (regular operation)[6].

For [2], what was the existing "paradigm"? What does a "paradigm" look
like? Is it a set of equations or a function for doing something? Once
you can show the existing "paradigm", you can then write your new
"paradigm" in a similar format.

I bet that, when you wrote this, you probably didn't have a clear
example of a "paradigm".

For [1], how is it "new"? Show yourself the differences from the
existing "paradigm". Maybe the equation uses x^3 of x^2. That is a
specific new change.

For [3], think of the actual, concrete components by name. Are they
three parts "Foo137", "Bar7.0", and "Baz 9A44" joined together?

For [5], think of the weight output in the simulator or in some
instrument.

For [4], show how your adjective "dynamic" is justified. Why isn't it
called just "loading"? What made you add the "dynamic" to it? Why not
"static"? Maybe this involves the weight output changing over minutes.

For [6], show (or think about, when writing the paper) what "regular
operation" looks like. For example, the regular operation of a car is
to have people sit inside, get the engine started, run at 40 mph for
half an hour or so, with a couple of stops, and stay off till
evening. Abnormal operation would be taking your sedan on an
off-terrain path or driving at 150 mph for three hours straight. Your
description doesn't have to be incredibly detailed, but it has to be
something concrete you can refer to every time you use the word
"regular operation".

> E: for example using Finite Element Methods

That is not an example. An example would be some paper you read "Foo:
Finite Element Method applied to Table Fan Components" (2016) or some
project you did. "For example using Finite Element Method" is just
hand-wavy, wishful thinking (unless you have an example in mind). Here
are some questions that you would be able to answer if you had a
concrete example: How many more lines of code or equations would it
take? How much longer would that simulation run? Which parts are you
not sure about how to implement? You won't be able to answer these
questions empirically if you just say "use Finite Element Methods".

This **is** an example. Kudos on the 4000 rpm. However, it is an
example only for the component. You haven't given concrete examples
for "dynamic loads" or "static loads". What are their actual values?
3000 kg (or whatever)?

Citation (and concrete example) needed. If you've heard about before,
you should have a ready example, either from some paper or some
textbook or your own project. I expect something like "when Toyota did
this to their engine in 2009, it broke within a few thousand test
runs". If you don't really have an example, what do you think you know
and how do you think you know it?

Again, that is not an example. An example looks like this: In the five
projects in our company (in your mind, you can recall their names A to
E) where experienced engineers designed load systems, they set the
inertial terms to 0, which makes computation faster (by 5 hours on
average) and so on.

Will you always know the stats like 5 hours? Not necessarily, but if
it is a key point in your argument, you should.

Again, that is theory, not a concrete example. Every single part of
your "E" is abstract: "increase mass" (by how much?), "part" (name?),
"inertia" (what was the value?), "increases" (by how much?). Show an
example where increasing one increases the other. (You won't write it
in the paper; this is for your practice.) If you can't think of a
concrete example offhand, do you really understand the concept?

Usually? Where? In experiments done by kids? By adults? Penguins?
Experts?

How often? 30% of the time? How do you know?

> analysis of a connecting rod

Concrete example, please, either from your project or from some
textbook.

Good that you mentioned the time taken (1 hour) to justify
"huge". However, we don't see a concrete example for "huge computer
model" that uses Finite Element Methods. Just saying the abstract
method isn't enough. Maybe point to something from your company (in
your own mind) or some famous open-source model.

> P: kinetostatic analysis model

Again, a theoretical sentence. Whose crank? At what speed?

* * * * *

In short, please avoid using a term like "kinetostatic analysis model"
or "paradigm" or "coupled nature" without a concrete example in mind.

 
Yes thank you for taking the time and effort to do this in such
detail! Really appreciate it. On to some more DP!

 
Mission #6: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, would be to
clarify material that genuinely confuses you. (Did your spider-sense
start tingling for the last two phrases? It should have.)

Primary target: Some work-related document that you need to understand
thoroughly but currently don't. Take it apart almost word-by-word and
provide a *concrete* example for each one.

For example, "habeas corpus" sounds like a confusing legal term. But
once I've seen an example for it
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus#Examples), I know it
pretty well and can follow along when I hear it in another case. Even
somebody who has no idea of the jargon can understand by looking at
the concrete example. Note that the theoretical definition ("Habeas
corpus is a recourse in law through which a person can report an
unlawful detention or imprisonment to a court and request that the
court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to
bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is
lawful.") is not good enough - it's not a concrete example.

Secondary target: Some non-technical document that you want to
understand thoroughly but currently don't.

Reps: 200.

Success criteria: Does it feel less confusing? Does it now feel
crystal-clear? (<spider-sense tingling>)

Best,
