## Summary

The Goal of this book is to provide you countless examples and explain
to us what is the difference between normal people and extraordinary
talents.

How we might try to get there is also suggested.


### Chapter 1: Mystery

We look at Mozart, Tiger Woods, Federer and never even think in our
right minds that we can be like them or even close to them. We think
its got a lot to do with luck and where your from and your genes
etc...

What separates hard workers from the ultimate successful people?
Lot of hard work? Experience? Talent? intelligence?

### Chapter 2: Talent is overrated

> Once training begins, we would suppose that talent would certainly
> show itself; after only three piano lessons, little Ashley is
> playing pieces that other kids need six months to learn. But again,
> this does not hap- pen reliably in people who go on to achieve a
> great deal. In a study of outstanding American pianists, for
> example, you could not have pre- dicted their eventual high level of
> achievement even after they'd been training intensively for six
> years; at that point most of them still weren't standing out from
> their peers.

Talent refuses to show itself even after many many years in people
reliably who go on to acheive the greatest heights. So what is this
talent then?

**But what about Mozart and Tiger woods?**
In both cases their fathers seem to be great teachers, and the time of
peaking seemed to be after quite some time or atleast a few
decades. The things they seem to have done when they were young seems
to either be less founded or not as great as expected.

>Mozart's first work regarded today as a masterpiece, with its status
>confirmed by the number of recordings available, is his Piano Concerto
>No. 9, com- posed when he was twenty-one. That's certainly an early
>age, but we must remember that by then Wolfgang

>If the average music student needs six years of preparation before
> publicly playing a piece, and a given prodigy did it after three
> years, that student would have an index of zoo percent. Mozart's
> index is around 13o percent, clearly ahead of average students. But
> twentieth-century prodigies score 30o percent to 500 percent. This
> is another example of rising standards. The effects of today's
> improved training methods apparently swamp the effects of Mozart's
> genius as a performer.

If you look at tigers history, his father was a good golf player and
his parents dedicated their lives to getting him to be the best with
the best coaching and beginning at the age of 7 months, seemingly
giving a head start to his career.

If you look at Jack Welch, CEO GE

>Jack Welch, named by Fortune magazine as the twentieth century's
> manager of the century, showed no particular inclination toward
> business, even into his midtwenties.

>He finally decided to accept an offer to work in a chemical
> development operation at General Electric.  If anything in Welch's
> history to that point suggests that he would become the most
> influential business manager of his time, it's tough— in fact,
> impossible—to spot it.

The author looks at many other examples and concludes the point that
Talent, as something that we were born with that helps us become the
best of the best, seems quite unlikely to exist, pretty much because
there seems to be barely any evidence as of this moment.

Maybe it was not talent or genes for playing a particular instrument
but something like Intelligence and Memory are two important things
that the greats could have been born with right?

### Chapter 3: IQ?

DO greats possess incredible abilities in memory and Intelligence?

>A wide range of research shows that the correlations between IQ and
> achievement aren't nearly as strong as the data on broad averages
> would suggest, and in many cases there's no correlation at all.
> Consider, for example, a study of salespeople. This was a so-called
> meta-analysis, the largest of its type ever conducted, gathering
> data from several dozen previous studies looking at almost forty-six
> thou- sand individuals. Studying businesspeople in the real world is
> tough because you generally can't control the conditions, and the
> results are often unclear; whether a decision was good or bad may
> not be known for years. Salespeople make attractive subjects for
> researchers because at least they produce something clear to
> measure: sales. There may still be endless sources of noise in the
> results, as salespeople explain elo- quently to their bosses, but
> over time and over large numbers of sub- jects, most of that should
> wash out.  In this analysis of analyses, the researchers found that
> if you ask salespeople's bosses to rate them, the ratings track
> intelligence moder- ately well; bosses tend to think that smarter
> salespeople are better. But when the researchers compared
> intelligence with actual sales results, they found
> nothing. Intelligence was virtually useless in predicting how well a
> salesperson would perform. Whatever it is that makes a sales ace, it
> seems to be something other than brainpower.

>IQ is a decent predictor of performance on an unfamiliar task, but
>once a person has been at a job for a few years, IQ predicts littel
>or nothing about performance.

Betting on horses example
>The researchers' conclusion: Their results suggest "that whatever it
> is that an IQ test measures, it is not the ability to engage in cognitively
> complex forms of multivariate reasoning.

Same results reproduced in Chess grand masters and even the game GO
and scrabble players below average for verbal ability.


And what about memory,

>For example, former GE chief Jack
> Welch was famous for seeming to remember everything about one of
> the world's largest and most complicated companies, the kind of guy
> who could spot an inconsistency on the twenty-sixth line of a financial
> statement during an operating review that was glazing everyone else's
> eyes.


Countless studies seem to show that it is also acquired and only for
specific tasks. i.e, when he trained to develop memory, but having
trained that he is not able to do any better in say using random
consonents!


Example of SF

> The Czech master Richard Reti once played twenty-nine blindfolded
games simultaneously.

>Miguel Najdorf, a Polish-Argentinean grand master, played forty-five
blindfolded games simultaneously in Sao Paulo in 1947;

The point is that they are normal as everyone else, if it was not for
chess. They do not seem to have this powerful inate memory ability in
other things as seen in the study below:

>It's hard to believe that any normal person could do such things. But
> consider a study in which highly skilled chess players as well as non-
> players were shown chessboards with twenty to twenty-five pieces set
> up as they were in actual games; the research subjects were shown the
> boards only briefly—five to ten seconds—and then asked to recall the
> positions of the pieces. The results were what you'd expect: The chess
> masters could typically recall the position of every piece, while the non-
> players could place only four or five pieces. Then the researchers re-
> peated the procedure, this time with pieces positioned not as in actual
> games but randomly. The nonplayers again could place only four or five
> pieces. But the masters, who had been studying chessboards for most
> of their lives, did scarcely better, placing only six or seven pieces.
> The chess masters did not have incredible memories. What they had
> was an incredible ability to remember real chess positions.

He couldn't
have done it with any other thing but only chess. Similarly even with
GO and Gomuku. SF's incredible memory didn't extend to consonants.




Major companies look for the extrodinary based on the SATs and other
things related to IQ, but as we have seen above, these are not 

They help perform better at an unfamiliar task but thats it and within
no time High IQ and low IQ players are going to be the same?

GE doesn't necessaryly look for people from Elite schools, it look at
other things for example.

**Are there any constriants to acheive greatness**

- Death
- physical limitations 
  - such as personal dimensions
  - basketball players
  - NFL players 
  - age

>Logical next question: Are you stuck with the personality traits you
> have? Research going back decades suggests that personality dimen-
> sions don't vary much over the course of a person's life. But of
> course that doesn't necessarily limit a person's achievement; it may
> limit only 48 How Smart Do You Have to Be?  the fields in which a
> person is most likely to excel. I

**So there are physical constraints**

**Clear evidence of these non-physical constraints hasn't been found**

### Chapter 4: A better idea

In this chapter the author shows us one example of a super great
athelete who is one of his kind and what separates him from everyone
else in his field. Jerry Rice was quite good but not as good as the
NFL wanted him to be. The problem was his speed.

>In the 1985 draft, fifteen teams passed him over before the San
Francisco 49ers finally signed him.

**How the hell did such a player become a fucking legend, the greatest
receiver in NFL history?**

> He played twenty seasons at a position that is no-toriously
> perilous, and he played in almost every game of every season except
> one, 1997, when he was out for fourteen weeks because of an injury
> and returned sooner than his doctors advised. For some future player
> to perform at such an extremely high standard for so many years in a
> physically brutal game is obviously not impossible, but history sug-
> gests that it is unlikely.

>veryone in the football world seems to agree that Rice was the
> greatest because he worked harder in practice and in the off-season
> than anyone else.  In team workouts he was famous for his hustle;
> while many receiv- ers will trot back to the quarterback after
> catching a pass, Rice would sprint to the end zone after each
> reception. He would typically continue practicing long after the
> rest of the team had gone home. Most remark- able were his
> six-days-a-week off-season workouts, which he conducted entirely on
> his own. Mornings were devoted to cardiovascular work, running a
> hilly five-mile trail; he would reportedly run ten forty-meter wind
> sprints up the steepest part. In the afternoons he did equally
> strenuous weight training. These workouts became legendary as the
> most demanding in the league, and other players would sometimes join
> Rice just to see what it was like. Some of them got sick before the
> day was over.



Hard work makes a difference, but everyone did hardwork, what did he
do differently?

- Just playing was not enough as it was a small percentage of the
  football work he was doing
- He designed his practice to work on his specific needs 
- > Not being the fastest receiver in the league turned out not to
matter. He became famous for the precision of his patterns.
- It wasn't fun. He worked till pure exhaustion and failure of
  muscles.
  
- he defied age limits

>Wide receivers, who run like hell on most plays and
> frequently get crushed by tacklers, aren't supposed to last twenty sea-
> sons or play until age forty-two. None but Rice has ever done so.

**The crucial finding**

3 groups of violinsts, the best who were going to be solo performers,
the next best as decided by the professors of the school and the third
devision who would most likely become teachers.

After a through study it showed that why each group was so different
from each other despite being very similar, in age, current time
dedicated to music, was that

amount of practice time told that group A and group B had the same and
group C was shit.

But despite group A and B was the same why were they so different?

>he first group had accumulated 7,410 hours of lifetime practice on
> average, versus 5,301 hours for violinists in the second group and
> 3,420 hours for those in the third group


>No matter who they were, or what explanation of their
> performance was being advanced, it always took them many years to
> become excellent, and if a person achieves elite status only after many
> years of toil, assigning the principal role in that success to innate gifts
> becomes problematic, to say the least.


>Many scientists and authors produce their greatest work only after
> twenty or more years of devoted effort, which means that in year nine-
> teen they are still getting better

>They slept more. They not only slept more at night, they also took
far more afternoon naps. All that practicing seems to demand a lot of
recovery.


>The vast majority of people we work with, or play golf with, or play
> Doom with, got better for a while and then leveled off, having appar-
> ently reached the limit of their abilities; years of further work have
> not made them any better. On the other hand, we see repeatedly that
> the people who have achieved the most are the ones who have worked the
> hardest. How can both sets of observations be true?

>Their framework is not based on a simplistic "practice makes perfect"
> observation. Rather, it is based on their highly specific concept of
> "deliberate practice."


### Chapter 5: What is deliberate practice and what isn't


Going to basketball practice and trying a few shots, then trying to
improve dribbling and then trying to do some thing else a few
times. Ah the satisfaction, I have practiced and have gotten better.

>Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
> examining. It is activity designed specifically to improve performance,
> often with a teacher's help; it can be repeated a lot; feedback on results
> is continuously available; it's highly demanding mentally, whether the
> activity is purely intellectual, such as chess or business-related activi-
> ties, or heavily physical, such as sports; and it isn't much fun.

>But anyone who thinks they've outgrown the benefits of a teacher's
help should at least question that view

> Without a clear, unbiased view of the subject's perfor- mance,
choosing the best practice activity will be impossible;

>They're meant to stretch the individual beyond his or her current
abilities.

>By contrast, deliberate practice requires that one identify certain
> sharply defined elements of performance that need to be improved,
> and then work intently on them

>The great performers isolate remarkably specific aspects
> of what they do and focus on just those things until they are improved;
> then it's on to the next aspect.

You always want to be in a space which is slightly outside your
comfort zone.

>Identifying the learning zone, which is not simple, and then forcing
oneself to stay continually in it as it changes, which is even harder—
these are the first and most important characteristics of deliberate
practice

**Repeat a lot**
>Tiger Woods may face that buried lie in the sand only two or three
times in a season,

>Top performers repeat their practice activities to stultify- ing
> extent. Ted Williams, baseball's greatest hitter, would practice hit-
> ting until his hands bled. Pete Maravich, whose college basketball
> records still stand after more than thirty years, would go to the gym
> when it opened in the morning and shoot baskets until it closed at
> night.


>You can work on technique all you like, but if you can't see
the effects, two things will happen: You won't get any better, and you'll
stop caring.

>Difficulties arise when the results require in- terpretation. You may
believe you played that bar of the Brahms Violin Concerto perfectly,
but can you really trust your own judgment?

>A finding that is remarkably consistent across disciplines is that
four or five hours a day seems to be the upper limit of deliberate
practice, and this is frequently accomplished in sessions lasting no
more than an hour to ninety minutes.

>Continually seeking exactly those elements of performance that are Is
and Isn't unsatisfactory and then trying one's hardest to make them
better places enormous strains on anyone's mental abilities.

**It is painful**

>Then we iden- tify the painful, difficult activities that will make
> us better and do those things over and over.

>It must be so. If the activities that lead to greatness were easy and
> fun, then everyone would do them and they would not distinguish the
> best from the rest. The reality that deliberate practice is hard can
> even be seen as good news. It means that most people won't do it. So
> your will- ingness to do it will distinguish you all the more

**Life at companies**

>In fact, life at most companies seems almost intended to defeat all
> the principles of deliberate practice.

>You could say that work, like deliberate practice, is often mentally
> demanding and tiring. But that's typically not because of the intense
> focus and concentration involved. Rather, it's more often a result of
> long hours cranking out what we already know how to do. And if we're
> exhausted from that, the prospect of spending additional hours on gen-
> uine deliberate practice activities seems too miserable to contemplate.
> Similarly, work is often not fun. But again, that's not because we're try-
> ing to push beyond the edge of our abilities. It's because getting any-
> thing accomplished in the real world is a grind.


**Chris rock as example**

>Rock designed all those small-club appearances for the sole purpose
> of making himself better; because he already performs at a very high
> level, he's completely qualified to design his own practice. The
> high repetition in the process is particularly striking—appearance
> after appearance, working the ma- terial "over and over."

**The story of Polgar sisters**

How a father brought up 3 of his daughters for the sole reason of
raising them as winners. He chose chess to raise them up in as it had
fairly good study material and was well studied game.

All three went to very high levels and based on their further
commitment after becoming more than 20 decided were they would land.

**Could the explanation possibly be genetic?**

Oboe genes are almost certain they don't exist. 

>But practice proponents do not dispute the possibility that genes
> could play a role in a person's willingness to put himself or
> herself through the extremely rigorous demands of becoming an
> exceptional performer.



### Chap 6: How deliberate practice works

#### More like characteristics of DP'ers.
**Perceive more**

They look ahead, they know where to look to get more information, for
example with tennis players trying to predict where the ball is
expected to go or typewriters looking at a few words ahead to change
their fingering to type more. or doctors looking at X-rays to see far
more serious issues in an xray than simpler folk.

**They understand the significance of indicators that average
performers don't even notice.
**

**They look into the future**
>For example, Shell's scenario planning process famously prepared it
> for the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s. No scenario told Shell's manag-
> ers the embargo would happen, since scenarios are thought exercises,
> not predictions. But one of the scenarios the strategy group cooked up
> envisioned an accident in Saudi Arabia that raised the price of oil, caus-
> ing Arab producers to rethink why they set prices as they did. Shell
> managers carried the analysis further and realized that Arab producers,
> angry with the United States for its support of Israel in the Six-
> Day War,
> might believe they could serve many purposes at once by launching an
> embargo or restricting supply.

#### Knowing more

>You didn't really have to know much about a field if you knew the
best ways to analyze a problem and think it through, and you needed to
know even less if your analysis and reasoning power could be juiced by
a computer

>The answer is that the human possessed something the computer didn't,
which was vast knowledge of chess—how previous masters had responded
to par- ticular positions in many different cases, and what kinds of
choices generally produced what kinds of consequences. 

>In chess, researchers have found (using a method I'll describe a
> little later) that master-level play- ers possess more chess knowledge
> than good club-level players by a huge margin, a factor of ten to one
> hundred. Just as important, top per- formers in a wide range of fields
> have better organized and consolidated their knowledge, enabling them
> to approach problems in fundamen- tally different and more useful
> ways.

#### Remembering more

>Many decades of research have
> shown that average short-term memory holds only about seven items.
> The capacity of short-term memory doesn't seem to vary much from
> person to person; virtually everyone's short-term memory falls in the
> range of five to nine items.

>Everyone in the experiment remembered more or less the same
> number of chunks of information. For the novices, a particular piece
> on a particular square was a chunk. But for the masters, who had stud-
> ied real positions for years, a chunk was much larger, consisting of a
> whole group of pieces in a specific arrangement.
> The difference is much like the difference between letters and words.
> Imagine that you knew all the letters of the alphabet but had no idea
> that they could be assembled into words.

>Researchers estimate that good club players
> have a "vocabulary" of about 1,000 chunks, while the highest-ranked
> players have a vocabulary of 10,000 to 100,000.

But some people play 49 games blindfolded, how is that possible?

>In the real world, the great power of long-term working memory—the
reason it distin- guishes the best performers—is that it's built on a
retrieval structure connected to the very essence of the activity.


>To illustrate, consider first a simple research study involving two
> groups: devoted baseball fans and casual observers of the game. Both
> groups were given an engagingly written description of a half-inning
> of a game. Later, the devoted fans were much better able to recall the
> events that mattered to the game's outcome—advancing runners, pre-
> venting runs scored, and so on. The casual observers tended to remem-
> ber colorful but irrelevant details, such as the crowd's mood and the
> weather. The fans' high-level knowledge of the game provided a frame-
> work on which to hang the information they had read.

> In the letters-versus-words analogy, it isn't just that novices see
> letters while experts see words; the experts also know the meanings
> of the words.  It's clear that the superior memory of great
> performers doesn't just happen. Since it is built on deep
> understanding of the field, it can be achieved only through years of
> intensive study. It further requires con- sistently relating new
> information to higher-level concepts, which is hard work.

>It exerts an additional, overarching influence that in a way is even
more impressive: It can actually alter the physical nature of a
person's brain and body

Changes to the body, the brain the heart even can happen to aid you in
your field on DP, for you to create the right type of "hooks" on which
you can hang the wide amount of knowledge.

>There is in fact a path leading from the state of our own abilities
> to that of the greats. The path is extremely long and demanding, and
> only a few will follow it all the way to its end



### Chap 7: appling to our lives

**Designning deliberate practice**

How did benji Franklin do it?

**Know where you want to go!**

>But in the great majority of careers, and in the advanced stages of
all of them, there is no published curriculum, no syllabus of
materials that must be studied and mastered. In deciding which skills
and abilities to work on, and how to do it, you're on your own

>The skills and abilities one can choose to develop are infinite, but
the opportunities to practice them fall into two general categories:
op- portunities to practice directly, apart from the actual use of the
skill or ability, the way a musician practices a piece before
performing it; and opportunities to practice as part of the work
itself.

**the music model**

>Think of all the ways it could be done much better. One could ana-
lyze the text of the talk and in each section determine the most
impor- tant idea to be conveyed—passion, logical inevitability, common
bonds with the audience, humor—and then work on each section
repeatedly, constantly striving to express that key idea more
effectively, with feed- back after each repetition, either from a
coach or by watching video.

basically see where you such at and improve that part alone. Whether
you need to make a presentation or whether you need to perform in
front of someone.

>Even being interviewed—by a prospective employer or by the news
media—can be practiced in this way. After all, in those situations you
probably know the key messages that you intend to convey, regardless
of the questions you're asked.


> For straightforward written work, the multipart Ben Franklin
technique would be appropriate; instead of emulating the Spectator,
you would choose a superior letter to the shareholders, advertisement,
blog entry, or other appropriate model. 

**The chess model**

>Thousands of books of such positions have been published.  The
practice routine is to study a particular position and choose the move
you would make, then compare it with the move chosen by the master; if
they're different, figure out why and which is better.

How you can apply this to business is, to 

>You're presented with a problem, and your job is to figure out a
solution. Real life being the way it is, you often won't know whether
the solution chosen by the case's protagonist was the best one
possible, or whether yours was any better. But the process of focusing
on the problem and evaluating proposed solutions is powerfully
instructive, which helps explain why the case method

> You might work in marketing for years and get only a couple of
chances to market U.S. products in China, for ex- ample, so that's a
skill you probably wouldn't be very good at. But in a short time you
could study a dozen cases about marketing U.S. products in Our Lives
in China. That's one step removed from actually marketing the prod-
ucts, but it puts you many steps ahead of anyone who has not studied
that specific skill intensely and repeatedly

**The sports model**
Conditioning and working on specific critical skills

>NFL linemen build their leg muscles in a way that pro- duces
explosive power; tennis players work on stamina so they can still get
to the ball three hours into a match. The other category of practice
is working on specific critical skills—batting a baseball, throwing a
football, hitting a golf ball out of the sand. A characteristic that
many of these skills share is that they must be performed differently
every time because the situations in which they're encountered are
never the same.

>In many cases this is stuff you learned in high school or college,
and it's tempting to think you couldn't possi- bly benefit from
revisiting it. But the truth is that these strengths, like physical
strengths, decay if they aren't maintained


Just as linebackers get stronger day by day we will also get stronger
by revisiting the history or the basics or some classic guides.

>pencil-edit a magazine article. You won't
be learning new skills; you'll be building the strengths that make all
your skills possible.

>Unpredictable opponents, fast responses, dynamic situations—how
very much like life in business. Practicing these situations can be diffi-
cult on your own because by their nature they involve other people. If
you can get someone to help you practice a sales call or a negotiation,


Could also use web programmes

**Before the work**

Set goals

**During the work**

>. Elite runners, by contrast, focus intensely on themselves; among
other things, they count their breaths and simultaneously count their
strides in order to main- tain certain ratios

Extreme focus on oneself

>the key, as in all deliberate practice, is to choose a com- parison
that stretches you just beyond your current limits.

**Deepening your knowledge**

>If you set a goal of becoming
an expert on your business, you would immediately start doing all kinds
of things you don't do now. You would study the history of the business,
identify today's leading experts, read everything you could find, inter-
view people inside your organization and outside it who could provide
new perspectives, track key statistics and trends. The exact steps would
vary depending on your business, but it's quickly apparent that you
could make yourself impressively more knowledgeable about your busi-
ness than you are today, and probably do so in short order. With time,
your knowledge advantage over others would become large.

>As you add to your knowledge of your domain, keep in mind that
your objective is not just to amass information. You are building a men-
tal model—a picture of how your domain functions as a system. This
is one of the defining traits of great performers: They all possess large,
highly developed, intricate mental models of their domains.


### Chap 9 DP for innovation

There are two myths associated with creativity. A) that it happens
suddenly (to anyone) and B) too much knowledge inhibits creativity.

Both of these are sufficiently debunked by the author.

IF you look at A) sudden creativity

When studying 76 composers for their first glorious moment, or 131
painters, or 66 poets, the answer comes out to be the very similar. No
one produced anything that the world saw before 6 years and noone less
than 5 years.

>Hayes termed the long and absolutely typical preparatory period
"ten years of silence," which seemed to be required before anything
worthwhile could be produced


A good number of years is needed for sure. you can't escape those
initial years before achieving greatness.

> Professor Howard Gardner of Harvard wrote a book-length study
(Creating Minds) of seven of the greatest innova- tors of the early
twentieth century: Albert Einstein, T. S. Eliot, Sigmund Freud,
Mahatma Gandhi, Martha Graham, Pablo Picasso, and Igor Stravinsky.

>"I have been struck throughout this study by the operation of
the ten-year rule. . .. Should one begin at age four, like Picasso, one can
be a master by the teenage years; 

 The Newcomen engine wasn't very efficient, and Watt's design
was much more efficient. It was also, of course, a giant innovation that
through its role in the industrial revolution changed the course of his-
tory. But it was not some previously unimagined conception that burst
forth like a miracle. Just the opposite: It came about because Watt was
trying to improve on what already existed, the Newcomen engine, and
his long training as a maker of scientific instruments gave him the skills
and knowledge with which to do it.

Arguiing that too much knowledge blinds you seems liek there is no
eveidence to it. 

>The steam engine and cotton gin were two of the most significant
business innovations ever, and the stories of how such innovations
come about remain the same up until the present. From the telegraph to
the airplane to the Internet, they're all adaptations and extensions
of what existed, made possible by great insights but entirely
impossible without a deep knowledge of, and reliance on, past

>The idea of epiphany is a dreamer's paradise where
people want to believe that things are easier than they are.

This further states the necessity of domain specific knowledge to
create amazing things is very much necessary. especially if you want
to be one of the greats. This is exactly what we are looking at.


### Chap 10: Great performane in youth and Age

**The supporting environment**

Starting early certainly has its advantages. Some of the top
violinists coming from a well supported home have accumalated 10k
hours by the time they were 20 years old.

>In an organization this progression is analogous to choosing devel-
opmental assignments that continually stretch an employee's abilities.
Employees aren't children, but many of them, like children, will not
voluntarily keep seeking new work experiences that stress their weak-
est professional muscles;

> The research focused on the students' family environments,
evaluating them on two dimensions, stimulation and support. A
stimulating environment was one with lots of opportu- nities to learn
and high academic expectations. A supportive environ- ment was one
with well-defined rules and jobs, without much arguing over who had to
do what, and in which family members could rely on one another.

**Defying age**

Young pros develop even further with time

>Yo-Yo Ma was a world-famous cellist at age twenty, but he was much
better at forty. Jamie Dimon was an amazingly accomplished financial
services executive at age twenty-nine, but he was much better at
fifty, as CEO of JPMorgan Chase

>One of the best established and least surprising findings in psy-
chology is that as we age, we slow down. Remembering things, solving
unfamiliar problems—these take about twice as long in our sixties as
they did in our twenties. We move more slowly. Coordinating our arms
and legs is more difficult. We've all seen it happen, and anyone in
their thirties or beyond has experienced it. So we might reasonably
suppose that this unavoidable trend spells doom for excellent
performance. If our minds and bodies deteriorate with the march of
time, there would seem to be nothing we can do to maintain top-level
performance be- yond a certain number of years.

> Studies in a very broad range of domains—management, aircraft
piloting, music, bridge, and others—show consistently that excellent
performers suffer the same age-related declines in speed and general
cognitive abilities as everyone else—except in their field of
expertise.

This I think is the single most relevant outcome for me from this
book, that goes on to say something rather profound about how awesome
I can be at the age of 60. Barring outright physical problems I should
still be able to kill then just like...

> Psychologists measure how fast people can push a button in response
to a question on a screen or how fast they can tap their fingers or
coordinate finger movements; all these things slow down with age. But
while excellent pianists slowed down like everyone else in how fast
they could respond to a choice on a screen, which is not a skill that
makes much difference to a pianist, they didn't slow down at all when
it came to piano-related skills like finger tapping or finger
coordination. They could do those things as if they hadn't aged at
all. It's the same story in many other fields.

You will continue to suck only if you are an amateur with tons of
experience. You are not expected to suck as an expert who keeps doing
tons of DP. example: SCOOBY?

>Those expert pianists who maintained their piano skills as they aged
were compared with a sample of amateur pianists, some of whom had
forty years of experience but had long since given up anything that
could be called deliberate practice. The amateurs, unlike the experts,
suffered predictable, across-the-board age-related declines

>Wilhelm Backhaus said that in his fifties he increased his prac- tice
of etudes, which he felt he needed in order to maintain his techni-
cal skills. 

And Arthur Rubinstein played continued to perform publicly, to great
acclaim, until he was eighty-nine

>In baseball, Julio Franco played for the Atlanta Braves in the 2007
season at age forty-nine, thanks to a regimen of intense exercise and
carefully designed diet that's unlike anything that was used in
baseball decades ago. His trainer told the New York Times, "When I got
ac- quainted with him, I learned quickly that you can't associate him
with people of his age. His discipline is unlike anything I've ever
seen.

>and even some who improve, running faster at sixty than they did at
fifty. A seventy-four-year-old man in 2004 ran a marathon in 2:54:44,
which is four minutes faster than the gold medal performance in the
1896 Olympics


All this showing me that Son You will be rewarded, it was hard for
bruce wayne to do what he did every night, without any fame or
recognition, but he still could do it why? Waar ben je de Mathivanan?


>Our brains are perfectly able to add new neurons well into old age
when conditions demand it, and brain plasticity doesn't stop with
age. Give your brain the right kind of training—for example, by making
it try to do two things at once—and plasticity
will increase in the regions that normally show the greatest atrophy
in later years.

> Warren Buffett continues to run Berkshire Hathaway brilliantly in
his late sev- enties. Rupert Murdoch, at about the same age, is
aggressively expand- ing his huge media conglomerate, News
Corporation. 

>As Karl Malone, the NBA's second all-time top scorer, told the Los
An- geles Times about aging athletes, "It's not that their bodies
stop, it's just that they've decided to stop pushing it."

>Eventually, of course, everyone's performance declines. Even the
most diligent deliberate practice cannot fend off the advancing years
forever. When Arthur Rubinstein gave up performing publicly at eighty-
nine, it was because he was becoming blind and deaf. He couldn't prac-
tice his way past that. And then there's the ultimate slowing down,
which even the greatest performers must confront. Warren Buffett told
his shareholders in his 2008 letter, "I've reluctantly discarded the notion
of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death—abandoning
my hope to give new meaning to the term 'thinking outside the box."


>If it's all about the punishing demands of deliberate practice, the
continual, painful pushing beyond what's comfortable, for hours a day
and years on end, then why does anyone do it? A parent 185 Talent Is
Overrated can make a child practice, but not with the focus and
intensity needed to become great. Something else must make the child
do that.

>ves? Why does a chess player study four or five hours a day when
becoming even one of the world's top- ranked grand masters does not
necessarily bring wealth? Why do some young businesspeople push
themselves beyond their jobs' considerable daily demands to acquire
more knowledge and skills when the payoff is uncertain and may be
years away?

One of the most important and significant questions of the decade!

>Consider what Shizuka Arakawa had been through by the time she won
the gold medal in figure skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin,
Italy

>Ara- kawa's road to the gold medal involved at least twenty thousand
derri- ere impacts on an unforgiving surfac

**Two kinds**
Intrinsic and extrinsic

>The consistent finding reported by many researchers examining many
domains is that high creative achievement and intrinsic motivation go
together. Creative people are focused on the task (How can I 188 Where
Does the Passion Come From?  solve this problem?) and not on
themselves (What will solving this problem do for me?).

>People who rank high for intrinsic motivation on various
psychological tests consistently produce work that is judged more
crea- tive in studies. Conversely, as well

>The work of University of Chicago psychologist Mihaly Csikszent-
mihalyi suggests TED talk that high flow allows for hightened
satisfaction 

>This "high" is achieved when the challenge just matches
the person's skills;

>But the theory of deliberate practice keeps running up against a
minor real-world contradiction. In the theory, practice is "not
inherently enjoyable." Since it requires constantly trying to do
things one can't quite do, and thus failing repeatedly,

What could be so nice about running to the point of deep exhaustion or
falling 20k times on your fucking ass?

>But in the research, top-level performers, at least in sports, often
report the opposite. In studies of wrestlers, skaters, soccer play-
ers, field hockey players, and martial artists, practice activities
rated fairly high on a scale of enjoyableness.

But we have see what the Ericsson's violinists felt. They openly
stated or rated it as the most unenjoyable part. These kids were of
the age 9?

>But at a deeper level one has to sus-
pect that practice is somehow meeting an inner need for anyone who
can maintain it at an intense level for years. It seems plausible that the
role of practice in producing the highly enjoyable flow state could be
part of it.


>Studies on 19 0 Where Does the Passion Come From?  that small subset
have uncovered a wide range of driving forces, practi- cally all of
which are intrinsic. They may include a need for achieve- ment, a need
for power over others, even a need to do good in the world.  But the
drivers are almost never extrinsic, which makes sense when we observe
the most eminent executives and entrepreneurs; long after they've
accumulated more money than they could ever use and more fame than
anyone could hope for, they keep working and trying to get better.

Intrinsic drive seems the most powerful for success.

But,

>When Watson and Crick were
struggling to find the structure of DNA, they worked almost nonstop
because they knew they were in a race with other research teams. Al-
exander Graham Bell worked similarly on the telephone, knowing he
was in competition with Elisha Gray, whom he beat to the patent office
by just hours. 

>. Extrinsic motivators were of many types, not all of them
controlling, and some of them seemed to enhance
creativity. Specifically, extrinsic motivators that re- inforce
intrinsic motivation could work quite effectively. Like what?
Recognition that confirms competence turned out to be effective. While
the mere expectation of being judged tended to reduce creativity, per-
sonal feedback could actually enhance creativity if it was the right
kind—"constructive, nonthreatening, and work-focused rather than per-
son-focused," in Amabile's words. That is, feedback that helped a
person do what he or she felt compelled to do was effective. Even the
prospect of direct rewards, normally suffocating to creativity, could
be helpful if they were the right kinds of rewards—those "that involve
more time, freedom, or resources to pursue exciting ideas." These
findings prompted Amabile to revise her hypothesis: Intrinsic
motivation is still best, and extrinsic motivation that's controlling
is still detrimental to creativity, but extrinsic

>the main objectives of deliberate practice, sometimes benefits from
ex- trinsic motivators, especially in the early stages. Even the elite
perform- ers studied by Bloom required plenty of extrinsic motivation
when they were starting out in their field. Their parents made them
practice, as parents have always done, though it's interesting to note
that in these cases, when push came to shove and parents had to make a
direct threat, it frequently played off the student's intrinsic
motivators. So it wasn't "If you don't do your piano practice we'll
cancel your allowance," but rather "we'll sell the piano." Not "If you
don't go to swimming practice you'll be grounded Saturday night," but
rather "we'll take you off the team." If the child truly didn't care
about the piano or swimming, the threats wouldn't have worked.


>With time, however, "the students increasingly became responsible for
their own motivation," Bloom reports. They set their own goals. Ex-
trinsic motivators still played a role; students wanted to do well in
pub- lic performances or competitions. But in part that was because
doing so confirmed that they were making progress toward their goals,
which is what they really cared about. These events also brought the
students together with other top-level performers, so each student
could figure out "what he or she must still do to reach the highest
level of attainment possible." That is, the motivation wasn't just
acclaim for performing well, but, increasingly, the inner drive to be
the best.

**Organizations**

Evaluations at most companies are exactly the opposite: telling the
hapless employee what he did wrong, not how to do better, and
specifying personal traits (attitude, personality) that must be
changed, all under the unspoken looming threat of getting, fired.

**Auto-motivation**

Sometimes apparently there are cases where kids show amazing drive to
do something, like a 10 month old baby crying for paper and pen to
draw all the time. 

>While most children have to be made to practice, these chil-
dren can scarcely be restrained from it, and their performance is far
beyond their years. What do these very powerful stories tell us?

In some cases yes there is no explanation of where they get this
motivation from and apprently in most cases these kids don't really
reach tremendous heights.

>Conversely, the people who do become top-level achievers are rarely
child prodigies. That is certainly true in business; he early lives of
the Welches, Ogilvies, and Rockefellers almost never hint at the
success to come. Looking at more scientific research, this is one of
the most nota- ble findings in Bloom's large study, which examined
performers at the highest level—people who had achieved national or
international rec- ognition before age forty. For example, all of the
twenty-four pianists studied—each a finalist in at least one major
international competition, such as the Van Cliburn or the
Levintritt—had had lessons "forced upon them," in the words of the
study, just the opposite of the kids who seemed driven to sit at the
piano as toddlers. Similarly, in no case did the parents of the future
champion swimmers foresee their child's eventual achievements. Time
and again the story is the same: Even by age eleven or twelve it would
have been difficult to predict who the fu- ture exceptional performers
would be.

>One of the pianists recalled the life-changing
experience at age fifteen of sitting just three feet away as a great pianist
performed: "I remember feeling inundated and overwhelmed with the
dynamic range, with the expressive potential, with hearing the real bite
of the sound, the real softness of the sound. . . . at that point I became
serious like I never had before. I cut out horsing around at the piano. I
cut out sightreading for two hours a day just for the pleasure of it. I
worked."


>We've already seen that in domains where it's possible to start work
at an early age, such as music and sports, most future great
performers need to be pushed at first. In domains where building the
knowledge foundation takes 198 Where Does the Passion Come From?  many
years before specific domain-related work can begin, such as busi-
ness and high-level science, we commonly see that future stars may be
decidedly undriven even as young adults. That was obviously the case
with Steven Ballmer and Jeffrey Immelt sitting in their cubicle at
Procter & Gamble. Both young men went on to business school (Ballmer
to Stanford, Immelt to Harvard) and over time developed the drive to
work prodigiously hard, not just in general, but specifically at
building the particular skills that brought them to the top of the
corporate world.  Both men became famously focused workers.

**Multiplier effect**

Some spark seems to have started, just like the kid who started taking
piano seriously, some event or just even being better at something
else, sparks more and more interest to become better at it.

> In virtually every field, beginners can't manage more than an hour
of practice per day, and sometimes much less. But by the time they
become top performers, they've built 200 Where Does the Passion Come
From?  themselves up to handling four to five hours a day. It isn't
quite right to say only that the practice caused the performance or
that the perfor- mance helped support the practice. Over time, each
contributed to the other.


>What you want—really, deeply want—is fundamental because de- liberate
practice is a heavy investment. Becoming a great performer demands the
largest investment you will ever make—many years of your life devoted
utterly to your goal—and only someone who wants to reach that goal
with extraordinary power can make it. We often see the price people
pay in their rise to the top of any field; even if their marriages or
other relationships survive, their interests outside their 204 Where
Does the Passion Come From?  field typically cannot. Howard Gardner,
after studying his seven excep- tional achievers, noted that "usually,
as a means of being able to con- tinue work, the creator sacrificed
normal relationships in the personal sphere." Such people are
"committed obsessively to their work. Social life or hobbies are
almost immaterial." That may sound like admirable self-sacrifice and
direction of purpose, but it often goes much further, and it can be
ugly.

>As Gardner notes, "the self-confidence merges with egotism,
egocentrism, and narcissism: each of the creators seems highly
self-absorbed, not only wholly involved in his or her own projects,
but likely to pursue them at the cost of other individuals." The story
of the great achiever who leaves a wake of anger and betrayal is a
common one.  So what would it take for you to accept all of that in
pursuit of a goal? What would you want so much that you'd commit
yourself to the necessary hard, endless work, giving up relationships
and other inter- ests, so that you might eventually get it? Whatever
it is that the greatest performers want, that's how much they must
want it.

>Above all, what the evidence shouts most loudly is striking, lib-
erating news: that great performance is not reserved for a preordained
few. It is available to you and to everyone.


Pandian this is for you!


>Coordinating our arms
and legs is more difficult. We've all seen it happen, and anyone in their
thirties or beyond has experienced it. So we might reasonably suppose
that this unavoidable trend spells doom for excellent performance

the chapter and delivering one example to send the concept home. and
worst case some things that you cannot miss.

## Criticism

[Some psycologists from Michigan State University](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/opinion/sunday/sorry-strivers-talent-matters.html) seem to think
that Geoffs book is not presenting all the facts and give a few
examples of studies that might suggest that Geoff in his conclusion is
wrong. 

Geoff, constantly seems to be focusing on one thing and one thing
alone. What separates the greatest of the greats from normal folk. And
I suspect he has done a tremendous job of presenting the goddamn
evidence. 

The MSU professors of psychology, seem to be conveniently forgetting
that Geoff is primarily and only focusing on the greats, and their
rebuttal is anything but a rebuttal.

This book deals with the questions like, Is greatness achieved or
inate ?, and how anyone can achieve greatness. A completely
science-backed approach has been delivered by the author Geoffrey
Collin.

### The Mystery

When people think about Mozart, Tiger Woods, Federer they never really
imagine themselves ever getting to such a level of proficiency. They
often marvel at what the legends are doing or have done. And then move
on with their lives. They seem to suggest that such extraordinary
ability is a result of some inate ability or the right genes and push
it off as something that by chance happens to someone and go on with
their lives.

But What separates hard workers from the truly exceptional aka
world-class? Experience? Talent? Intelligence? Memory?

Many people work hard. Look at everyone you know right from your
parents to your siblings and even yourself. But just "working hard"
seems to be not enough to the greatest of the greats aka legend. 

If you look at experience, it does not look like the deciding factor
regarding this. Many studies by leading researchers (TIO chap 1) seem
to show a 0 correlation between experience and getting better, be it
with auditors, clinical psychologists and even surgeons.

> Auditors with years of experience were no better at detecting
> corporate fraud—a fairly important skill for an auditor—than were
> freshly trained rookies.

Talent certainly seems to be overrated. Talent refuses to show itself
even after many many years into the lives of exceptional musicians.

>In a study of outstanding American pianists, for example, you could
>not have pre- dicted their eventual high level of achievement even
>after they'd been training intensively for six years; at that point
>most of them still weren't standing out from their peers.

A standard argument that comes out of any such number of studies
presented is "But what about Mozart, and what about Tiger Woods?"

There seems to be an explanation for these so called anomalies. In
both the case of Mozart and Tiger woods their fathers seem to be
starting them off quite early in their lives and have spent quite some
time building the skill into their children. In the case of Mozart his
father was a highly accomplished pedagogue and in the case of Tiger
Woods, his father played golf quite well and was extremely passionate
about it and was also a teacher.

The question about talent is answered in the fact that his first piece
regarded today as a masterpiece was composed when he was 21. Although
it is an early age, it must be taken into account that the boy has
been in preparation since very very young. Also, current contempraries
(prodigies like mozart) seem to be doing much better than him owing
possibly to improved training methods while measured on a precocity
index (TOI, chap 2).

In Tigers case his father never really claimed any inborn talent, but
he thought that the boy seemed to grasp things rather quickly. And
both of them state Hard Work for the Success of Tiger. 

If you look at Jack Welsh, CEO General Electric, one of the twentieth
century's manager of the century apparently showed no inclination
towards busieness untill his midtwenties.

He finally started working in chemical developement operation at
GE. And apparently until that point there seems to be no point
indicating the business tycoon that he was going to become. 

If talent existed and refused to show itself even after so many years
of life, it beckons the statement if that inate ability (talent) even exists.
