## Actual summary plan

Write 200 words about each chapter. Simple? based on the key idea of
the chapter and delivering one example to send the concept home. and
worst case some things that you cannot miss.

## Criticism

[Some psycologists from Michigan State University](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/opinion/sunday/sorry-strivers-talent-matters.html) seem to think
that Geoffs book is not presenting all the facts and give a few
examples of studies that might suggest that Geoff in his conclusion is
wrong. 

Geoff, constantly seems to be focusing on one thing and one thing
alone. What separates the greatest of the greats from normal folk. And
I suspect he has done a tremendous job of presenting the goddamn
evidence. 

The MSU professors of psychology, seem to be conveniently forgetting
that Geoff is primarily and only focusing on the greats, and their
rebuttal is anything but a rebuttal.

## How to improve my life with DP

## Actual summary

This book deals with the questions like, Is greatness achieved or
inate ?, and how anyone can achieve greatness. A completely
science-backed approach has been delivered by the author Geoffrey
Collin.

### The Mystery

When people think about Mozart, Tiger Woods, Federer they never really
imagine themselves ever getting to such a level of proficiency. They
often marvel at what the legends are doing or have done. And then move
on with their lives. They seem to suggest that such extraordinary
ability is a result of some inate ability or the right genes and push
it off as something that by chance happens to someone and go on with
their lives.

But What separates hard workers from the truly exceptional aka
world-class? Experience? Talent? Intelligence? Memory?

Many people work hard. Look at everyone you know right from your
parents to your siblings and even yourself. But just "working hard"
seems to be not enough to the greatest of the greats aka legend. 

If you look at experience, it does not look like the deciding factor
regarding this. Many studies by leading researchers (TIO chap 1) seem
to show a 0 correlation between experience and getting better, be it
with auditors, clinical psychologists and even surgeons.

> Auditors with years of experience were no better at detecting
> corporate fraud—a fairly important skill for an auditor—than were
> freshly trained rookies.

### Talent is overrated

Talent certainly seems to be overrated. Talent refuses to show itself
even after many many years into the lives of exceptional musicians.

>In a study of outstanding American pianists, for example, you could
>not have pre- dicted their eventual high level of achievement even
>after they'd been training intensively for six years; at that point
>most of them still weren't standing out from their peers.

A standard argument that comes out of any such number of studies
presented is "But what about Mozart, and what about Tiger Woods?"

There seems to be an explanation for these so called anomalies. In
both the case of Mozart and Tiger woods their fathers seem to be
starting them off quite early in their lives and have spent quite some
time building the skill into their children. In the case of Mozart his
father was a highly accomplished pedagogue and in the case of Tiger
Woods, his father played golf quite well and was extremely passionate
about it and was also a teacher.

The question about talent is answered in the fact that his first piece
regarded today as a masterpiece was composed when he was 21. Although
it is an early age, it must be taken into account that the boy has
been in preparation since very very young. Also, current contempraries
(prodigies like mozart) seem to be doing much better than him owing
possibly to improved training methods while measured on a precocity
index (TOI, chap 2).

In Tigers case his father never really claimed any inborn talent, but
he thought that the boy seemed to grasp things rather quickly. And
both of them state Hard Work for the Success of Tiger. 

If you look at Jack Welsh, CEO General Electric, one of the twentieth
century's manager of the century apparently showed no inclination
towards busieness untill his midtwenties.

He finally started working in chemical developement operation at
GE. And apparently until that point there seems to be no point
indicating the business tycoon that he was going to become. 

If talent existed and refused to show itself even after so many years
of life, it beckons the statement if that inate ability (talent) even
exists.

**Could the explanation possibly be genetic?**

Oboe genes are almost certain they don't exist. 

>But practice proponents do not dispute the possibility that genes
> could play a role in a person's willingness to put himself or
> herself through the extremely rigorous demands of becoming an
> exceptional performer.


### Smartness: Intelligence and Memory

Maybe talent seems like it doesn't exist, but intelligence and memory
should probably have a high influence. For example, the top players
where they are because of their supreme intelligence or vast memory

**Intelligence**

A study was conducted in the business realm. Salesmen were an
attractive subject for this study as it is rather clear to measure
output/success. More number of sales more output. The study was the
largest of its kind containing data of several dozen studies amounting
to 45k individuals. Because of such a large number the endless sources
of noise are expected to be drowned. The bosses gave good indication
of the IQ of the person with their ratings and with the help of sales
they actually made, the results were compiled. 

>Intelligence was virtually useless in predicting how well a
>salesperson would perform. Whatever it is that makes a sales ace, it
>seems to be something other than brainpower.

Another investigation on real world performance is with betting of
horses. The goal was to forecast post-time odds. Based on this the
classification of experts and non-experts was done. Both groups seem
to have not much differences in terms of experience at the track,
years of formal education, and even the IQ averages and
variation. 

Further investigation suggested that IQ's didn't help predict if
someone was going to be good or bad at this. A person with IQ of 85
("dull normal") was able to pick out the top horse in 10/10 races. And
a nonexpert with IQ 118 picked up the top horse for 3/10 cases. 

There are a dozen factors that go into deciding the outcome of the
game, like how the horse fared in the last game, track condition
etc... Apparently the low-IQ-experts used far complex models that took
a wide consideration of multiple variables unlike the high-IQ-experts.


And this doesn't stop here. The same traits are observed with Chess,
GO and even scrabble. "Scrabble users below average results on tests
of verbal ability. And some Chess grand masters have IQ that are below Normal.

> IQ seems to be a decent predictor of performance on an unfamiliar
> task, but once a person has been at it for a few years, IQ predicts
> little or nothing about performance.


**And What about memory?**

> The Czech master Richard Reti once played twenty-nine blindfolded
>games simultaneously.

>Miguel Najdorf, a Polish-Argentinean grand
>master, played forty-five blindfolded games simultaneously in Sao
>Paulo in 1947;

Surely this is a sign of the Divine? Surprise, surprise! A study with
highly skilled chess players and non-experts in chess was done where
all were shown real chess game positions of 25 pieces for 5-10
seconds. The chess masters were able to recall the position of every
single piece, whereas the non-experts were able to recall 4 or 5
pieces. This was followed up with random placement of chess pieces and
the same 5-10 seconds to remember each piece. The chess masters and
the non-experts pretty much ended up with the same results. So,

>The chess masters did not have incredible memories. What they had was
>an incredible ability to remember real chess positions.

or 5-9 chunks of information on the chess board that allowed them to
recall the positions. Similarly even with GO and GOMUKU similar
results were achieved.

>Many decades of research have shown that average short-term memory
>holds only about seven items. The capacity of short-term memory
>doesn't seem to vary much from person to person; virtually everyone's
>short-term memory falls in the range of five to nine items.

As reflected later in the book (TOI, Chap 6), remembering 49 games at
once is still a ginormous feat not possible with this short term
memory. More on this later.

There are physical limitations to achievement. Death and
diseases, physical limitations (related to age, personal dimensions
etc...), are some of the things of physical limitations we might have
stopping us from becoming the greats. 

>Many decades of research have shown that average short-term memory
>holds only about seven items.  The capacity of short-term memory
>doesn't seem to vary much from person to person; virtually everyone's
>short-term memory falls in the range of five to nine items.

<!-- needs repair -->
Other than physical limitations, there is not really clearly
understood or proven non-physical constraints.


### Chap 4 a better IDEA

**Who is Jerry rice?**

> As every football fan knows, Jerry Rice was the greatest receiver in
> NFL history, and some football authorities believe he may have been
> the greatest player at any position.

He was great athlete while already in his senior year but was not NFL
material that all teams fought to sign him. 

>In the 1985 draft, fifteen teams passed him over before the San
>Francisco 49ers finally signed him.

Despite all this the legacy he has left behind him is truly
remarkable.

>For some future player to perform at such an extremely high standard
>for so many years in a physically brutal game is obviously not
>impossible, but history sug- gests that it is unlikely

**What makes him different?**

He always did more. During workouts after catching a pass rice would
sprint to the end zone unlike his other team mates. He would typically
continue practicing by long after the rest of the team left. 

His off-season trainings were so hard that the workouts were not
shared with other teams not because it was confidential, but because
it would possibly cause harm to them. He spent way more time than his
colleagues with his workouts which he completely conducted on his
own. He always seemed to do strenuous cardio and weight
training. People who joined him for these workouts would stop midway
because they got sick. These workouts were considered the most
demanding in the league.

He trained for specific things that was most important for his
success. He knew he could not sprint fast, but then he trained on
other aspects which resulted in speed not making much of a different. 

He defied age limits.

>Wide receivers, who run like hell on most plays and frequently get
>crushed by tacklers, aren't supposed to last twenty sea- sons or
>play until age forty-two. None but Rice has ever done so.

**The crucial finding on what seems to matter**

A study of 3 violin groups from a school, rated by their teachers into
three categories based on their skill level, shows some interesting
insights. Group A and B were the exceptional and the good
performers. Group C were people from a department in the same school
which admitted far less talented students who would become researchers
or teachers. 

All groups were alike, performing a spending similar amount of time in
total for activities such as lessons, practice, exams etc... All
subjects were of the same age as well. 

After a through study it was discovered that groups A and B spent
equal number of hours in practice/week by themselves whereas group C
spent much lesser time in doing this. But this quite did not answer
why Group A and B were so different. Upon a deeper look it was found
that the total accumulated hours of lifetime practice for Group A was
\>7k hours, for group B was 5k hours and for group C it was 3k hours. 

>No matter who they were, or what explanation of their performance was
>being advanced, it always took them many years to become excellent,
>and if a person achieves elite status only after many years of toil,
>assigning the principal role in that success to innate gifts becomes
>problematic, to say the least.

There seems to be a similar trend in other fields as well. For
example, many scientists and authors produce their greatest work only
after twenty or more years of devoted effort. We see that practice
seems key. But researchers think it is much more than that.

>The vast majority of people we work with, or play golf with, or play
>Doom with, got better for a while and then leveled off, having
>apparently reached the limit of their abilities; years of further
>work have not made them any better. On the other hand, we see
>repeatedly that the people who have achieved the most are the ones
>who have worked the hardest. How can both sets of observations be
>true?

Simple practice makes perfect is not enough. These top performers seem
to be doing something more.


### What is deliberate practice and what isn't

Sometimes I go to basketball practice and try a few shots from one
spot. Then I try some drills in ball handling to improve play during
the game. I try multiple variations 2-3 times and get bored and then
play some one-on-ones with someone and feel happy that I have clocked
2 more hours of practice that gets me to amazing levels someday. You
know Practice makes perfect. The author hoists a similar example from
his life with golf balls and says with conviction that this will do
jack shit to your performance. 

The idea of deliberate practice (DP) is quite different from the above form
of practice. Jerry Rice according to the author a near perfect example
of someone who did massive amounts of DP and in the end became legend.

>Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
>examining. It is activity designed specifically to improve
>performance, often with a teacher's help; it can be repeated a lot;
>feedback on results is continuously available; it's highly demanding
>mentally, whether the activity is purely intellectual, such as chess
>or business-related activities, or heavily physical, such as
>sports; and it isn't much fun.

**It's designed specifically to improve performance.**

One must identify certain sharply defined elements that need
improvement and work on them intently. These practices should be
designed in such a way that they stretch your current abilities.

Apparently the great performers, see a couple of issues and isolate
each one of them and work on them until they have seen sufficient
improvement before moving on to the next aspect. 

It is recommended by the author that they are done with the guidance
of a teacher. In case we think that we have outgrown the benefits of a
teachers help, the author suggests to atleast give it another thought.

While learning we want to be in the zone where we are just beyond our
comfort zone which makes it slightly more motivating than other tasks
that might be daunting to even approach.

**It can be repeated a lot**

In golf the ball rarely gets buried into the sand. Such shots are
rare, that they happen but when they happen you cannot expect to
perform well as you have rarely performed that shot. Top performers
repeat a lot. Isolation of the specific space where you need to
improve is key followed by a lot of repetitions. 

>Ted Williams, baseball's greatest hitter, would practice hit-
>ting until his hands bled. Pete Maravich, whose college basketball
>records still stand after more than thirty years, would go to the gym
>when it opened in the morning and shoot baskets until it closed at
>night.

Following all this, one can work on his technique but it very
important to see progress and get feedback. Otherwise one will stop
getting any better and stop caring. Feedback is crucial to motivation.

Sometimes results might need interpretation, trusting your own
judgment might not really be the best way to go about it. For
example, Paul Graham, before he publishes a post, gets tons of
feedback of from his friends, corrects his article by himself several
times before publishing it. 

These tasks whether physical or not, seem to drain out much of our
mental energy as they are all about improving an unsatisfactory
performance and trying your hardest to improve these. It is estimated
that 4-5 hours of DP seems to be the upper limit, across disciplines,
with sessions frequently lasting no more than 90 minutes. The study of
violinists (TOI chap 4) for example shows that the kids that do DP
slept more not only during the night but also during the afternoons.

<!-- I remember exactly a year back when an STM said to me that he
doesn't --> <!-- need anyone to push him anymore and that he is
counting his hours of --> <!-- practice and finally that he was aiming
for 5 hours -->

**It is painful**

I can imagine working on say things like my sentence construction. I
know I make shit sentences. First I would need to identify good
sentences and try to work on my previous works trying to improve say
sentence by sentence. This could be qualified as DP. But the shear
repulsion to that activity plus the fact that I have to do it makes it
painful. Say with 10k sentences I could be better (of course
I could design some nice feedback around it), it is going to take
quite some time. 

Everyone would achieve greatness if it were easy and fun. But everyone
doesn't and it is not easy and fun. Your willingness to do it will
distinguish you all the more. Think about Jerry Rice again! 

**A dramatic example**

"Laszlo Polgar, a Hungarian educational psychologist, formed the view
in the 1960s that great performers are made, not born.", says the
author. Laszlo married with the intention of using his own kids as the
experiment and raised 3 women to become top level chess players. All
kids were home schooled and made to do DP. There was sufficient
material for study on chess by that time and that is one of the
reasons why chess was chosen.  

All three were great players, but only one is the current world number
1 woman player. It is known within the family that Judith is the one
that worked the hardest and it seems to show. The other two started
having other interests or drifted off from the game.

### Some characteristics of Extraordinary people aka how DP works

**DP'ers perceive more**

DPer's know where to look and where to get more information. If you
consider typewriters, in order to improve speed they look further into
the text and move their fingers in a way to make more speed
happen. Doctors look at X-rays and see far from it than simpler
folk. They understand the significance of the indicators that average
performers don't even notice. Top Tennis players look at the hips and
shoulders of servers to know where the ball is going to go.


**Knowing more**

>You didn't really have to know much about a field if you knew the
>best ways to analyze a problem and think it through, and you needed
>to know even less if your analysis and reasoning power could be
>juiced by a computer

But still the time of computers beating humans hadn't arrived until
recently. Be it in chess or GO. What was missing was the vast
knowledge of the particular positions in different cases and what sort
of choices had what sort of consequences. 

In chess apparently, master-level players posses chess knowledge by a
factor of 10-100 comparted to good club-level players. 

**Remembering more**

Earlier we saw that people in general are capable of holding 5-9
chunks in their head. This is the short-term memory that is being
talking about. In the study of remembering the max number of pieces
and their positions, the chess-masters were able to recollect every
single piece. But, when it came to random arrangements they were as
good as the control group.

This can be imagined like letters and words. Given a word it is easier
to remember if it is familiar and with little effort we can spell it
backwards even, but if the letters are in a random order it is going
to be pretty hard. What chess players could be seeing is words.

And with a rich vocabulary of such words (positions of groups of
pieces), they seem to be doing much more. Apparently researchers have
estimated that good club players have a vocabulary of 100-1000
"words", but a master-level player has a vocabulary of 1k-10k
"words". 

Holding 49 chess games in memory seems to be much more than the short
term memeory. 

>All these people have developed what we might call a memory skill, a
>special ability to get at long-term memory, with its vast capacity,
>in a fast, reliable way. They aren't using short-term memory or
>traditionally defined long-term memory.

A type of memory that becomes better and better over more DP and one
that allows you to retrieve more information or provides hooks for you
to add your information to, more like connections.

A study involving a description of a football game and 2 sets of
people demonstrates this. The description was shown to fans of the
game and random people. After some time recalling the details of the
game was the task. The fans were able to recall the important parts of
the game about who passed to who and the sequence of events, where as
the control group remembered trivial things like when the crowd roared
etc... 

>The fans' high-level knowledge of the game provided a frame- work on
>which to hang the information they had read.

>In the letters-versus-words analogy, it isn't just that novices see
>letters while experts see words; the experts also know the meanings
>of the words.  It's clear that the superior memory of great
>performers doesn't just happen. Since it is built on deep
>understanding of the field, it can be achieved only through years of
>intensive study. It further requires con- sistently relating new
>information to higher-level concepts, which is hard work.

**Changes to physical structure**

The influence of DP on DPer's is even more impressive that the body
actually gets modified in the process. Changes to the body, the brain,
the heart even, can happen to aid you in your field, for you to create
the right type of hooks on which you can hang the wide amount of knowledge.

>En- durance runners, for instance, have larger than average hearts,
>an attribute that most of us see as one of the natural advantages
>with which they were blessed

> Athletes can change not just the size of their
muscles but even the composition of them (the proportion of fast-twitch
fibers to slow-twitch) through years of practice

>The brain's ability to change is greatest in youth, but it doesn't
>end there

The bottomline being that there is path that exists, that runs between
your current abilities to that of of the greats. It is hard, extremely
long and demanding. Not many will follow it all the way till the end.
### Chap 7: applying to our lives

**Know what you want to be**

To begin with you need to know where you want to go. Do you want to be
the greatest basketball player you can be? Do you want to able to
reason and solve problems like an STM? Do you want to be the best at
your work? Do you want huge-ass muscles? Do you want to be amazing
in Data Science? Do you want very good at analyzing problems and
performing research on that (as would be needed by GiveWell)? Do you
want to be able to communicate ideas better?

>The skills and abilities one can choose to develop are infinite, but
>the opportunities to practice them fall into two general categories:
>op- portunities to practice directly, apart from the actual use of the
>skill or ability, the way a musician practices a piece before
>performing it; and opportunities to practice as part of the work
>itself.

So for example, if you look at chess, you can study positions and make
a move and compare it to what and why the grand masters did it. This
is Practicing directly. Another way of DP could be to actually just
play games online and get practice as a result of that.

<!-- filler?-->

**The music model**

When you want to get better at playing an instrument better, you can
think of all the ways it could be done much better. You could improve
on say the trill, or the speed or your knowledge of arpeggios or
coordination of both the hands etc... You look at each aspect. It is
probably easy to isolate and practice them. You can get feedback
looking at the tempo of improvement or from your coach or even watch a
video of yourself.

Thus the music model, where you can see what aspects need
improvement, isolate them and practice them. 

The same thing can be applied to even for real interviews. In essence
it is similar as the key messages are going to be conveyed regardless
of the questions. Here you could look at aspects such as your humour,
your passion, logical flow of thoughts (for example using STAR
method), and the actual messages being delivered well. Feedback from
a mock interview with a friend or recording your self could help. 

For written work, it is probably best to emulate the method of one of
the best writers (as viewed by many) Benjamin Franklin. Here key
aspects to work on could be, grammar, elegance of expression,
perspicuity, organization, vocabulary etc... Benjamin Franklin (BF)
worked on his writing as a result of the feedback from his dad. For
some reason that motivated him to take on DP despite having little
time in addition to the work he was doing.

BF took the best work he could find and wrote down the meaning of each
sentence. A few days later, he would use these notes to form
sentences. And then he compared the original and his work, discovered
some faults and corrected them. His method was thus, look at what
needs to be improved (identify key aspect), try to forcibly write (DP)
and compare with the original. This he seems to have done multiple
times working on every single aspect of his writing. BF used the
Spectator. 

> instead of emulating the Spectator,
> you would choose a superior letter to the shareholders, advertisement,
> blog entry, or other appropriate model.

**The chess model**

In chess isolation of an aspect seems a little out of hand, as key
aspects are probably hard to find. But, with chess, thousands of books
on different positions, different games have been published. The DP
routine would be to look at a particular position and choose a move
and compare it to the move chosen by the master.

Business is like chess. You are presented with a position of a problem
and need to figure out the best move. Even though it is sometimes hard
to evaluate which of the proposed solutions is better, the process of
focusing on the problem and evaluating solutions is in itself
instructive. This is called the case method and apparently Harvard
graduates would have done >500 cases by the time they graduate.

> You might work in marketing for years and get only a couple of
>chances to market U.S. products in China, for ex- ample, so that's a
>skill you probably wouldn't be very good at. But in a short time you
>could study a dozen cases about marketing U.S. products in Our Lives
>in China. That's one step removed from actually marketing the
>products, but it puts you many steps ahead of anyone who has not
>studied that specific skill intensely and repeatedly


**The sports model**

The practice of athletes falls into two aspects in the sports
model. One is conditioning, things that make allow you to perform
certain activities better. If you played NFL, you need speed, and
muscles (for explosiveness). Tennis players work on stamina so that
they can still play at the 3rd hour of the game. The other practice is
working on critical skills like batting the baseball, or serving the
tennis ball in certain locations or hitting the golf ball out of the
sand. The difference between other models and this is that no 2
situations will be exactly the same. The variability plays a huge
role. Every time you pass, the ball in NFL, the positioning of each
player will be different. For a pianist the Beethoven stays the same no
matter what.

For conditioning in information and service based work, its probably
about getting stronger with the underlying cognitive skills; basic
math and accounting for financing, basic science for people in
engineering etc...

>For people who write and edit, the same applies to Fowler's Modern
>English Usage and Strunk and White's The Elements of Style.

There are classic guides available for every field and revisiting them
is one way of improving conditioning. Conditioning can also be done on
new material. Pencil editing a new article, analyzing the basic ratios
of an unfamiliar financial statement etc...

The second type of practice is based on focused simulation. Sometimes
it is difficult to engage in a lot of this practice due to
unpredictable opponents, fast responses and dynamic situations. But it
should still be possible to bat the baseball and swing the golf club or
shoot the ball into the basketball ring, while focusing on high
repetition and immediate feedback.


**For work**

Yes if we would like to become an expert in our field we would read
tons about our field, the history, read everything that the experts
are doing, get insights from colleagues etc... But the goal is to gain
a lot of knowledge about the domain, but not just to just amass
information. The point is that we would like to build a mental model
of how the domain functions. That is the crucial picture.

>This is one of the defining traits of great performers: They all
>possess large, highly developed, intricate mental models of their
>domains.

### DP for innovation

It appears that even being creative is not not possible with DP. Two
myths associated with creativity are a) that it happens suddenly (to
anyone) and b) too much knowledge inhibits creativity. 

**Sudden Creativity**

Although all fields require creativity, some fields in which people
are expected to be really creative are poets, composers and
painters. When Studying 76 composers or 131 painters or even 66 poets,
for their first glorious moment, the answer comes out to be
similar. Within the first years no one produced had their first
glorious moment. With composers it took more than 10 years for most of
them. It seems that you cannot escape the initial years before
achieving greatness.

>Professor Howard Gardner of Harvard wrote a book-length study
>(Creating Minds) of seven of the greatest innova- tors of the early
>twentieth century: Albert Einstein, T. S. Eliot, Sigmund Freud,
>Mahatma Gandhi, Martha Graham, Pablo Picasso, and Igor Stravinsky.

The ten year rule seems to be prevalent irrespective of the field.

**Too much knowledge**

Watt was responsible for the industrial revolution with his giant
innovation. The Newcomen engine wasn't very efficient, but it was
already there, before Watt improved it. The impact of Watt is not at
question here but the point is that there was no sudden spark. Watt's
training as a maker of scientific instruments gave him the skills and
knowledge with which to do it. A similar story occurs with the
innovation of the cotton gin as well. 

>From the telegraph to the airplane to the Internet, they're all
>adaptations and extensions of what existed, made possible by great
>insights but entirely impossible without a deep knowledge of, and
>reliance on, past achievements.

Domain specific knowledge seems key in becoming one of the greats,
however way you see it.





### Great performance in your and age

**Supporting environment**

Starting early certainly has its advantages. You have more time in
your hands, less responsibilities to work on the things important to
you. It is quite possible to acquire 10k hours before reaching 20
years.

Apparently the role of environment is much higher than we
think. Research conducted informs that adolescents are able to sustain
concentrated effortful study (important for DP), in certain
environments characterized as stimulating and supporting environments.

>had to do what, and in which family members could rely on one
>another.

**Defying age**

Research has established quite well that as we age we slow
down. Things such as remembering, solving unfamiliar problems take
twice as much time as young people. Even coordinating the arms and
legs becomes difficult. 

But, Yo-Yo Ma was a world-famous cellist at age twenty who became even
better at 40. Studies in broad range of fields show consistently that
excellent performers (be it in piloting, music, bridge, management),
seem to suffer from the same age-related issues as everyone else,
**except in their domain.** 

This is probably one of the most important outcomes in research. This
fills me with immense joy to know that I don't have to be lame when I
am old and that I can still be thriving atleast in things where I
perform excellently. I immediately recollect the image of Scooby, who
60 years of age and still has the physique of a killer body builder
and endurance of 30 year old. Expert much!

Psychologists measured the response speeds of some old pianists by checking
how fast they could tap their fingers to a choice in the screen. This
was slow as expected. But when the same pianists  were given piano
related tasks like finger taping or finger coordination, they didn't
seem to have slow down at all. 

Corollory: More DP will result in you not sucking with old age.

Arthur Rubinstein continued to perform publicly to great acclaim,
until he was eighty nine. Julio Franco (baseball) played in the 2007
season at age 49, owing to his regimen of intense exercise and diet. A
seventy-four-year-old man in 2004 ran 4 minutes faster than the gold
medal performance of 1896 Olympics.

Eventually of course the age catches on. Warren Buffett has decided to
retire. Arthur Rubinstein gave up performing publicly at eighty-nine
because he was becoming deaf and blind. 

But what pushes them so far, with the continual practice, painful
pushing beyond what's comfortable, for many hours a day and years on
end? Why do chess grand masters continue to work for 4-5 hours a day
studying chess position when it does not necessarily bring wealth?

### Where does passion come from?

In essence Shizuka Arakawa, a figure skater, during her practice had
fallen on her ass 20000 times atleast before she finally won the gold
medal for Olympics in 2006. But why?

**Two kinds of motivation**

There are two kinds of motivation. One is the intrinsic kind and the
other is the extrinsic kind. Motivated by factors from within such as
the need to achieve, the need to power over others, even the need to
do good in the world, are intrinsic motivators. Extrinsic motivators
motivate us extrinsically such as the need for money. What Shizuka
Arakawa had seems to be the intrinsic.  

Intrinsic motivation and high creative achievement go hand in hand
according to research. A wide range of creative achievers seem to be
devoted to great questions or problems in their field and feel driven
to pursue them for decades. 

But how can something that is not fun at all (as we have seen until
now) be intrinsically motivating? Mihaly Csikszentmihali suggests a
mechanism that connects the intrinsic motivation and demands of
DP. His work on "flow" suggests a state where time slows down,
enjoyment is heightened and the painfulness of the task becomes not
observable. When the tasks are easy then it gets boring. When tasks
involved are challenging enough that they just stretch us beyond our
skills, then we are in flow. If it gets too challenging then we get
frustrated. 

Top-level performers in sports seem to rate practice high on the scale
of enjoyableness. But the violinists seen in Ericsson's study seem to
rank it as not enjoyable. The sharp contrast continues.

Extrinsic motivation however is expected to not get people to the
greatest heights. But, 

>When Watson and Crick were struggling to find the structure of DNA,
>they worked almost nonstop because they knew they were in a race with
>other research teams. Al- exander Graham Bell worked similarly on the
>telephone, knowing he was in competition with Elisha Gray, whom he
>beat to the patent office by just hours.

Not all extrinsic motivators are bad. Extrinsic motivators that
re-enforces intrinsic motivation could still work effectively.

>effective.

These extrinsic motivators that re-enforce the intrinsic motivation
benefit kids especially in the early stages. Parents instead of
saying,"if you don't practice we'll cancel your allowance," seemed to
say "if you don't practice we'll take the piano away". Of course this
worked only the child cared about the piano. With time the students
become responsible for their own motivation.

Sometimes apparently there are cases where kids show amazing drive to
do something, like a 10 month old baby crying for paper and pen to
draw all the time. Although, the people who do become top-level
achievers are rarely child prodigies. This is certainly true in
business, if you look at the early lives of Welches, Ogilvies, and
Rockefellas. There was no hint at the success that was about to
come.

Some spark seems to have started, just like in the kid who started
taking piano seriously, once he saw at close range an actual pianist
performing.


**Summary**

Becoming the greatest involves a large investment of time and
resources. The price people often pay to rise to the top of any
field are quite high.

>Howard Gardner, after studying his seven excep- tional achievers,
noted that "usually, as a means of being able to con- tinue work, the
creator sacrificed normal relationships in the personal sphere." Such
people are "committed obsessively to their work. Social life or
hobbies are almost immaterial." That may sound like admirable
self-sacrifice and direction of purpose, but it often goes much
further, and it can be ugly.

### Application

Chapters 1,2,3 are all about what defines you and how it is not
relevant to the picture of success. Chapter 4 talks about DP the
number of hours the violinists used and why this is so important. It
also talks about Jerry Rice and why he might be the greatest. 

Chapter 5 thoroughly talks about what is and isn't DP., Chap 6 is not
relevant to application. Chap 7 is about applying it with the three
models and thats it.

Chapter 8 just focusses on debunking myths.

Chapter 9 is about age and tells you why you need to DP like a bitch.

Chap 10 attempts to talk about passion but does not provide anything
fruitful. But I think I shall go with the idea of mihally. thats it.


So basically Chap 4, 5, and 7 that are about the principles.

### Application

**Knowing what you want to be**

I recently in this post realize that working at an EAO is highly
impactful. I have also seen other careers but I decided I was going to
work on DS for EAO, simultaneously applying to 80k!

Should I reconsider or revsit them? later!

1) But if that is the case, I want to get unbelievble knowledge of
statistics, the knowhow of the system.

2) I want to be able to write
really well. Like those guys who present arguments in 80k hours. Those
are the skill that will get be hired in the fields of EAO and DS.

3) I want to be in motherfucking exceptional health 

Weightraining and cardio and diet.

4) Be exceptionally good at one sport so that I can play it at a high
level and enjoy even when I am old. I suck at many things in
BB. Primarily shooting. I want to improve it a lot. BB is a sport that
I would like to keep playing well into my oldage. Or move to
badminton!
