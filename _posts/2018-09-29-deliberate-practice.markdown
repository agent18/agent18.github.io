## Mission

**Mission:** Write a 3k-word summary of the book "Talent is Overrated"
showing how to apply its techniques to at least three important,
real-world problems. Mission duration: 1 week.

## Summary

**Book name:** *"Talent is overrated: What Really Separates World-Class
Performers from Everybody Else"*

This book primarily deals with answering the question, "Are geniuses
born or made?". A completely science-backed approach has been
delivered by the author, Geoffrey Collin. Following is the summary.


### The Mystery

When people think about Mozart, Tiger Woods, Federer they never really
imagine themselves ever getting to such a level of proficiency. They
often marvel at how the legends do their activity so well, and then
move on with their lives. But what separates hard workers from the
truly exceptional aka world-class? Is it hard-work? Experience?
Talent? Intelligence? Memory? Luck?

Most of us think we work hard. Look at everyone you know right from your
parents to your siblings and even yourself. Just "working hard" seems
to not cut it become the greatest of the greats aka legend. 

If you look at experience, it certainly does not look like the
deciding factor regarding this. Many studies by leading researchers
(TIO Chapter 1) seem to show a 0 correlation between experience and
skills irrespective of the field (be it with auditors, clinical
psychologists and even surgeons).

> Auditors with years of experience were no better at detecting
> corporate fraud—a fairly important skill for an auditor—than were
> freshly trained rookies.


### Talent is overrated

Talent we imagine is something that people are born with.  Talent
certainly seems to be overrated especially when it refuses to show
itself even after many many years into the lives of exceptional
musicians.

>In a study of outstanding American pianists, for example, you could
>not have predicted their eventual high level of achievement even
>after they'd been training intensively for six years; 

A standard argument that comes at any such number of studies presented
is, "But what about Mozart, and what about Tiger Woods?"

There seems to be an explanation for these so called anomalies. In
both the case of Mozart and Tiger woods their fathers seem to be
starting them off quite early in their lives and have spent quite some
time building the skill into their children. In the case of Mozart his
father was a highly accomplished pedagogue and in the case of Tiger
Woods, his father played golf quite well and was extremely passionate
about it and was also a teacher.

The question about talent is answered in the fact that Mozart's first
piece regarded today as a masterpiece was composed when he
was 21. Although it is an early age, it must be taken into account
that the boy has been in preparation since very very young. In an
attempt to compare how Mozart fares with his current contemporaries,
Scientists created a 'precocity index'. This roughly measures how much
better someone is compared to the average. Mozart scored a thirteen
percent on the precocity index whereas his current contemporaries
scored thirty to five-hundred percent. This is probably due to the improved
methods in teaching and learning.

In Tiger's case his father never really claimed any inborn talent, but
he thought that the boy seemed to grasp things rather quickly. And
both of them state Hard Work for the Success of Tiger. 

If you look at Jack Welsh, CEO General Electric, one of the twentieth
century's manager of the century apparently showed no inclination
towards business until his mid-twenties. He started working in
chemical development operation at GE around that time. And until that
point there seems to be nothing indicating the business tycoon that he
was going to become. Talent Waar ben jij?

If talent existed and refused to show itself even after so many years
of life, it beckons if inate ability (talent) even exists.

### Smartness: Intelligence and Memory

Maybe talent seems like it doesn't exist, but surely intelligence and
memory power should have a high influence. Spoiler Alert! Nope.

**Intelligence**

A study was conducted in the business realm. Salesmen were an
attractive subject for this study as it is rather clear to measure
output/success. More number of sales implies more success. The study
was the largest of its kind containing data of several dozen studies
amounting to 45k individuals. Because of such a large number the
endless sources of noise are expected to be drowned. The bosses gave
good indication of the IQ of the person with their ratings, and with
the help of sales they actually made, the results were compiled.

>Intelligence was **virtually useless** in predicting how well a
>salesperson would perform. Whatever it is that makes a sales ace, it
>seems to be something other than brainpower. 

Another investigation on real world performance was with betting of
horses. The goal was to forecast post-time odds. Based on this the
classification of experts and non-experts was done. Both groups seem
to have not much differences in terms of experience at the track,
years of formal education, and even the IQ averages and
variation. Further investigation suggested that IQ's didn't help
predict if someone was going to be good or bad at this. A person with
IQ of 85 ("dull normal") was able to pick out the top horse in 10/10
races. And a non-expert with IQ 118 picked up the top horse for 3/10
cases. There are a dozen factors that go into deciding the outcome of
the game, like how the horse fared in the last game, track condition
etc... Apparently the low-IQ-experts used far complex models that took
a wide consideration of multiple variables unlike the high-IQ-non-experts.


And this doesn't stop here. The same traits are observed with Chess,
GO and even scrabble. "Scrabble users show below average results on tests
of verbal ability.", And some Chess grand masters have IQ that are
below Normal. All in all,

> IQ seems to be a decent predictor of performance on an unfamiliar
> task, but once a person has been at it for a few years, IQ predicts
> little or nothing about performance. 

**And what about memory?**

> The Czech master Richard Reti once played twenty-nine blindfolded
>games simultaneously.  
>Miguel Najdorf, a Polish-Argentinean grand
>master, played forty-five blindfolded games simultaneously in Sao
>Paulo in 1947; 

Surely this is a sign of the Divine, right? Surprise, surprise! A
study with highly skilled chess players and non-experts in chess was
done where all were shown real chess game positions of 25 pieces for
5-10 seconds. The chess masters were able to recall the position of
every single piece, whereas the non-experts were able to recall 4 or 5
pieces. As expected. This was followed up with random placement of
chess pieces and the same 5-10 seconds to remember each piece. The
chess masters and the non-experts pretty much ended up with the same
results.

>The chess masters did not have incredible memories. What they had was
>an incredible ability to remember real chess positions. 

Experts remembered about 5-9 chunks of information at a time on the
chess board that allowed them to recall the positions of the
pieces. The same was observed with GO and Gomuku even.

>Many decades of research have shown that average short-term memory
>holds only about seven items. The capacity of short-term memory
>doesn't seem to vary much from person to person; virtually everyone's
>short-term memory falls in the range of five to nine items. 

As reflected later in the book (TIO, Chap 6), remembering 49 games at
once is still a ginormous feat not possible with this short term
memory. More on this later.

Up until now it might seem that we are just unstoppable forces who can
all become legends. But certainly there are limitations. There are
physical limitations to achievement such as Death and diseases,
limitations related to age, personal dimensions etc... It appears that
other the physical limitations, there is not really clearly understood
or proven non-physical inate abilities inhibiting our potential to
success.

### A better Idea

**Who is Jerry rice?**

> As every football fan knows, Jerry Rice was the greatest receiver in
> NFL history, and some football authorities believe he may have been
> the greatest player at any position.

He was a great athlete while already in his senior year but was not
NFL level good, that all teams fought to sign him.

>In the 1985 draft, fifteen teams passed him over before the San
>Francisco 49ers finally signed him.

Despite all this the legacy he has left behind him is truly
remarkable.

>For some future player to perform at such an extremely high standard
>for so many years in a physically brutal game is obviously not
>impossible, but history suggests that it is unlikely.

**What makes him different?**

He always did more. During workouts after catching a pass rice he
would sprint to the end zone unlike his other team mates who would
only trot. He would typically continue practicing long after the rest
of the team left. His off-season trainings were even more
serious. These workouts were not shared with other teams not because
it was confidential, but because it would possibly cause harm to them,
as they were extremely grueling. He spent way more time than his
colleagues with his workouts which he completely conducted on his
own. The workouts involved a lot strenuous cardio and weight training for
long hours. People who joined him for these workouts would stop midway
because they got sick. These workouts were considered the most
demanding in the league.

He trained for specific things that was most important for his
success. He knew he could not sprint fast, but then he trained on
other aspects which resulted in speed not making much of a
difference. And he certainly defied age limits.

>Wide receivers, who run like hell on most plays and frequently get
>crushed by tacklers, aren't supposed to last twenty seasons or
>play until age forty-two. None but Rice has ever done so.

Is this the recipe for greatness? Is it about working harder than the
hardest? What matters?

**The crucial finding on what seems to matter**

A study of 3 violin groups from a school, rated by their teachers into
three categories based on their skill level, shows some interesting
insights. Group A and B were the exceptional and the good
performers. Group C were students from a department in the same school
which admitted far less talented students who would become researchers
or teachers. All groups were alike, with same age, spending similar amount
of time in total for activities such as lessons, practice, exams
etc...

After a thorough study it was discovered that groups A and B spent
equal number of hours in practice by themselves per/week by
themselves, whereas group C spent much lesser time in doing this. This
seems to explain why Group A and B were much better than group C. But
this quite did not answer why Group A and B were so different. Upon a
deeper look it was found that the total accumulated hours of lifetime
practice for Group A was \>7k hours, for group B was 5k hours and for
group C it was 3k hours. Such trends are not akin to violinists alone
further re-enforcing that talent is a lost concept. "No matter who
they are or what explanation of their performance was being advanced,
it always took them many years to become excellent." For example, many
scientists and authors produce their greatest work only after twenty
or more years of devoted effort. We see that practice seems key. But
researchers think it is much more than that. But,

>The vast majority of people we work with, or play golf with, or play
>Doom with, got better for a while and then leveled off, having
>apparently reached the limit of their abilities; years of further
>work have not made them any better. On the other hand, we see
>repeatedly that the people who have achieved the most are the ones
>who have worked the hardest. How can both sets of observations be
>true?

Simple 'practice makes perfect' seems to be not enough. These top
performers seem to be doing something more.

### What is deliberate practice and what isn't

Sometimes I go to basketball practice and try a few shots from one
spot. Then I try some drills in ball handling to improve play during
the game. I try multiple variations 2-3 times and get bored and then
play some one-on-ones with someone and feel happy that I have clocked
2 more hours of practice that gets me to amazing levels someday. You
know, 'Practice makes perfect' and the like. The author hosts a
similar example from his life when he went golfing and "practicing"
with golf balls. He says with conviction that this will do jack shit
to your performance.

The idea of deliberate practice (DP) is quite different from the above form
of practice. Jerry Rice according to the author a near perfect example
of someone who did massive amounts of DP and in the end became legend.

>Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
>examining. It is activity designed specifically to improve
>performance, often with a teacher's help; it can be repeated a lot;
>feedback on results is continuously available; it's highly demanding
>mentally, whether the activity is purely intellectual, such as chess
>or business-related activities, or heavily physical, such as
>sports; and it isn't much fun.

**It's designed specifically to improve performance.**

During DP, one must identify certain sharply defined elements that
need improvement and work on them intently. These practices should be
designed in such a way that they stretch your current abilities. The
great performers, see a couple of issues and isolate each one of them
and work on them until they have seen sufficient improvement before
moving on to the next aspect.

It is recommended by the author that they are done with the guidance
of a teacher. In case we think that we have outgrown the benefits of a
teachers help, the author suggests to atleast give it another thought.

While learning it is ideal to be in the zone where we are just beyond our
comfort zone which makes us stretch our abilities. And it probably is
quite motivating instead of being a daunting task to approach.

**It can be repeated a lot**

In golf the ball rarely gets buried into the sand. Such shots are
quite rare. But when they happen you cannot expect to perform well as
you have rarely performed that shot. Top performers repeat a
lot. Isolation of the specific space where you need to improve is key,
followed by a lot of repetitions.

>Ted Williams, baseball's greatest hitter, would practice hit-
>ting until his hands bled. Pete Maravich, whose college basketball
>records still stand after more than thirty years, would go to the gym
>when it opened in the morning and shoot baskets until it closed at
>night.

**Feedback**

Following all this, one can work on his technique but it very
important to see progress and get feedback. Otherwise one will stop
getting any better and stop caring about the end goal. Feedback is
extremely crucial to feel motivated. Sometimes results might need
interpretation, trusting your own judgment might not really be the
best way to go about it. Is the blog post clear to a new reader? Will
people get the main idea? Is it organized well? Paul Graham for
example, appears to take this very seriously. Before he publishes a
post, he runs atleast a few loops of getting feedback from his friends
followed by correction before publishing it.

<!-- I remember exactly a year back when an STM said to me that he
doesn't --> <!-- need anyone to push him anymore and that he is
counting his hours of --> <!-- practice and finally that he was aiming
for 5 hours -->

**It is painful**

I can imagine working on things like my sentence construction. I know
I don't make the best sentences. First I would need to identify good
sentences and maybe try to emulate them in other works
consciously. This could be qualified as DP. But the shear repulsion to
that activity is huge, and pushing through all of it for maybe atleast
10k sentences, makes it painful I think. The violinists from the
Ericsson experiment stated practice as the least fun activity in their
daily life.

Everyone would achieve greatness if it were easy and fun. But everyone
doesn't and it is not easy and fun. Your willingness to do it will
distinguish you all the more. Think about Jerry Rice again! 

These tasks whether physical or not, seem to drain out much of our
mental energy as they are all about improving an unsatisfactory
performance and trying your hardest to improve these. *It is estimated
that 4-5 hours of DP seems to be the upper limit, across disciplines,
with sessions frequently lasting no more than 90 minutes.* The study of
violinists (TIO chap 4) for example shows that the kids that do DP
slept more not only during the night but also during the afternoons.

**A dramatic example**

"Laszlo Polgar, a Hungarian educational psychologist, formed the view
in the 1960s that **great performers are made, not born**." Laszlo
married with the intention of using his own kids as the experiment and
raised 3 women to become top level chess players. All kids were home
schooled and made to do DP. There was sufficient material for study on
chess by that time and that is one of the reasons why chess was chosen.  

All three were great players, but only one is the current world number
1 woman player. It is known within the family that Judith is the one
that worked the hardest and it seems to show. The other two started
having other interests or drifted off from the game.

In summary DP is when you work on specific things to stretch yourself
beyond your current capabilities. It will be hard, it will be
painful. Your willingness to do it will distinguish you all the
more. Think about Jerry Rice again!

### How DP works

**DPer's perceive more**

DPer's know where to look and where to get more information. If you
consider typewriters, in order to improve speed they look further into
the text and move their fingers in such a way that writing the next
words, is convenient. Expert doctors who look at X-rays, see far more
from it than amateurs. They understand the significance of the
indicators that average performers don't even notice. Top Tennis
players look at the hips and shoulders of servers to know where the
ball is going to go. It would be quite a feat to rely only on reaction
speed over the quarter of a second that the ball takes to cross the field.

**Knowing more**

>You didn't really have to know much about a field if you knew the
>best ways to analyze a problem and think it through, and you needed
>to know even less if your analysis and reasoning power could be
>juiced by a computer

And yet the time of computers beating humans hadn't arrived. Be it in
chess or GO. What was missing was the vast knowledge of the particular
positions in different cases and what sort of choices had what sort of
consequences. In chess apparently, master-level players posses chess
knowledge by a factor of 10-100 compared to good club-level
players. 

**Remembering more**

Earlier we saw that people in general are capable of holding 5-9
chunks in their head. This is the short-term memory that is being
talked about. In the study of remembering the maximum number of pieces
and their positions, the chess-masters were able to recollect every
single piece when it was real chess positions. But, when it came to
random arrangements they were as good as the control group.

This can be imagined like letters and words. Given a word it is easier
to remember if it is familiar and with little effort we can spell it
backwards even, but if the letters are in a random order, it is going
to be pretty hard. What chess players could be seeing is words.

And with a rich vocabulary of such words, they seem to be doing much
more. Apparently researchers have estimated that good club players
have a vocabulary of 100-1000 "words", but a master-level player has a
vocabulary of 1k-10k "words".

Holding 49 chess games in memory seems to be doing much more than what
the short-term memory can handle.

A study involving a description of a football game and 2 sets of
people demonstrates this. The description was shown to fans of the
game and random people. After some time recalling the details of the
game, was the task. The fans were able to recall the important parts
of the game about who passed to who and what the sequence of events
were, whereas the control group remembered trivial things like when
the crowd roared etc... and missed the crucial details.

>The fans' high-level knowledge of the game provided a frame- work on
>which to hang the information they had read.

Long-term-memory seems to be one that allows you to retrieve more
information in a fast and reliable way by providing hooks for you to
add your information to, more like connections.

>In the letters-versus-words analogy, it isn't just that novices see
>letters while experts see words; the experts also know the meanings
>of the words. 

Not everyone can hold 49 chess games in memory simultaneously. 

>It's clear that the superior memory of great performers doesn't just
>happen. Since it is built on deep understanding of the field, it can
>be achieved only through years of intensive study. It further
>requires consistently relating new information to higher-level
>concepts, which is hard work.

**Changes to physical structure**

The influence of DP on DPer's is even more impressive that the body
actually gets modified in the process. Changes to the body, the brain,
muscles, and even the heart can happen, to aid you in your field.

>Endurance runners, for instance, have larger hearts than average
>until they stop training.

>Athletes can change not just the size of their muscles but even the
>composition of them (the proportion of fast-twitch fibers to
>slow-twitch) through years of practice

>The brain's ability to change is greatest in youth, but it doesn't
>end there

The bottom line being that *there is path that exists*, that runs between
your current abilities to that of the greats. It is hard, extremely
long and demanding. Not many will follow it all the way till the
end. But if you do...

>But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself
>to an ideal, and if they can't stop you, then you become something
>else entirely... Which is ... Legend Mr Wayne!
>
> -Batman Begins


### Applying to our lives

**Know what you want to be**

To begin with you need to know where you want to go. Do you want to be
the greatest basketball player you can be? Do you want to be able to
reason and solve problems like an STM? Do you want to be the best at
your work? Do you want huge-ass muscles? Do you want to be amazing in
Data Science? Do you want very good at analyzing problems and
performing research (as would be needed by GiveWell)? Do you
want to be able to communicate ideas better?

>The skills and abilities one can choose to develop are infinite, but
>the opportunities to practice them fall into two general categories:
>opportunities to practice directly, apart from the actual use of the
>skill or ability, the way a musician practices a piece before
>performing it; and opportunities to practice as part of the work
>itself.

So for example, if you look at chess, you can study positions and make
a move and compare it to what and why the grand masters did it. This
is Practicing directly. Another way of DP could be to actually just
play games online and get practice as a result of that. 

It doesn't seem to matter how one practices as long as it meets the DP
criteria of high volume repetition and work that stretches your
skills.

**The music model**

When you want to get better at playing the piano, you can think of all
the ways it could be done much better. You could improve on say the
trill, or the speed or your knowledge of arpeggios or coordination of
both the hands etc... You look at each aspect. It is probably easy to
isolate and practice them. You can get feedback about your progress
looking at the tempo of improvement or from your coach or even watch a
video of yourself.

Thus, in the music model, you see what aspects need improvement,
isolate them and practice them. The practice and the real performance
have almost the same aspects to it.

The same thing can be applied to career-interviews even. In essence it
is similar as the key messages are going to be conveyed regardless of
the questions. Here you could look at aspects such as your humor,
your passion, logical flow of thoughts (for example using STAR
method), and the actual messages being delivered well. Feedback from a
mock interview with a friend or recording your self conveying the
important points could help.

For written work, it is probably best to emulate the method of one of
the best writers (as viewed by many) Benjamin Franklin. Here key
aspects to work on could be, grammar, elegance of expression,
perspicuity, organization, vocabulary etc... Benjamin Franklin (BF)
worked on his writing as a result of the feedback from his dad. For
some reason that motivated him to take on DP despite having little
time in addition to the work he was doing.

BF took the best work he could find and wrote down the meaning of each
sentence. A few days later, he would use these notes to form
sentences. And then he compared the original and his work, discovered
some faults and corrected them. His method was thus, look at what
needs to be improved (identify key aspect), try to forcibly write (DP)
and compare with the original (feedback). This he seems to have done
multiple times working on every single isolated aspect of his
writing. BF used the Spectator.

> instead of emulating the Spectator, you would choose a superior
> letter to the shareholders, advertisement, blog entry, or other
> appropriate model.

**The chess model**

In chess isolation of an aspect seems a little out of hand, as key
aspects are probably hard to find. But, with chess, thousands of books
on different positions, different games have been published. The DP
routine would be to look at a particular position and choose a move
and compare it to the move chosen by the master. Followed by analysis.

Business is like chess. You are presented with a position of a problem
and need to figure out the best move. Real world as it is makes it
hard to evaluate which of the proposed solutions is better. In any
case the process of focusing on the problem and evaluating solutions
is in itself instructive. This is called the case method and
apparently Harvard Business graduates would have done >500 cases by
the time they graduate.

>You might work in marketing for years and get only a couple of
>chances to market U.S. products in China, for example, so that's a
>skill you probably wouldn't be very good at. But in a short time you
>could study a dozen cases about marketing U.S. products in Our Lives
>in China. That's one step removed from actually marketing the
>products, but it puts you many steps ahead of anyone who has not
>studied that specific skill intensely and repeatedly


**The sports model**

The practice of athletes falls into two aspects in the sports
model. One is conditioning, things that allow you to perform certain
activities better. If you played NFL, you need speed, and muscles (for
explosiveness). Tennis players work on stamina so that they can still
play at the 3rd hour of the game. The other aspect is working on
critical skills like batting the baseball, or serving the tennis ball
in certain locations or hitting the golf ball out of the sand. The
difference between other models and this is that no 2 situations will
be exactly the same. The variability plays a huge role. Every time you
pass, the ball in NFL, the positioning of each player will be
different. But for a pianist the Beethoven stays the same no matter
what.

For conditioning in information and service based work, its probably
about getting stronger with the underlying cognitive skills; basic
math and accounting for financing, basic science for people in
engineering etc...

>For people who write and edit, the same applies to Fowler's Modern
>English Usage and Strunk and White's The Elements of Style.

There are classic guides available for every field and revisiting them
is one way of improving conditioning. Conditioning can also be done on
new material. Pencil editing a new article, analyzing the basic ratios
of an unfamiliar financial statement etc...

If we would like to become an expert in our field we would read
tons about our field, the history, read everything that the experts
are doing, get insights from colleagues etc... The goal is to gain
a lot of knowledge about the domain, but not just to amass
information. The point is that we would like to build a mental model
of how the domain functions. That is the crucial picture.

The second aspect of practice is based on focused
simulation. Sometimes it is difficult to engage in a lot of this
practice due to unpredictable opponents, fast responses and dynamic
situations. But it should still be possible to bat the baseball and
swing the golf club or shoot the ball into the basketball ring in ways
that would happen in the game, while focusing on high repetition and
immediate feedback.

### Deliberate Practice for innovation

It appears that even being creative is not not-possible with DP. Two
myths associated with creativity are a) that it happens suddenly (to
anyone) and b) too much knowledge inhibits creativity. 

**Sudden Creativity**

Although all fields require creativity, some fields in which people
are expected to be really creative are poets, composers and
painters. When Studying 76 composers or 131 painters or even 66 poets,
for their first glorious moment, the answer comes out to be
similar. Within the first five years no one had their first glorious
moment. With composers it took even more; 10 years for most of them. It
seems that you cannot escape the initial years before achieving
greatness akin to the '10 years of silence' or the '10-year rule'.

>Professor Howard Gardner of Harvard wrote a book-length study
>(Creating Minds) of seven of the greatest innovators of the early
>twentieth century: Albert Einstein, T. S. Eliot, Sigmund Freud,
>Mahatma Gandhi, Martha Graham, Pablo Picasso, and Igor Stravinsky.

The ten-year-rule seems to be prevalent irrespective of the field.

**Too much knowledge?**

Watt was responsible for the industrial revolution with his giant
innovation. The Newcomen engine wasn't very efficient, but it was
already there, before Watt improved it. The impact of Watt is not at
question here but the point is that there was no sudden spark. Watt's
training as a maker of scientific instruments gave him the skills and
knowledge with which to do it. A similar story occurs with the
innovation of the cotton gin as well. 

>From the telegraph to the airplane to the Internet, they're all
>adaptations and extensions of what existed, made possible by great
>insights but entirely impossible without a deep knowledge of, and
>reliance on, past achievements.

Domain specific knowledge seems key in becoming one of the greats,
whichever way you see it.

### Great performance in Youth and Age

**Knowledge is the foundation of great performance**

The average age that people get Nobel Prizes has increased by six
years over a 100 year period. This Nobel Prize effect is happening
across all domains such as economics, finance, Marketing,
organizational behavior, operations research. All these fields have
developed so much in the last couple of decades that it takes more
time to gain the foundation onto which great contributions can happen.

>Knowledge is the foundation of great performance, and in fields where
>important advances are being made continually, mastering the
>accumulated knowledge takes longer all the time.

No one has become exceptional on his own, a striking feature in the
lives of the great souls are the support they receive at the critical
times in their development.

**Supporting environment**

>The greatest value of a supporting home environment is that it
>enables a person to start developing early.

Starting early certainly has its advantages. The body can adopt itself
in critical ways in the early stages. You have more time in your
hands, less responsibilities allowing you to work on DP. It is quite
possible to acquire 10k hours before reaching 20 years. This might not
be possible for everyone though owing to their circumstances.

>Simonton's research found that "exceptional creators are less likely
>to develop during times of anarchy

Apparently the role of environment is much higher than we
think. Research conducted informs that adolescents are able to sustain
concentrated effortful study (very important for DP), in certain
environments characterized as both stimulating and supporting
environments.

>A stimulating environment was one with lots of opportunities to
>learn and high academic expectations. A supportive environment was
>one with well-defined rules and jobs, without much arguing over who
>had to do what, and in which family members could rely on one
>another.

But what this means to adults like me who want to take control of
their life now is unclear.

**Defying age**

Research has established quite well that as we age we slow
down. Things such as remembering, solving unfamiliar problems take
twice as much time as young people. Even coordinating the arms and
legs becomes difficult. 

But, Yo-Yo Ma was a world-famous cellist at age twenty who became even
better at 40. Huh? Studies in broad range of fields show consistently
that excellent performers (be it in piloting, music, bridge,
management), seem to suffer from the same age-related issues as
everyone else, __*except in their domain.*__

This is probably one of the most important outcomes in research. This
fills me with immense joy to know that I don't have to be lame when I
am old and that I can still be thriving atleast in things where I
perform excellently. I immediately recollect the image of Scooby, who
is 60 years of age and still has the physique of a killer body builder
and endurance of a marathoner. Expert much!

Psychologists measured the response speeds of some old pianists by
checking how fast they could tap their fingers to a choice in the
screen. This was slow as expected. But when the same pianists were
given piano related tasks like finger taping or finger coordination,
they didn't seem to have slowed down at all. Corollary: More DP will
result in you not sucking with old age.

Arthur Rubinstein continued to perform publicly to great acclaim,
until he was eighty nine. Julio Franco (baseball) played in the 2007
season at age 49, owing to his regimen of intense exercise and diet. A
seventy-four-year-old man in 2004 ran 4 minutes faster than the gold
medal performance of 1896 Olympics. WHAT!!!

Eventually of course the age catches on. Warren Buffett has decided to
retire. Arthur Rubinstein gave up performing publicly at eighty-nine
because he was becoming deaf and blind. 

But what pushes them so far, with the continual practice, painful
pushing beyond what's comfortable, for many hours a day and years on
end? Why do chess grand masters continue to work for 4-5 hours a day
studying chess position when it does not necessarily bring wealth?

Why?

### Where does passion come from?

**Intrinsic motivation**

In essence Shizuka Arakawa, a figure skater, during her practice had
fallen on her ass 20000 times atleast before she finally won the gold
medal for Olympics in 2006. But why?

There are two kinds of motivation. One is the intrinsic kind and the
other is the extrinsic kind. Motivated by factors from within such as
the need to achieve, the need to power over others, even the need to
do good in the world, are intrinsic motivators. Extrinsic motivators
motivate us extrinsically such as doing things for purely money. What
Shizuka Arakawa had seems to be intrinsic.  

Intrinsic motivation and high creative achievement go hand in hand
according to research. A wide range of creative achievers seem to be
devoted to great questions or problems in their field and feel driven
to *pursue them for decades.*

But how can something that is not fun at all (as we have seen until
now) be intrinsically motivating?

>Mihaly Csikszentmihali suggests a mechanism that connects the
>intrinsic motivation and demands of DP. His work on "flow" suggests a
>state where time slows down, enjoyment is heightened and the
>painfulness of the task becomes not observable. 

In simple terms, when the tasks are easy then it gets boring. When
tasks involved are challenging enough that they just stretch us beyond
our skills, then we are in flow. If it gets too challenging then we
get frustrated. Top-level performers in sports seem to rate practice
high on the scale of enjoyableness. But the violinists seen in
Ericsson's study seem to rank it as not enjoyable. The sharp contrast
continues.

The author seems to suggest as an explanation the following:

>But at a deeper level one has to suspect that practice is somehow
>meeting an inner need for anyone who can maintain it at an intense
>level for years.

I think what the author is suggesting is that even though Ericcson's
violinists rate practicing as least fun, practicing somehow satisfies
an inner need for people who maintained it at an intense level for
years. And by the looks of it could it be that the violinists were
stretching their abilities way more than "just outside their comfort
zone"? Maybe it is a part of DP?

I will leave this with one final comment. Amir khan can be seen
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aVw1gZ9Ncg) training to look his muscular best in a short time. He
trains to exhausting amounts because of his trainer, both in cardio and
weights. He sees the results and it's quite frankly nothing short of
amazing. Sometimes during the workouts he is seen to be saying *"I
fucking give up"*, but the trainer fakes him into doing more
weights anyway. In the end the results are insane. So Amir, how did you like
doing your workout? *\*Insert Ericcson's violinists response here\**.

The question of whether we need to do it at this level, at the level
of Jerry Rice or the Ericcson's violinists seems to be a discussion
for another post. But to be Jerry Rice, you need to be the best of the
best of the best. You need to train like the best of the best of the
best. Maybe it will be painful in the end. But we shall be able to run
on purely intrinsic motivation, just like the Ericcson's violinists?

Moving on.

**Extrinsic motivation**

Extrinsic motivation however is expected to not get people to the
greatest heights. But, 

>When Watson and Crick were struggling to find the structure of DNA,
>they worked almost nonstop because they knew they were in a race with
>other research teams. Alexander Graham Bell worked similarly on the
>telephone, knowing he was in competition with Elisha Gray, whom he
>beat to the patent office by just hours.

Not all extrinsic motivators are bad. Extrinsic motivators that
re-enforces intrinsic motivation could still work effectively.

These extrinsic motivators that re-enforce the intrinsic motivation
benefit kids especially in the early stages. Parents instead of
saying,"if you don't practice we'll cancel your allowance," seemed to
say "if you don't practice we'll take the piano away". Of course this
worked only the child cared about the piano. With time the students
become responsible for their own motivation.

**Child prodigies**

Sometimes apparently there are cases where kids show amazing drive
*(intrinsic motivation)* to do something, like a 10 month old baby
crying for paper and pen to draw all the time. Although, the people
who do become top-level achievers are rarely those 'child
prodigies'. This is certainly true in business, if you look at the
early lives of Welches, Ogilvies, and Rockefellas, there was no hint
at the giant success that was about to come.

Some spark seems to have started, just like in the kid who started
taking piano seriously, once he saw at close range an actual pianist
performing.


### Final words

Becoming the greatest of greats involves a large investment of time and
resources. The price people often pay to rise to the top of any
field are quite high.

*There is path that exists*, that runs between your current abilities
to that of the greats. It is hard, extremely long and demanding. Not
many will follow it all the way till the end. But if you do...

## Application
### Synopsis of 'Talent is Overrated'

We need to do a lot of DP to improve aspects of each of the above
skills. It needs to be remembered that domain knowledge is quite
important. The goal is to focus on key aspects that need training and
perform DP over them. Some of the salient ideas of DP are to:

- focus on key aspects and train in a focused and repeated
  manner. (chess model)

- when key aspects are not isolatable, then we try to work on
  scenarios, where we compare our performance to the case performance
  (chess model)
  
- Sometimes we might need to work on both conditioning and focused
  practice at high volume (sports model)

- Domain knowledge is key. We always need to understand that
  techniques to solve problems might be good, but domain knowledge
  just like in chess is required to create the long-term-memory hooks,
  which seem to be required in every career especially to be the
  greatest of greats.
  
- Top DPer's seem to be able to perform 5 hours of DP/day at max,
  followed by a lot of rest.
  
- After 30 we will start seeing that our skills that are not kept up with
  DP, are fading away.
  
### Knowing what you want to be

- I recently in [this post](/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html) realized that working at an Effective
Altruism Organization (EAO) is probably as highly impact as I can
get. I have also seen other careers but I decided to start work on
Data Science (DS) for the next few years (to gain some [flexible
career capital](/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html)) with a focus on getting into EAOs in the
future. DS allows me to gain skills relevant to many EAOs. EAOs
typically require critical thinking, good communication and ability to
do research, i.e., identify what is important to solve a problem,
know what data you need, know how to use statistics to your advantage,
propose the best solution to the problem based on the resources
available, and finally communicate the results to a general
audience. So that means skills to be learn't are,

	1. Solving problems with critical thinking: hypothesis forming,
	collecting relevant data, analysis using statistical methods

	2. Statistics

	3. Communication: Writing and presentation

- In addition, I want to be in exceptional health when I am 60 like
[Scooby](http://scoobysworkshop.com/2015/09/26/scoobys-30-years-of-muscular-growth/).

	4. Weight training

	5. Cardio 
	
	6. diet

- Furthermore, I want to be exceptionally good at one sport so that I
can play it at a high level and enjoy even when I am old.

	1. Basketball or Badminton (just one)

### Critical Thinking

>issue in order to form a judgement.

You are what you think and you need your thinking to be free of
mistakes. You need to consciously train it. This seems to be similar
to the music model, similar to what Benjamin Franklin did to improve
his writing. In order to do DP, I seek high volume repetition of the
principles of critical thinking as given in [criticalthinking.org](www.criticalthinking.org).

I will start at ["Becoming an art of your thinking"](http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/becoming-a-critic-of-your-thinking/478). Examine the
strategies and go for high volume repetition. And for feedback, it
looks like I might not get any during my high volume repetition by
myself. Just like in real world business, it looks I am going to have
to count on the process of the exercise to be in itself
instructive. Writing down might help for a future me to evaluate it
once I have forgotten (just like Benjamin Franklin did it). I could
always request an STM to review my work if he has time.

The type of scenarios to practice in seem aplenty, I could practice
them on scenarios in my life, scenarios at work, scenarios from the
news and scenarios from my learning online.

In addition to the above I should also look into [Rationalists
Taboo](http://pradeep90.github.io/Rationalists-Taboo.html) and [thinking narrowly](http://pradeep90.github.io/Think-Narrowly.html) to help me get better at
thinking, indeed with high repetition.

It seems to meet all the values of DP, including the pain of DPing. ;)

### Statistics

For statistics, I first have got to take a course to get to town with
the basics. After that is seems to be about knowing when to apply and
what. I am only interested in statistics that helps me solve
problems. Learning statistics seems to follow the chess method. DS in
general is about problem solving with statistics. Focusing on solving
high volume of problems and comparing to what the solution actually is
and what techniques they have used might be one of the ways to
go. This could be a rare case where in I am probably going to be
practicing during the work.

I guess I also need to ask around to understand better my needs and
sources on these subjects to make high repetition of problem solving
possible.

### Communication writing/presentation

For me writing would follow the sports model. Sports model because of
the need to work on conditioning and the need to isolate aspects.

**Conditioning**


- Improve speed of writing

	A website by the name of [typeracer](typeracer.com) allows you to race other
    people based on typing speeds. With a certain premium membership
    you get statistics as well. If this skill is quite important then
    I need to practice more of it. An STM initially suggested 5-15
    mins a day. I could see where I am today and where I am in 1 week
    and plan for some changes based on the results. I mostly race with
    myself, trying to get better as the opponents are usually random
    and not matching your skill level.
	
- Write with less spelling mistakes

	The same [typeracer](typracer.com) has this mode called DEATH MODE. When in
    DEATH mode you are not allowed to make any mistakes at all. I
    could use this, or pay more attention in the normal mode to make
    less typing mistakes. I shall try this for a week for 15 mins a
    day and take it from there.

**High repetition focused practice**

Lets first look at writing. Just like Benjamin Franklin emulated the
Spectator, I guess I need to emulate something. But what are the
aspects I want to focus on? Maybe an STM can tell me just like Benji's
dad told him? It's quite vague or maybe I need to think more about it
i.e., compare it to the works I respect. I really loved the way
80k-hours wrote their articles that had so much of research and an
amazing delivery. Writing such a big article at such a level is
something I would like to aim for. I also love how an STM structures
his passages. There is humor, at the right places, and the logical
structure of the arguments is pretty darn awesome. There are still to
this date that I go back to some of [his essays](http://pradeep90.github.io/Revenge-or-Grow.html). If I am looking
at logical structure I hope my exercises in Critical thinking should
do me some help. But, first I wait for some feedback.

Following the Franklins method is a bit vague now, as in I don't see
what aspect I would like to improve. 

### Others

I am not really sure what skill is required for weight training other
than knowing what to eat and maxing out at the gym. There is probably
some need to think critically to analyze issues and find workarounds or
solutions for them, but that seems about it.

In order to improve my basketball, I allocate 6 hrs per week in the
weekends. 3 hrs of DP on Saturday and 1 hr on Sunday. 

**Conditioning**

More stamina, more speed (quick bursts) is required to beat my current
opponents. Instead of doing strenuous biking 4 days a week, maybe I
can focus on High intensity Training (HIT), during the same time,
focusing on sudden bursts and stamina as a result of that. For
feedback I do have a heart rate monitor and a watch which I can use
to measure my progress regularly. 

**Isolating aspects**
 
Aspects such as in-game shooting, ball-handling in certain situations,
going to the basket for a layup in different cases needs to be
practiced. High volume repetition followed by testing in the weekend
games or one-on-one should give the feedback I think. For things like
shooting I can manage feedback looking at the percentage of shots
converted while shooting from a distance, and track it over time.
