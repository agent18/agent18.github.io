## Earning potential

Friends after masters earn from 85k to 130k cash as beginners I think
based on location. 

I suspect the money aspect is pretty standard within Holland, ~40k for
beginner and 45k for bigger companies, for master graduates. Anyways, I am not interested in
getting money right now, just need to survive. If the experience is
crazy, if there are crazy learning's, and if it is possible to achieve a
lot within the company, that would still work for me, it appears.

If I choose this career, I better be able to change the lives of
1000's of people with this science, or I better be able to give
at least 50k$ within the next 5 years, that is with the understanding I
would make at least 150k $ cash!

## Ways in which I can migrate to the US

1. Do a 1.5 year masters in US

	The cons being:
	- money for tuition and living (can't expect scholarship having
      done nothing to become better) is  a problem
	- It will take at least 2019 august before I start
	- If I don't find a job, I don't know what happens
	
2. Do DS for a few years and become very good and apply at the US
   directly
   
   The cons being:
	- Not sure of the shot to the US
	
3. Join Google or other big companies within Europe and then move to
   the US with an L1
   
   The cons being: 
   - Not sure of how much to rely on this
	   
### how to start

1. 1.5 year master anywhere (US preferably)

2. 3 months prep at home/ join a course

3. join a traineeship in Netherlands / join as a starter

	I could work in ASML, in DS, there are a couple of traineeships being
	offered around the country. Airlines seem to be interested in data
	centric roles for generic engineers. A dutch friend of mine from the
	same master as me got an offer from KLM for a DS job involving some
	engineering.

~~5. somehow use your experience until now and combine that with DS~~

6. If I do a serious course in US/London, maybe I can apply directly
   to the US.
   
   Investigate this about internationals in 2 bootcamps in US and London
   
### Mid-way

1. Look at place like Center for Disease Control, Google, Khan Academy, Bayes Impact and DataKind

2. Become a product leader and grow up the ladder and just earn-to-give


## Main points for choosing this career?

- I personally know a couple of people who went to this field straight
  from a master within my university. 
- I see a nice personal fit with programming (python) and problem-solving
- Suggested by 80k hours
- Friends in this Apple field earn >130k as a starting option

## What does  matter?

When, I get my Citizenship within Holland, matters. I think it is much
a safe buffer I would like to have before. I am not sure what I can do
when I go back to India, my earning potential, my impact potential
etc..., leave quality of life and all that shit.

Also, I just have a few more years to clock here before I get
citizenship, I might as well get it and then leave or attempt other
things.

## Some problems

Language could be a barrier within Netherlands/

## Important questions to be answered

  * [ ] ^^

1. Find some people who are doing something like you? 

People who managed to go out of the country and find jumped to DS

2. Knowing earning potential of DS within Europe/Netherlands

In case I get stuck in Netherlands what do I do?

3. What have DS done in direct work

4. look at some good examples of some old DS

5. What is their career path? What do they do after being a DS

6. Interesting options within DS (finance)

7. Some linkedin profiles?

8. Is L1 really an option in the long term or should I try my hand at
   a master?

## TODO

  * [ ] Speak to Tim 
  Ask him about how to get into career, how much language is a barrier
  and what sort of work he does by next week
  
  * [ ] Try to have a chat with Vaidehi and ask her about DS in
        Holland
		
			
  * [ ] Can I expect a scholarship if I do a masters in the US
		
  * [ ] Getting a job in respective countries once I  apply for their bootcamps


  * [ ] Check this course out "Machine learning in Trading"combination
        of finance and DS
