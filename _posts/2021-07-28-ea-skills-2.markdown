## Entry Question

What are the next concrete steps I could take to become a researcher
in one of the EA organizations.

## Current level

HRI --> HR Interview

## Disclaimer

I am "heavily" paraphrasing what people have told me about what
skills are important. Any misunderstanding from my part is my mistake
alone.

## How to get to the potential options?

1. Well it appears you can look at what successful people did (who
   were "similar to you" once upon a time).
   
   "Similar to you" meaning, people without a Harvard degree, people
   without an economics PhD, people who at some point of time didn't
   get into EA organizations and then later managed to get in.
   
2. I could offer my services as an intern, or an assistant to people
   who are already in the loop and that way perhaps I can find out
   more about what sort of work is being done or what "skills" I would
   actually need. 
   
3. Ask people in the business "what steps I need to take" to become
   "GiveWell/OPP/RP material"


## What did the successful people do

A while back I asked people in the EA community about how people who
got rejected in EA organizations, "made it" eventually. And the
following section is a summary of the answers from [that post in the
EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but).

It appears that the successful people wrote prior to getting into an
EA organization. Most of the people who wrote in this post atleast
have a few posts on the EA forum in their belt about EA topics. I on
the other hand wrote one post on Talent Constrainedness of EA and
cringe at that article wherein I butchered my concrete
thinking. (Thanks to an STM for pointing it out).

RP--> Rethink Priorities, CA--> Convergence Analysis, FHI--> Future Of
Humanities Institute, CE--> Charity Entrepreneurship.

Some people have made "thoughtful" and "intensely researched posts on
the EA forum" after being rejected by an EA organization and before
getting into a Researcher position in an EA organization. Saulius, for
example, after not making it to ACE as a full-timer (after his
internship there), published 2 "well researched" articles, where one
of them even made it to [ACE's Blog](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/is-the-percentage-of-vegetarians-and-vegans-in-the-u-s-increasing/) and the other [on EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gGiiktK69R2YY7FfG/fish-used-as-live-bait-by-recreational-fishermen)
(with 50+ karma points). Apparently this sparked the interest amongst
Rethink Priorities recruiter. **Note:** One has to also do well in the
tasks and interviews to get into the organization.

Another example is Micheal St. Jules, after not making it in 2016 to
ACE or GiveWell, before getting his internship at Charity
Entrepreneurship in 2020 had won an "EA forum prize" for his post on
[Biases](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gYPT6pGwPWL5YywTK/biases-in-our-estimates-of-scale-neglectedness-and) (which grossed an awesome 90+ karma points, contrast that
to the 30 points I got for my Talent-Constrained post ðŸ¤¦).

Some other people seemed to have applied like crazy and eventually
made it. Micheal Arid applied to ~30 organization positions before
getting it eventually into 2 organizations. He suspects that doing all
these interviews would have helped him understand what the interviews
required. He shares some of the things he thinks might have helped him
[here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2eEn8BHW69StPgtCi/how-have-you-become-more-or-less-engaged-with-ea-in-the-last?commentId=v5jwtvF29XoQyHzTw) where the main point seems to be that he read and consumed
"practically everything EA" (Less wrong articles, books recommended by
top EA people, all EA conference videos, etc.). He now has a
staggering 7k karma points in just 3 years. The most awesome thing
about Arid is that in 3 years since he went from 28 rejections to
Future Of Humanities Institute goddammit.


Peter Wildeford worked for over 5 years doing EA research by himself
after which he was able to co-found an EA org. One thing Peter seems
to have done is write a lot of Forum posts (while "aiming to emulate
good [reasoning transparency](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/reasoning-transparency)" and the style of highly up-voted
posts). He has a very high karma of 7000 points. (Contrast that to me
with 154 points). He has written around 38 posts in the EA forum
before becoming Co-founder at Rethink Priorities. 

Saulius seems to have started of with an internship in ACE after which
it didn't convert to a job. A year later he works for Rethink
Priorities. He was rejected by other organizations too. Meanwhile with
his experience and connections from ACE, he wrote two "intensely
researched" articles (one [published on ACE website](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/is-the-percentage-of-vegetarians-and-vegans-in-the-u-s-increasing/) and the [other
on EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gGiiktK69R2YY7FfG/fish-used-as-live-bait-by-recreational-fishermen)), which seemed to have grabbed the attention of
recruiters at least. He also has a high karma in the EA forum of about
3000 points. Prior to getting into Rethink Priorities he had written 3
posts. **Note:** One has to also do well in the tasks and interviews
to get into the organization.

Gregory Lewis applied for a research role in GWWC and got rejected
back in 2015. Since mid-2017 he works for FHI. In the meantime he
continued to work as a Public Health Doctor and also appears to have
been writing on the forum. He suspects his current role at FHI was
"mainly because" of his public health background than his "forum
ouevre". He also has a high karma 3000 points unsurprisingly.

Micheal St. Jules applied to GIVEWELL and ACE in 2016 and didn't get
the roles (when he was new to EA). In the recent past he started
working with his local EA group, started commenting and writing in the
EA forum which was still not enough. He got an internship in Charity
Entrepreneurship, following an EA forum prize, attending EA global and
meeting people from Charity Entrepreneurship. He has over 1000 points
and currently is a visiting fellow (internship) at Rethink Priorities.

Micheal Arid got ~28 rejections in 2019 before getting 2 job
offers. After a year of experience he was able to apply for 11
positions and got 4. In the mean time he seems to have written many
posts on EA forum. He shares some of the things he thinks might have
helped him [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2eEn8BHW69StPgtCi/how-have-you-become-more-or-less-engaged-with-ea-in-the-last?commentId=v5jwtvF29XoQyHzTw) where the main point seems to be that he read or
consumed "practically everything" (Less wrong articles, books
recommended top EA people, all EA conference videos, etc..). He now
has a staggering 7k karma points in just 3 years. The most awesome
thing about Arid is that in 3 years he made it to FHI. :)

In summary,   
- write "well" (high karma posts) in the EA forum and "a lot".
- "Consume EA content"
- Attend EA global


## Offering services as an intern or assistant

Assistant to a researcher or internship with the idea being that you
can see what they do and perhaps learn what skills they value and work
on it later.

Saulius seems to suggest that after his first internship (@ACE) "he
knew what sort of articles would be useful" and also gained relevant
connections with whom he collaborated on two articles.

I was unable (in so far as I applied) to get an internship or an
assistantship, so don't have my own experience to add. But it
definitely something I should consider in addition to the work I am
going to do.


For example, Saulius seems to suggest that after his
internship with ACE, he "knew better what kind of articles would be
useful and had some relevant connections". He wrote a couple of
articles, which he suspects were the main reason he got invited to
an RP interview.
   
## Asking people what steps/skills to take (clean up)

I asked people who are Researchers in EA orgs, "roughly" the
following: "What steps would I/someone take to become GIVEWELL/Rethink
Priorities/OPP material?" or "What skills do I need to become
GIVEWELL/Rethink Priorities/OPP material?"

**Peter**:

Peter Wildeford suggests that the best thing applicants can do to
improve their odds of being a successful researcher is to **read and
write independent research** for the EA forum with [good reasoning
transparency](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/reasoning-transparency#Example_of_GiveWell_charity_reviews) and get feedback from the community. In addition he
says it may also be good to **get relevant credentials** to perform
research at such organizations e.g., "top **forecaster** on Metaculus
or Good Judgement Open".

**David from RP**

David is pursuing an economics PhD and was part-timing at Rethink
Priorities. His suggestions were:

- Be able to "read" social science papers (academic papers in Lancet,
  Nature or Science) and "comment on and understand" their
  methodologies, data quality, internal external validity, weaknesses
  and understanding assumptions.
- Have a solid understanding of statistics and causal inference
- knowledge how to discount for trustworthiness of a paper

And perhaps consider the following steps to get there:

- Consider getting a relevant degree 
- Can do online courses for statistics and causal inference, textbooks
  and material where you have lots of questions and feedback.
- start a reading group where you can discuss with other peers about
  academic papers for example.  

**MSJ suggests the following:**

MSJ's 
- Try starting with an internship.
- Provide feedback on the research of orgs, publicly or by asking for
  opportunities to review unpublished work.
- Do a literature review or Cost-Effectiveness analysis on some
  EA-related topic (like that of [Saulius](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/saulius)'s posts) and post on EA
  forum
- Sign up to orgs that allow you to be a reviewer of their research
  (e.g., Charity Entrepreneurship seems to have some [opportunities
  now](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/volunteer.html)).

For "Data Analysis type" roles:
- For survey related roles use Mixed-Models and reproduce "EA Survey
  Analysis" and find other insights from the data. 
- There is another survey on wild animal suffering which needs
  analysis, and you can help me with the getting the data.

**Alicia Wang from GIVEWELL's feedback** 

The Researcher job at GiveWell involves trying to gauge evidence,
piecing together poor evidence, and working with open-ended
questions. She also thinks it is a "good idea" to practice with the
[different reports on GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/research) (look in ["Prioritized List of
Programs"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TG7WRU85p1SEjir-5qvIEg4kVG9a4Lnzdgwcub8aKSs/edit#gid=0) and "[other charity reviews](https://www.givewell.org/research/other-charity-reviews)") the following skills:

- Understanding academic research ([how we evaluate a study](https://blog.givewell.org/2012/08/23/how-we-evaluate-a-study/)), the
  strengths and weaknesses and guessing the effect size for the target
  population.
  
- Cost-Effectiveness analysis (e.g., "simpler" Cost-Effectiveness
  estimates such as [this](https://www.givewell.org/charities/DMI) and more are [available](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TG7WRU85p1SEjir-5qvIEg4kVG9a4Lnzdgwcub8aKSs/edit#gid=0)).
  
- Communicating in a transparent way probably what is promising and
  what you are uncertain about (again GiveWell reports show how it is
  done and there are at least [61 of them](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TG7WRU85p1SEjir-5qvIEg4kVG9a4Lnzdgwcub8aKSs/edit#gid=0)).
  
- She has done courses from MIT in person and said she benefited from doing
  courses [like this](https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/) (available in edX). 
  
- Also the ability to state the next steps, communicate clearly the
    uncertainty during work trials. This will be very important also
    in the tests.

and do it how?

**Stephan**

Skills:

- Ability to read Cochrane meta analysis, literature pubmed, scholar, econ papers
- Cost-Effectiveness (botec)
- Doing science with uncertainty
- Quickly evaluating interventions (how many people have the disease
  and how much would it cost per person)
- writing conversation notes
- Critical thinking and communication in writing.

And perhaps take the following steps,
- Practice writing [conversation notes](https://www.givewell.org/research/conversations) like these, although the
  recordings are not available, try to emulate the style
- There seems to be lot of material on GiveWell website which I can
  use to perhaps train on.

**Conclusion**

Yes some of the skills are vague, and how to get to "improve these
skills" is a hard question too. But there is a lot of research
material on GiveWell's website, which can be used to say deliberate
practice.

A summary of the suggested steps seem to be:
1. Read and write research (literature reviews, Cost-Effectiveness
   analysis etc.) with good reasoning transparency
2. Become a forecaster
2. Provide feedback on research of organizations (publicly or by signing up to
   be a reviewer etc.)
3. "Understand academic papers and make comments on various aspects
   such as effect size for target population, discounting for
   uncertainty etc."
4. "Practice making conversation notes"
5. "Practice making quick evaluations of an intervention"
6. "Do courses such as the ones provided by MIT for GH&P and for
   statistics and causal inference.
7. Develop the ability to state the next steps
8. Communicate clearly regarding uncertainty
9. Critical thinking and communication

I still think there is scope to discuss with greats like Arid or even
other folk from OPP or maybe looking on fb and asking to meet with
other researchers in groups. For example Arid is ready to have a
deeper call later once I have read this and have additional questions
to deal with.

The sample from which I collected is not random and the
representativesness to the true population must be lacking. But amidst
that uncertainty and the lack of a better way to get this knowledge, I
accept the above information.

## So what steps should you take

What all it envelopes, what material to use as guideline, and how to practice

**Courses to improve GH&P knowledge and Statistics**

This course is by esther dufalo . I am just hoping for some
introduction to GH&P and biases and how they do it... From there I
will start somewhere. 

For statistics I am not sure I want to already delve into it without
knowing how deep to go. I am hoping my reading on GiveWell (if it goes
that far) will help me with this.

**Understanding academic papers**

Plan is to suck on the teet of GiveWell.

**Reading research**

notes by Micheal A

comments by Micheal A

Maybe also ask people

Less wrong content, EA youtube videos, EA global

Perhaps I can write a review on someones work as a way of
understanding their content?

And then follow it up with a review like how saulius did.

There are also questions to answer here and perhaps I can reach out to
some people to ask some hot questions they would like investigated
perhaps?

**Writing Research**



**Review works of orgs**

**Communicating research clearly**




For lack of any other better way to do it, I am going to prioritize or
give weight age to steps that are not vague and have a more than 2
people endorsing it.




## What are the next steps

what can you DP? how? and what you cannot DP and why not?

**Ideas as a result**
1. volunteering Jamie Harish or MSJ
2. Apply to assistant roles
3. Doing independent research
   Make Cost-Effectiveness estimates, prioritize cause areas, find
   best funding opportunities.
4. criticize others work
5. indulge in Bayesian thinking
6. forecasting improving
7. Work on statistics
8. Do course on GH&P at JPAL.
9. Ask on the group resources to topic you are researching on

## How sure are you that you know what skills to train

3000 points. Prior to getting into Rethink Priorities he had written 3

has a staggering 7k karma points in just 3 years. The most awesome
thing about Arid is that in 3 years he made it to FHI. :)

In summary,   
- write "well" (high karma posts) in the EA forum and "a lot".
- "Consume EA content"
- Attend EA global
