## First impressions

- Easy to get in
I think I can move into it by say joining ASML as a fresher and see
how I can kill with that. Going to US will have to wait for now.

- Not sure about the skill development

- apparently easier to get in, no crazy competition.

- Worst case I could do an MBA and boom, move
to other more paying/learning jobs if this doesn't cut it for me.

My cousin was a mechanical engineer doing heat load calculations in
Dubai at the age of 29, he moved into sales and is probably earning
200k$ or more after 15 years of sales experience and tax free in Dubai. He has
made crazy money and his lifestyle has completely changed. Right now
he has a couple of houses in India and 2 cars and a lavishly spent 3
bedroom apartment. He has a car worth 43000 Euros. And I stick with my
estimate that he is making atleast 200k$ without paying any
taxes. This means atleast an earning-to-give potential of about 100k$?
making around 200k$ without any taxes in Dubai as a result. 

Sales in Dubai seems like definitely a fucking lucrative career, with the
possibility of growth etc... 

  * [ ] How much is he actually making? How much can I make in Dubai?

## difference between marketing and sales [Source](http://www.differencebetween.net/business/difference-between-sales-and-marketing/)

Aim with both is to make revenue for the company. They are closely
interlinked with each other. Small companies wont distinguish between
the two, but large companies would have clear distinctions for the
two. 


Marketing includes *identifying the needs of the customer* *producing
innovative products* and *promoting the product through
advertisements*. It is the task of the sales person to persuade
customer to buy the product. Marketing is about making leads or
prospects and sales is about converting them. 

Marketing is not direct, Sales is really about interpersonal
interaction. It involves one-on-one meetings, networking and calls.

Something to be vary about is after 15 years in a country if moving
will be useful. In other words am I tied down to my where my
connections are situated?

Marketing aims at longer term where as sales pertain to short term goals.


P.S

Need to do other things, didn't get to finish the article I was
reading and write information from that. Need to make more solid
goals, right now things are vague for me as to how much work I should
put in and so naturally I escape, seeming doing nothing before I
publish as that is the easy way out of working a lot more given the
time constraints.

But I think I can say with confidence that If I don't write I don't research.
