I am considering doing some courses from Poverty Action Lab such as Data Science for Social Scientists, Microeconomics, and the challenges to Global Poverty. Is it a good place to start?"

Sounds good to me!

### Anjan Gantapara

Example did coursera machine learning course after his phd in
computational stuff to get to a job in DS. Seems knowledgeable in
statistics after which Philips hired him.

"I employed advanced Statistical Mechanics concepts and modern Monte
Carlo techniques to simulate micro- and nano-meter size anisotropic
particles and elucidate their phase behavior as a function of various
macroscopic controllable parameters."

### Exercises

Data Camp
Kaggle
http://datasciencemasters.org/ 

https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview


### So far

I have an fb post coming with some examples of what people did...

https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-went-from-zero-coding-skills-to-data-scientist-in-6-months-c2207b65f2f3

It takes 6 months...

Based on the above, Statistics, experiment design, scientific method
expertise

SQL data analysis course etc... 

https://medium.com/fully-understood/how-to-learn-machine-learning-from-scratch-and-for-free-5753fa2170dd


https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-got-4-data-science-offers-and-doubled-my-income-2-months-after-being-laid-off-b3b6d2de6938


## Ideally 

I would like to copy the people who made the transition

**Course in ML**

- fast ai (detailed AF) [100 hrs]<-- critically acclaimed by peter and
  this other guy

- random course on coursera for [60hrs]

- Just start with Kaggle and see where it gets you (quick and dirty?)
  [unknown]
  
- https://cloud.google.com/training/data-ml

**Course in Statistics basics**

- Khan academy all questions and answers AP stats?

- Maybe: https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html

- Statistics I Princeton / Coursera

- Data science for social scientists

- microeconomics

But these are books :(

- https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/

- Statistical sleuth 

**Experience with projects**

- experience through kaggle competitions [unknown]

**Sql course**

https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/SQL/SelfPaced/course/ ?



**Tableau learning**


**Prepare projects list**

- shiny nlp (DS)
- kaggle ML (ML)

Work on


### Ideally 2

**starting at kaggle**

for ML... and do exams. as and when necessarey learn from fast.ai

**Peter suggested Pythiath course:**
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/?fbclid=IwAR0a-S06xLRHlFWkCndGe8sjrTMgbAJbteL9HNlcyzmX9azcod-Bzo53KLI

**Statistics course**
Finish Khan Academy Statistics and Probability. 

https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-learning NOT SURE ABUOT THIS!

Do some course...

**ML course**

fast.ai
kaggle
DATACAMP

**DS course**

https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-of-data-analysis-part-1-statistics-usi

coursera course [done already]

**SQL course**


I would like to do the MIT course, Statistics course, follow it up
with heavy KAGGLE for ML (more info on fast.ai) and statistics as
needed.. More problems on data camp


## Examples (tbd)

**Look for examples regarding?**
https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-lewis-42131224/?originalSubdomain=au

Above also did a machinelearning course but that was part of the
DSS. prior to jumping into DS FT job. Of course shes much better than
me as a base line with her statistical knowledge. This was her
original [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/@katemarielewis).

vadehi
amrithpal
etc...
## Target 3 months

I want to pick up a statistics course and a DS course and an ML
course. Mainly do examples and see how that goes.


## Explaining logic for ML being first action

I need "ML". Because ASML swears by it. Peter thinks it is
important. ING aslo [seems to want ML](https://www.glassdoor.nl/Vacature/amsterdam-senior-data-engineer-vacatures-SRCH_IL.0,9_IC3064478_KO10,30.htm?rdserp=true&jl=3645420576&guid=00000174a565cfd58bdd695118cab4f1&pos=105&src=GD_JOB_AD&srs=EI_JOBS&s=21&ao=4120). So I am pretty confident ML
is important

Looking at some data scientist jobs this is what I find even to get
selected into an [accelerated program](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2011384814/?eBP=CwEAAAF0pWdjPywntXvzgRXJ4BKRL3Hbil9_83pDATxuaTic8RTFOasMHSc1jvpTPcyIRng3Ufxa-hU4cNiCgsbK_WP0Yq8p0vwF3lBTf3-fb0qf-Kuki4KbYfk2h6fLNPuoRjGA2qQuEnJiRJ09qD5tGFiObo5v6cjhk5QpQBvodmyzPHuSibO0XSzgUWPE7bOL9C6KLaL242r-TM6fhssB-lG4u-m1eXsomDuZ_T1P83B3M10XzTSIqIGyjjINfvg1EKpdbZqzEnjqyF1zGJYCdnKfKwC3Uxbym0-a6TIS23YHGw5ABjl2ZVkBKsdI0CvLKwW9h7EZL4OOkrbi3lTAUZwMN0OjHt7D_KsvAFYU2HbMSepX14lU5nrnCxAyMlxLpCyP9GTiU2o93Q&recommendedFlavor=SCHOOL_RECRUIT&refId=1497270c-d242-475a-babd-7098c67907db&trackingId=Kz6jS4WRH6NTu5KlG%2Fl71Q%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_search_srp_jobs).

> Who are you?

Body at apple uses ML as well (it is a must for him). Although he
swears by other things like hypothesis testing using right variables
etc... Need to practice some DS problems. Where to find them though?


## Explaining logic for DS vs DA


salary?


## What to ask people?

How to transition into DS?

How did you transition into DS?

What would you suggest I do?



People who transitioned in real life... When I ask them they say
aply. 

I applied now I don't get any interview calls even for the simplest of
jobs.

so I need to do something .... Do I have the skills? 

What don't I have?

Is DEEP Learning the way to go?

I need statistics, ML and SQL ?????

## arnaud hubaux

https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-238-asml-with-arnaud-hubaux/

"I lead the development of performance applications for our
lithography machines. Those applications combines physics and machine
learning to detect defects or optimize corrections."

"At the same time, those machines are operating in completely sealed
environments. There is no access to the internet. And the designs of
the chips, the way the customers operate our machines, is completely
unknown to us."

1. 

"It learns from the context to further optimize the behavior of the
machine."


2. 

"The second type is, because every machine is very precise, but like
every piece of engineering, it drifts through time."

3. choosing features grounded in physics helps them deal with lack of
   dater.
   
4. Make system learn by itself... have multiple models compete with
   each other... and even do hyper-parameter tuning on the fly.
   
   
1. **Defect detection**

Customer tells x is ok y wafer is bad


2. every customer has different requirements. so non-transferable
   dater.
   
3. "Because if you look at what the real fab would be crunching, they
   would be producing those 20,000 wafers in a week. So we get 20,000
   in three months. So that's anyway good enough for us to get
   going. But the danger there is you could easily say, well, I have a
   sparse data set. So if I reach 60% accuracy, that is good enough. I
   know that when I will deploy it, I will reach 80%, 90%, 95%."


**Why?**

1. stochastic or systematic (recurring hardware issue)

scheduled down not good.

Explanability is key


**Dimensional reduction**


1. PCA
2. Physics based ("So the physics model is actually for every bit of
   information or every module that we know, we try to predict what is
   going to be the ideal shape versus what the actual shape is.")

Success, Finance, People, Store, Tech and so on. We will discuss the
team we have in mind for you during the final stages of your interview
process. Of course we take your preference into account too!


What does the application process look like?  

Online application -> online assessment (36 minutes) -> video or phone
call with recruiter -> first interview round (behavioral + case
interview) -> case day -> closing interview with one of the Picnic
founders


**Links of previous employers hype**

https://join.picnic.app/story/top-tier-consultancy-to-disruptive-startup

As Picnic is relatively small, and because we’re growing so fast –
you’re given responsibility straight away. Two weeks after I started,
I was doing the order forecasts. That’s a lot of responsibility. Many
of our processes rely on the forecasting; the products we buy, the
shoppers and runners we plan for, the development of the fleet. In
order to write the forecasts, I used the existing models based on
historical data. By incorporating the number of orders already placed,
we saw real improvement in the model. The process is ongoing, and each
day we use new tools to develop more involved and accurate models.

Next to this, I’m also coordinating the Sunday delivery roll-out.

- Cv run through with clear focus that I am an ME
- explanation of statistics assignement
- explanation of Image classification
- explanation of tableau


### feedback during interview

overall very positive (guy bought everything I said)

Correct CV to clearly explain I am a design engineer (people were
unsure if I had 4 years exp or not). 

Let's stick to conveying the truth.
	
## Design engineer overlay

Integration cluster to make sure that the proposed solutions by the FC
team work well with the normal processes of the scanner.

They test the solutions, do feasibility studies by sourcing the right
customer data. They fake being the customer and test their solutions
so that they don't break the system. They test the procedure.

It is more of a software role compared to my hardware role.

Almost all work is done in matlab.

You will learn a little bit of statistics(basic), none of the
semiconductor process and programming.

**Questions asked**

1. do you like less stake holder management

2. What do you like in your job and what don't you like

3. should you have done another masters?

4. explain an example of how you tested at a time (success story)?

5. What do you react to shit not working? how did you deal with the supplier


### same job but NTP side

what thomai does, seems sto be exactly what the function definition is...

**Position:**

Developing algorithms which focus on the inference of critical parameters in semiconductor devices from machine data.

**Tasks:**

• Design of parameter estimation algorithms, which enable and improve semiconductor metrology solutions, using both physical models and machine learning methods.
• Design of KPIs and KPI specs to track machine and algorithms performance.
• Outlier detection in high dimensional machine data.
• Data analysis and troubleshooting.
• Provide solutions, by having customer needs in mind.
• Project definition, functional breakdown and specifications.

**My understanding of tasks**

- "lots of data analysis" --> getting trends using Exploratory Data
Analysis

- Budget breakdowns

- associating fingerprint and root cause analysis

- trouble shooting

**My goals**

make recommendation, create data impact, insights statistics, setting
up testing, correlation analysis, 

I want high responsibility task 

**Questions asked**

Note: Everything in the cv is fair game for questioning

1. Tell me about a time when you did stake holder management?
   What sorts of challenges did you have?
   
   Time... discussed with
   Getting time from all the people was hard... Use teams, sometimes
   planning, no need for escalation.
   
   1. I identified and extended the scope of the assignement as it was
      not going to work. 
	  
   2. I identified who the stakeholders are Thermal, different design teams,
      recipes people, 
   
   3. Analysed their individual contributions and went back and forth
      to realize a minimal value along with another partner. 

2. how did you manage to reach all the stakeholders? What do you do
   when you were not able to reach them? Did you ever escalate?
   
   Answer expected is escalate...
   
3. Tell me a time when you did customer support?

5. Tell me about a time when you did root cause analysis?

4. How did you do sanity checks ? hot examples (I told them about
   checking to see what you expect and what is observed)
   
5. Explain what Adverserial validation is? and why it is required?

6. tell me a time about how 
7. what was your exact contribution in the statistics assignment? 

8. why should we hire you? what do you bring to the table?


**Other analysis I did (sent via email)**

Hi Tomai,

You had asked me earlier how I would do sanity checks to see whether a
code does what I expect it to. I don't know why I panicked, but I
always do some sanity checks. For example, when I perform any
operation on my dataset I do the following basic checks:

1. test the operation on a very simple minimal dataset that I can
   verify manually. This way I know the code works.
2. Once I implement an operation on the actual large dataset, I test
it with 2 examples to make sure I see what I expect.
3. I also check if the overall value make sense (Is the number in the
   right order of magnitude? etc.)

Hi Tomai and Jeroen,

You had asked if I have done something in between 1. basic statistics
and the 2. fraud detection assignment I have shown. Here is an example
troubleshooting assignment that I did at Mapper. Hope it is clear and
shows a bit about how I think.

**Situation**:

Our "Wafer Clamping module" (which consists of 10+ sub-modules) gets an
error message that we don't have enough water to make the clamp. So
the clamp fails.

To give an idea of complexity of each module: Each module takes a day
to assemble and verify by one person.

It's been only 2 months since I started and I don't know anything
about the module as I just started. I was expected to solve this,
nevertheless.

**Task**: Identify the issue and convince the team lead of the issue.

**Action**: 

0. **Basic sanity checks**

	- Is the water reservoir empty? *No*
	- Is the connection to the water reservoir shutoff by accident?
      *No*
	  
1. **Is it a software implementation failure?** Check the "expected
   Clamp process" (e.g., which valve should open/close and when) and
   the trace from the "Wafer Clamping Station" to see if they are in
   sync:
   
   *Everything checks out.*
   
2. **Is there evidence that the clamp process even works on another
   BUILD?** Check if this Clamp process has been tested before on
   another "Wafer clamping module":
   
   *Yes it has.*

3. **What is the difference between the two traces?** Check certain
   "critical features" (such as volume of water, volume of pressurized
   nitrogen), which would impact water performance between the
   "Working Wafer Clamp Module" and the "non-working Wafer clamp
   module".
   
   *Start pressures are the same but the final pressures are quite
   different.*
   
4. **Do the two systems have the exact same HARDWARE?** 

	- I explain my findings to people who have experience with this
    system, and there I got a clue that perhaps I had a smaller
    ORIFICE in the "non-working Wafer Clamp Station".
	
	- I start looking in the build sheets but I see no evidence of
	changes of the nozzle.

5. **Did someone forget to update the buildsheet?**

	- I wanted to test the "different Orifice" hypothesis,
      non-invasively if possible.
	  
	- Using ideal gas law and the traces of Pressures and Volumes from
      both the "Wafer Clamp Stations", I was able to PREDICT THE EXACT
      FINAL WATER LEVEL in the module in both cases accurately
      provided I assumed the bigger orifice for one system and smaller
      orifice for the "non-working wafer clamp station".
	  
	  
**Result**	  

- This helped identify what type of orifice I had in the Non-working
  Clamping Module
		
- Once this was changed everything started working as expected.

1. how do you network?


### 4th and 5th indrew prep

**Notes from indrew**

NTP feasibility classic product development (samsung)

Jens: 45 people, 15 people in functional cluster architect, owns roadmap for
the Next 5 years, 2 years before cs apps, app, 10 years in ASML…
application overlay OPO, Canon and asml system, MTBI

David: FC architect, 2007, always OPO, Smash alignment, bsaseliner,
NTP and product development Belgium

0. Why do you want to be part of this group? answer: started with
   physics/data work and now moved to soft skills/data work.

1. Regression vs  correlation

2. ML why future

3. Why trust my

	How many volvo cars are there… volvvo and teslas… volvos, no one
    trusts ML.

What sort of data do you work with?  Overlay data… not eager to share
data are companies, but you ask logs, FAP info etc...

Escalations not many in NTP… New node… improvements… , showing why you
don't meet said claimed performance, showing the benefit of options,
how existing products can show benefit, New options can we come up
with it,

DSP projects do that…

Mapper, OPO… David, why mapper , limited to actuators to change finger print
No reticle option, infinite
Correction capabilities
12 par + correct per field scnaner wasn't fast enough…
Actuations 3rd order effects, lens…
Slightly manipulate lens system… to get final result but for all fields.
 
What do you do in FC? Product development?  New estimaation models?
Finger print on wafer, 200 points of wafer, 38 par distortation 3800
parameters to define… 300 points… few points leading to projection on
an already existing space. And statistics… often NTP… customers don’t
want to share data, 5-6, Draw results from that… estimation, EPE. He
said that the team sometimes needs people to draw CI with enough
points even though they have only 5-6 wafers info. Sometimes they have
to draw uncertainties of the 300 points over the 5-6 wafers and "add
the uncertainties" together.

Estimation models, developing new models. Dense data, 300,
mathematical descriptions Models whats there in it? All wafers must
work…

Physics, linear algebra, programming? Algorithm team focusses on
mathematics, Learning, shapes, data analysis, NTP projects…

Collect data for not able to  300 sampling… 800 and 1000 points

What is life cycle? 1.5 years

Study sometimes are done as well.

Diff between NTP and prod development (data is where you start , investigation approach)

Get idea of solutions… Litho insight, prototypes, Java, matlab for
prototyping…


What is the difference between you and CS? missed this Q....

1. Regression vs  correlation

2. ML why future

3. Why trust my

**Questions for them**

How is CS overlay different from you guys?

what data are you looking at? machine data and overlay data?

What will I learn? What will I develop in?

How much time do you spend on analysing data, extracting info, vs
communication vs presentation?

**What does the job entail my version**

Help customer with software tools necessary to improve his OPO.

Understand what the customer wants and why he has overlay issues. You
do that by looking at the data from the FAP...

breakdowns, 

feasibility and help them achive where they want to go?

extract insights from data

make experiments with customer...

## iron hack

Recently I got in touch with this women adrianna from ironhack and she
showed me the alumni network and what potentially I could do to get a
job. I want to use the alumini network and do the following

**Discussion**

4 workshops + last week full of career stuff

Before Covid --> 85% within 1-6 months

After Covid (assumed as since 2020) --> 67% 1-3 months placement rate
and 76% in 1-6 months.

*Of course for me the question is how they calculated these numbers?,
real numbers could be lower*

24 students 1 class, 1 TA per class.

---

Who to conduct? 

1. get feedback on CV
2. ask them how they did it?
3. ask them what I need to do?


**What to get from them?**

4. get company names to apply
5. understand what they did other than the bootcamp?
6. Do they know other people in the same space?

Can they refer you?

**The right group**

1. Conduct people who recently graduated, 
2. who have background in mech 

**initial message**

Hi  

Can I connect with you to ask you a few questions about your
experience with moving to Data Analytics/Science and regarding
ironhack?

Thanks.

Regards,
Thej

**Later message**

Like you I want to move into data analytics/Science. I am unable to
get any interviews even. I am really wondering what I can do to
improve my cv to get an interview.

1. Is ironhack something you recommend?
2. What from ironhack do you think helped you to get the job in Aigent
   for example?
3. I have done Coursera courses, fastai, sql courses and kaggle competitions. 

I shall attach my CV. Any feedback you can give is much appreciated. I
applied to around 80 companies but not one interview.

**initial message other group**


Hi,

I am reaching out to you for advice. Like you I want to move into data
analytics/Science. I am unable to get any interviews even. I am really
wondering what I can do to improve my cv to get a job in the end.

1.  I have done Coursera courses (Capstone series), fastai, sql
    courses and kaggle competitions and still failed to get an
    interview even with over 80 applications. Do you have any
    suggestions for me? (CV attached)
2. Is ironhack something you recommend?
3. What from ironhack do you think helped you to get the job in Aigent
   for example?

Any feedback you can give is much appreciated.

Thanks.

Regards,
Thej


**the stats according to ironhack**


**Goal**

Send out requests to 15 people from the alumini network.

Find people who have done it and copy their way... keep year as close
to 2021 as possible, person as international as possible and carrier
with few years of exp in some other field.

## body--> what I should look for in a japs

1. design of experiements (56 jobs)
root cause analysis

1. ""productivity improvement projects and the work typically involves
   a lot of (machine and customer) data crunching, detailed breakdowns
   of tact time of stages, handlers and track, bottle neck analyses
   and the creation of options and solutions to enhance throughput and
   output""
   
   Customer support
   
   hands dirty with data (difficult data) comprehensive data
   story.... workign with unclean data answer data.
   
2. I look at data from ASML's customers to suggest customised
   productivity improvements based on their usage of lithography
   machines. I am involved in new product introduction, and multiple
   stages of the product generation process. I also do data analysis
   and reporting as part of application and business support.
   
   
3. Data mining with some home made tools, to suggest improvements

Big data:
