I am considering doing some courses from Poverty Action Lab such as Data Science for Social Scientists, Microeconomics, and the challenges to Global Poverty. Is it a good place to start?"

Sounds good to me!

### Anjan Gantapara

Example did coursera machine learning course after his phd in
computational stuff to get to a job in DS. Seems knowledgeable in
statistics after which Philips hired him.

"I employed advanced Statistical Mechanics concepts and modern Monte
Carlo techniques to simulate micro- and nano-meter size anisotropic
particles and elucidate their phase behavior as a function of various
macroscopic controllable parameters."

### Exercises

Data Camp
Kaggle
http://datasciencemasters.org/ 

https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview


### So far

I have an fb post coming with some examples of what people did...

https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-went-from-zero-coding-skills-to-data-scientist-in-6-months-c2207b65f2f3

It takes 6 months...

Based on the above, Statistics, experiment design, scientific method
expertise

SQL data analysis course etc... 

https://medium.com/fully-understood/how-to-learn-machine-learning-from-scratch-and-for-free-5753fa2170dd


https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-got-4-data-science-offers-and-doubled-my-income-2-months-after-being-laid-off-b3b6d2de6938


## Ideally 

I would like to copy the people who made the transition

**Course in ML**

- fast ai (detailed AF) [100 hrs]<-- critically acclaimed by peter and
  this other guy

- random course on coursera for [60hrs]

- Just start with Kaggle and see where it gets you (quick and dirty?)
  [unknown]
  
- https://cloud.google.com/training/data-ml

**Course in Statistics basics**

- Khan academy all questions and answers AP stats?

- Maybe: https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html

- Statistics I Princeton / Coursera

- Data science for social scientists

- microeconomics

But these are books :(

- https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/

- Statistical sleuth 

**Experience with projects**

- experience through kaggle competitions [unknown]

**Sql course**

https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/SQL/SelfPaced/course/ ?



**Tableau learning**


**Prepare projects list**

- shiny nlp (DS)
- kaggle ML (ML)

Work on


### Ideally 2

**starting at kaggle**

for ML... and do exams. as and when necessarey learn from fast.ai

**Peter suggested Pythiath course:**
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/?fbclid=IwAR0a-S06xLRHlFWkCndGe8sjrTMgbAJbteL9HNlcyzmX9azcod-Bzo53KLI

**Statistics course**
Finish Khan Academy Statistics and Probability. 

https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-learning NOT SURE ABUOT THIS!

Do some course...

**ML course**

fast.ai
kaggle
DATACAMP

**DS course**

https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-of-data-analysis-part-1-statistics-usi

coursera course [done already]

**SQL course**


I would like to do the MIT course, Statistics course, follow it up
with heavy KAGGLE for ML (more info on fast.ai) and statistics as
needed.. More problems on data camp


## Examples (tbd)

**Look for examples regarding?**
https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-lewis-42131224/?originalSubdomain=au

Above also did a machinelearning course but that was part of the
DSS. prior to jumping into DS FT job. Of course shes much better than
me as a base line with her statistical knowledge. This was her
original [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/@katemarielewis).

vadehi
amrithpal
etc...
## Target 3 months

I want to pick up a statistics course and a DS course and an ML
course. Mainly do examples and see how that goes.


## Explaining logic for ML being first action

I need "ML". Because ASML swears by it. Peter thinks it is
important. ING aslo [seems to want ML](https://www.glassdoor.nl/Vacature/amsterdam-senior-data-engineer-vacatures-SRCH_IL.0,9_IC3064478_KO10,30.htm?rdserp=true&jl=3645420576&guid=00000174a565cfd58bdd695118cab4f1&pos=105&src=GD_JOB_AD&srs=EI_JOBS&s=21&ao=4120). So I am pretty confident ML
is important

Looking at some data scientist jobs this is what I find even to get
selected into an [accelerated program](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2011384814/?eBP=CwEAAAF0pWdjPywntXvzgRXJ4BKRL3Hbil9_83pDATxuaTic8RTFOasMHSc1jvpTPcyIRng3Ufxa-hU4cNiCgsbK_WP0Yq8p0vwF3lBTf3-fb0qf-Kuki4KbYfk2h6fLNPuoRjGA2qQuEnJiRJ09qD5tGFiObo5v6cjhk5QpQBvodmyzPHuSibO0XSzgUWPE7bOL9C6KLaL242r-TM6fhssB-lG4u-m1eXsomDuZ_T1P83B3M10XzTSIqIGyjjINfvg1EKpdbZqzEnjqyF1zGJYCdnKfKwC3Uxbym0-a6TIS23YHGw5ABjl2ZVkBKsdI0CvLKwW9h7EZL4OOkrbi3lTAUZwMN0OjHt7D_KsvAFYU2HbMSepX14lU5nrnCxAyMlxLpCyP9GTiU2o93Q&recommendedFlavor=SCHOOL_RECRUIT&refId=1497270c-d242-475a-babd-7098c67907db&trackingId=Kz6jS4WRH6NTu5KlG%2Fl71Q%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_search_srp_jobs).

> Who are you?

> fantastic foundation for developing further and future-proofing your

Body at apple uses ML as well (it is a must for him). Although he
swears by other things like hypothesis testing using right variables
etc... Need to practice some DS problems. Where to find them though?


## Explaining logic for DS vs DA


salary?


## What to ask people?

How to transition into DS?

How did you transition into DS?

What would you suggest I do?



People who transitioned in real life... When I ask them they say
aply. 

I applied now I don't get any interview calls even for the simplest of
jobs.

so I need to do something .... Do I have the skills? 

What don't I have?

Is DEEP Learning the way to go?

I need statistics, ML and SQL ?????

## arnaud hubaux

https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-238-asml-with-arnaud-hubaux/

"I lead the development of performance applications for our
lithography machines. Those applications combines physics and machine
learning to detect defects or optimize corrections."

"At the same time, those machines are operating in completely sealed
environments. There is no access to the internet. And the designs of
the chips, the way the customers operate our machines, is completely
unknown to us."

1. 

"It learns from the context to further optimize the behavior of the
machine."


1. 

"The second type is, because every machine is very precise, but like
every piece of engineering, it drifts through time."

1. choosing features grounded in physics helps them deal with lack of
   dater.
   
2. Make system learn by itself... have multiple models compete with
   each other... and even do hyper-parameter tuning on the fly.
   
   
3. **Defect detection**

Customer tells x is ok y wafer is bad


1. every customer has different requirements. so non-transferable
   dater.
   
2. "Because if you look at what the real fab would be crunching, they
   would be producing those 20,000 wafers in a week. So we get 20,000
   in three months. So that's anyway good enough for us to get
   going. But the danger there is you could easily say, well, I have a
   sparse data set. So if I reach 60% accuracy, that is good enough. I
   know that when I will deploy it, I will reach 80%, 90%, 95%."


**Why?**

1. stochastic or systematic (recurring hardware issue)

scheduled down not good.

Explanability is key


**Dimensional reduction**


1. PCA
2. Physics based ("So the physics model is actually for every bit of
   information or every module that we know, we try to predict what is
   going to be the ideal shape versus what the actual shape is.")

Success, Finance, People, Store, Tech and so on. We will discuss the
team we have in mind for you during the final stages of your interview
process. Of course we take your preference into account too!


What does the application process look like?  

Online application -> online assessment (36 minutes) -> video or phone
call with recruiter -> first interview round (behavioral + case
interview) -> case day -> closing interview with one of the Picnic
founders


**Links of previous employers hype**

https://join.picnic.app/story/top-tier-consultancy-to-disruptive-startup

As Picnic is relatively small, and because we’re growing so fast –
you’re given responsibility straight away. Two weeks after I started,
I was doing the order forecasts. That’s a lot of responsibility. Many
of our processes rely on the forecasting; the products we buy, the
shoppers and runners we plan for, the development of the fleet. In
order to write the forecasts, I used the existing models based on
historical data. By incorporating the number of orders already placed,
we saw real improvement in the model. The process is ongoing, and each
day we use new tools to develop more involved and accurate models.

Next to this, I’m also coordinating the Sunday delivery roll-out.

- Cv run through with clear focus that I am an ME
- explanation of statistics assignement
- explanation of Image classification
- explanation of tableau


### feedback during interview

overall very positive (guy bought everything I said)

Correct CV to clearly explain I am a design engineer (people were
unsure if I had 4 years exp or not). 

Let's stick to conveying the truth.
	
## Design engineer overlay

Integration cluster to make sure that the proposed solutions by the FC
team work well with the normal processes of the scanner.

They test the solutions, do feasibility studies by sourcing the right
customer data. They fake being the customer and test their solutions
so that they don't break the system. They test the procedure.

It is more of a software role compared to my hardware role.

Almost all work is done in matlab.

You will learn a little bit of statistics(basic), none of the
semiconductor process and programming.

**Questions asked**

1. do you like less stake holder management

2. What do you like in your job and what don't you like

3. should you have done another masters?

4. explain an example of how you tested at a time (success story)?

5. What do you react to shit not working? how did you deal with the supplier


### same job but NTP side

what thomai does, seems sto be exactly what the function definition is...

**Position:**

Developing algorithms which focus on the inference of critical parameters in semiconductor devices from machine data.

**Tasks:**

• Design of parameter estimation algorithms, which enable and improve semiconductor metrology solutions, using both physical models and machine learning methods.
• Design of KPIs and KPI specs to track machine and algorithms performance.
• Outlier detection in high dimensional machine data.
• Data analysis and troubleshooting.
• Provide solutions, by having customer needs in mind.
• Project definition, functional breakdown and specifications.

**My understanding of tasks**

- "lots of data analysis" --> getting trends using Exploratory Data
Analysis

- Budget breakdowns

- associating fingerprint and root cause analysis

- trouble shooting

**My goals**

make recommendation, create data impact, insights statistics, setting
up testing, correlation analysis, 

I want high responsibility task 

**Questions asked**

Note: Everything in the cv is fair game for questioning

1. Tell me about a time when you did stake holder management?
   What sorts of challenges did you have?
   
   Time... discussed with
   Getting time from all the people was hard... Use teams, sometimes
   planning, no need for escalation.
   
   1. I identified and extended the scope of the assignement as it was
      not going to work. 
	  
   2. I identified who the stakeholders are Thermal, different design teams,
      recipes people, 
   
   3. Analysed their individual contributions and went back and forth
      to realize a minimal value along with another partner. 

2. how did you manage to reach all the stakeholders? What do you do
   when you were not able to reach them? Did you ever escalate?
   
   Answer expected is escalate...
   
3. Tell me a time when you did customer support?

4. Tell me about a time when you did root cause analysis?

5. How did you do sanity checks ? hot examples (I told them about
   checking to see what you expect and what is observed)
   
6. Explain what Adverserial validation is? and why it is required?

7. tell me a time about how 
8. what was your exact contribution in the statistics assignment? 

9. why should we hire you? what do you bring to the table?


**Other analysis I did (sent via email)**

Hi Tomai,

You had asked me earlier how I would do sanity checks to see whether a
code does what I expect it to. I don't know why I panicked, but I
always do some sanity checks. For example, when I perform any
operation on my dataset I do the following basic checks:

1. test the operation on a very simple minimal dataset that I can
   verify manually. This way I know the code works.
2. Once I implement an operation on the actual large dataset, I test
it with 2 examples to make sure I see what I expect.
3. I also check if the overall value make sense (Is the number in the
   right order of magnitude? etc.)

Hi Tomai and Jeroen,

You had asked if I have done something in between 1. basic statistics
and the 2. fraud detection assignment I have shown. Here is an example
troubleshooting assignment that I did at Mapper. Hope it is clear and
shows a bit about how I think.

**Situation**:

Our "Wafer Clamping module" (which consists of 10+ sub-modules) gets an
error message that we don't have enough water to make the clamp. So
the clamp fails.

To give an idea of complexity of each module: Each module takes a day
to assemble and verify by one person.

It's been only 2 months since I started and I don't know anything
about the module as I just started. I was expected to solve this,
nevertheless.

**Task**: Identify the issue and convince the team lead of the issue.

**Action**: 

1. **Basic sanity checks**

	- Is the water reservoir empty? *No*
	- Is the connection to the water reservoir shutoff by accident?
      *No*
	  
2. **Is it a software implementation failure?** Check the "expected
   Clamp process" (e.g., which valve should open/close and when) and
   the trace from the "Wafer Clamping Station" to see if they are in
   sync:
   
   *Everything checks out.*
   
3. **Is there evidence that the clamp process even works on another
   BUILD?** Check if this Clamp process has been tested before on
   another "Wafer clamping module":
   
   *Yes it has.*

4. **What is the difference between the two traces?** Check certain
   "critical features" (such as volume of water, volume of pressurized
   nitrogen), which would impact water performance between the
   "Working Wafer Clamp Module" and the "non-working Wafer clamp
   module".
   
   *Start pressures are the same but the final pressures are quite
   different.*
   
5. **Do the two systems have the exact same HARDWARE?** 

	- I explain my findings to people who have experience with this
    system, and there I got a clue that perhaps I had a smaller
    ORIFICE in the "non-working Wafer Clamp Station".
	
	- I start looking in the build sheets but I see no evidence of
	changes of the nozzle.

6. **Did someone forget to update the buildsheet?**

	- I wanted to test the "different Orifice" hypothesis,
      non-invasively if possible.
	  
	- Using ideal gas law and the traces of Pressures and Volumes from
      both the "Wafer Clamp Stations", I was able to PREDICT THE EXACT
      FINAL WATER LEVEL in the module in both cases accurately
      provided I assumed the bigger orifice for one system and smaller
      orifice for the "non-working wafer clamp station".
	  
	  
**Result**	  

- This helped identify what type of orifice I had in the Non-working
  Clamping Module
		
- Once this was changed everything started working as expected.

1. how do you network?


### 4th and 5th indrew prep

**Notes from indrew**

NTP feasibility classic product development (samsung)

Jens: 45 people, 15 people in functional cluster architect, owns roadmap for
the Next 5 years, 2 years before cs apps, app, 10 years in ASML…
application overlay OPO, Canon and asml system, MTBI

David: FC architect, 2007, always OPO, Smash alignment, bsaseliner,
NTP and product development Belgium

1. Why do you want to be part of this group? answer: started with
   physics/data work and now moved to soft skills/data work.

2. Regression vs  correlation

3. ML why future

4. Why trust my

	How many volvo cars are there… volvvo and teslas… volvos, no one
    trusts ML.

What sort of data do you work with?  Overlay data… not eager to share
data are companies, but you ask logs, FAP info etc...

Escalations not many in NTP… New node… improvements… , showing why you
don't meet said claimed performance, showing the benefit of options,
how existing products can show benefit, New options can we come up
with it,

DSP projects do that…

Mapper, OPO… David, why mapper , limited to actuators to change finger print
No reticle option, infinite
Correction capabilities
12 par + correct per field scnaner wasn't fast enough…
Actuations 3rd order effects, lens…
Slightly manipulate lens system… to get final result but for all fields.
 
What do you do in FC? Product development?  New estimaation models?
Finger print on wafer, 200 points of wafer, 38 par distortation 3800
parameters to define… 300 points… few points leading to projection on
an already existing space. And statistics… often NTP… customers don’t
want to share data, 5-6, Draw results from that… estimation, EPE. He
said that the team sometimes needs people to draw CI with enough
points even though they have only 5-6 wafers info. Sometimes they have
to draw uncertainties of the 300 points over the 5-6 wafers and "add
the uncertainties" together.

Estimation models, developing new models. Dense data, 300,
mathematical descriptions Models whats there in it? All wafers must
work…

Physics, linear algebra, programming? Algorithm team focusses on
mathematics, Learning, shapes, data analysis, NTP projects…

Collect data for not able to  300 sampling… 800 and 1000 points

What is life cycle? 1.5 years

Study sometimes are done as well.

Diff between NTP and prod development (data is where you start , investigation approach)

Get idea of solutions… Litho insight, prototypes, Java, matlab for
prototyping…


What is the difference between you and CS? missed this Q....

**Questions from them**

1. Why do you want to be part of this group? answer: started with
   physics/data work and now moved to soft skills/data work.

2. Regression vs  correlation

3. ML why future

4. Why trust my

**Questions for them**

How is CS overlay different from you guys?

what data are you looking at? machine data and overlay data?

What will I learn? What will I develop in?

How much time do you spend on analysing data, extracting info, vs
communication vs presentation?

**What does the job entail my version**

Help customer with software tools necessary to improve his OPO.

Understand what the customer wants and why he has overlay issues. You
do that by looking at the data from the FAP...

breakdowns, 

feasibility and help them achive where they want to go?

extract insights from data

make experiments with customer...

## iron hack

Recently I got in touch with this women adrianna from ironhack and she
showed me the alumni network and what potentially I could do to get a
job. I want to use the alumini network and do the following

**Discussion**

4 workshops + last week full of career stuff

Before Covid --> 85% within 1-6 months

After Covid (assumed as since 2020) --> 67% 1-3 months placement rate
and 76% in 1-6 months.

*Of course for me the question is how they calculated these numbers?,
real numbers could be lower*

24 students 1 class, 1 TA per class.

---

Who to conduct? 

1. get feedback on CV
2. ask them how they did it?
3. ask them what I need to do?


**What to get from them?**

1. get company names to apply
2. understand what they did other than the bootcamp?
3. Do they know other people in the same space?

Can they refer you?

**The right group**

1. Conduct people who recently graduated, 
2. who have background in mech 

**initial message**

Hi  

Can I connect with you to ask you a few questions about your
experience with moving to Data Analytics/Science and regarding
ironhack?

Thanks.

Regards,
Thej

**Later message**

Like you I want to move into data analytics/Science. I am unable to
get any interviews even. I am really wondering what I can do to
improve my cv to get an interview.

1. Is ironhack something you recommend?
2. What from ironhack do you think helped you to get the job in Aigent
   for example?
3. I have done Coursera courses, fastai, sql courses and kaggle competitions. 

I shall attach my CV. Any feedback you can give is much appreciated. I
applied to around 80 companies but not one interview.

**initial message other group**


Hi,

I am reaching out to you for advice. Like you I want to move into data
analytics/Science. I am unable to get any interviews even. I am really
wondering what I can do to improve my cv to get a job in the end.

1.  I have done Coursera courses (Capstone series), fastai, sql
    courses and kaggle competitions and still failed to get an
    interview even with over 80 applications. Do you have any
    suggestions for me? (CV attached)
2. Is ironhack something you recommend?
3. What from ironhack do you think helped you to get the job in Aigent
   for example?

Any feedback you can give is much appreciated.

Thanks.

Regards,
Thej


**the stats according to ironhack**


**Goal**

Send out requests to 15 people from the alumini network.

Find people who have done it and copy their way... keep year as close
to 2021 as possible, person as international as possible and carrier
with few years of exp in some other field.

## body--> what I should look for in a japs

1. design of experiements (56 jobs)
root cause analysis

2. ""productivity improvement projects and the work typically involves
   a lot of (machine and customer) data crunching, detailed breakdowns
   of tact time of stages, handlers and track, bottle neck analyses
   and the creation of options and solutions to enhance throughput and
   output""
   
   Customer support
   
   hands dirty with data (difficult data) comprehensive data
   story.... workign with unclean data answer data.
   
3. I look at data from ASML's customers to suggest customised
   productivity improvements based on their usage of lithography
   machines. I am involved in new product introduction, and multiple
   stages of the product generation process. I also do data analysis
   and reporting as part of application and business support.
   
   
4. Data mining with some home made tools, to suggest improvements

Big data:

## other options

1. internhship

Check out dealroom (Nick Deimeters)

1. Jeroen pdeng

2. apply again after changing cv

3. Some program like xcellarated or xomnia or youngcapital


## Dealroom.co

They gave me a case study on webscraping and duplicate detection.

1. There were around 40 applications for this internship. After one
   month they basically give the same responsibility as a person in
   the company (cheap ass fuckers).
   
2. They had 4 people at the assignment level and they might select
   3-4.
   
3. Spoke with the lead, who is iranian, giving hasan vibes.

Feedback on webscraping: Differt exceptions to be handled
differently. Don't use print... Takes a lot of time.

Feedback on duplicate detection: You did a very simple case, you could
have considered other cases, like just the address, cleaning the upper
case and lower case etc...

It's not illegal to get data from a public datasite, or startup
data. Even with login it is a grey area. It is what someone would do
personally so it is ok... we are just automating it.

More than half of the team is 

1. Make resume 1 page and highlight important stuff. People spend 10s
   on a resume...




## Ikea

### preparing questions

1. TMAY (done)

2. ikea values and how they fit?

	- caring for people and planet (use EA) (sustainability focus,
      programs in other countries)
	- cost conscious (make more out of less, Kaggle competitions top
      20% and 10%)
	- simplicity (We are informal, pragmatic and see bureaucracy as
      our biggest enemy.)
	- give and take (responsibility 9 encoder relentlessly pursue it until)
	- lead by example
	- Different (question existing solutions, think in unconventional
      ways)
3. Why ikea

	- high impact
	- reach to millions and billions of people
	- new e-commerce line (relatively not much done) (low hanging fruit)
	- big organization (possibility to learn from others and grow)
	- against buerocracies (We are informal, pragmatic and see
      bureaucracy as our biggest enemy.)
	
4. What is a mistake you made in the past

   3. Analysed their individual contributions and went back and forth
      to realize a minimal value along with another partner. 

3. how did you manage to reach all the stakeholders? What do you do
   when you were not able to reach them? Did you ever escalate?
   
   Answer expected is escalate...
   
4. Tell me a time when you did customer support?

### Actual interview ikea

**What they are looking for**

Someone who is able to execute data visions with the help of a sr Data
Science.

Cross functionally is able to collaborate...

Business-oriented, bit of data eng ETL and docker pyspark
capabilities.

People capable of managing stakeholders

**Questions**

- Hard to hear feedback and how you went about it (presentation)

- What are you proud of and not proud of (in life I said EA and
  certain ways I made decisions in the past)
  
- What type of people do you need around

- They  need an alignment person

- What do you expect in the first three months

- explain a data science work right from requirements to modelling

- They want to have in-house people calling hte shots and not from
  consultancies.
  
- Can you tell me more about your hobbies(I said I am not that person
  anymore), i do other things with my limited time

### IKEA case indrew

1. Take us through your assignment
   
   - Json to pandas DF
   - Clean all columns so that units matched. (assumed I didn't need
     to match PPP current ratios)
   - Look at EU And canada countries/cities based on "Euro" identified
     all income related values and multiplied by 1.18 **using
     value_unit ()**
   - Pivot the data so that indicator name becomes 
   - Remove countries and keep cities
   - Log, Select NAN handling strategy, Scale
   - PCA, Kmeans using silouette scores and plot clusters 
   - Plot clusters and visualize with PCA
   - Plot histograms
   
2. What took time? Pivoting, plotting as I wanted them, initial issue
   without Log, understanding that it was a log issue and implementing
   it in the right order, pandas slicing, plotting with np.logspace

3. Why Log?, why pivite? why scale? why NAN

	Why scale?
	
	Don't want importance of a variable to be decided by it's
    size. You want all variables to be treated the same. Large
    variables affect distance dis-propotionately.
	
	Why log?
	
	to form clusters in 10-100 and 100000-1mill
	
4. explain results of the clustering

- Ideally we would like ratios so that we can see everything in one
  graph
- green is a well developed country city looks like, large populations
  and higher incomes of all and 
- blue is also well developed
- include ppp ratios, plot on maps, more detailed explanation of claims

- red is in the middle

5. explain results of the histogram

6. Why kmeans

Most well known, sklearn chart on how the algos can work, good for
even size cluster, need to explore toher types

1. prep for indrew
   - what are the axis
   - what slowed you down
   - explain the whole process (key htings you saw like countries,
     other values hidden and needed to be converted)
	 - other directions you would like to look at? such as was there
     similarity due to country
	 
   - other indrew questions
   
Do the same prep as last time.


**Actual questions**

Let's go to the indrew. I took them through the case. They just
listened fully. Told them about 

- how I check things
- how I use log or ln 
- how I still did imputing even though I didn't need to
- Showed them the clusters
- explained to them with the clusters on what sort of countries they
  are. 
- I also told them what I want to do in the future with time
  segmentation and they bought it. (2008 vs 2025 work)
- and that was it. They had not quesitons and they said they were
  impressed and happy with the thoroughness of how I do thinking. 
  
John data scientist is from Pricing and is a data scientist but has
worked in baysian analysis and pushed Machine Learning in IKEA since
2015 or so.

Noah was in CS now is in management telecom and finance and doing some
masters in digital messaging now.

1. 2-3 slides on research and convey it to new non statistics people

	I said one slide on claim, one on the evidence and one of
    important clusters where you prioritize the next city of attack
    based out of the important cluster.

	It was very nice to see encouraging and heads shaking.

2. What KPIs would ikea be interested in... Cost, revenue and value
   pice in revenue, supply chain, stores opening.
   
3. where would ikea use  Machine Learning in consumer and market
   insights
   
   Forecasting sales, forcasting revenue, 
   New markets to break into, missing cities to break into, clustreing
   is a form of unsupervised Machine Learning

4. what was hardest?

	Getting to the point where I know which direction to go with the
    data. It took me one full day to just get there.


They didn't ask me anything in depth. i was allowed to jsut answer.


There are three groups --> Consumer insights (Data Science and DE
together types, NLP), competitors compass and Customer satisfaction.

I clearly told them Data Science of puzzling out is important for me.


John told me he likes the support he gets to do things in ikea. and
that he would like ikea to improve it's decision making process. with
many stakeholders befor you get to a decision..


	
### Assignment prep

> As from what I understood the assignment will be around
> cluster/segmentation analysis; with machine learning as a bonus. I
> don’t know if this helps you or makes any sense – but hopefully it
> gives you a bit of an understanding

1. types of Machine Learning

2. clustering statquest

3. segmentation analysis (example customer segmentation)

4. find example 

5. and reproduce

6. do your own example with fraud detection data


**Types of ML**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN7ypxC7838

1. Supervised

	1. regression (continuous variables)
		- linear regression
		- multiple regression
		- polynomial regression
		- decision tree
		- random tree (multiple dts using bootstrapped datasets)
		- xgboost
		- nueral network
	2. classification (discrete)
		- logistic regression
		- Support vector machine (sounds like multiple regression but
          for classification)
		- naive bayes
		- DT, rf and nn

2. unsupervised

	- clustering 
		- kmeans
		- hirarchecal
		- mean shift
		- density based
	- dimensionality reduction
		- feature elemination
		- feature extraction
		- PCA

### **K-means clustering**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b5d3muPQmA

https://www.kaggle.com/thejravichandran/kmeans-learning

- k stands for how many clusters you want to identify.
- process
  - standardize (normalize)
  - choose k random points for clustering
  - now go over every point and classify them as belonging to cluster
    based on "distance"
  - Calculate mean of all the different clusters
  - Repeat step 2. Stop when you see no change in clustering
  - track variation of different clusters and start over till N outcomes
    are reached. 
- variation in cluster around different clusters shows how good or bad
  out clustering is.
- **what value for k?**
  - Plot silouette coefficient vs k And take highest sc k value
  - find elbow in varience vs k plot (varience decrease stops becoming
    worth while)
  - look for uniform k value and highest siloutte coeff in the
    siloutte sample histogram plot
- distance => euclidean distance (basically sqrt(sumsq(x-x1,x-x2...)))

- **uses:** clustering to see how each sample is different? and using
  it in the Machine Learning model
  
what about categorical variables???

Are we expected to normalize the results? what are the caveats?

It is **only for numerical** variables and not for
categorical. Ordinal, maybe.

**Coding**:

- nan strategy
- making categories with kmeans
- making sense of categories with kmeans
- 



https://www.kaggle.com/fabiendaniel/customer-segmentation

Top voted stuff but too much info

https://www.kaggle.com/mgmarques/customer-segmentation-and-market-basket-analysis

Nice plots and info above... Does not explain the point of seeing the distribution.

- to keep it mind
  - check number of elements in a cluster
  - what to do categorical variables?
   Perhaps as [here](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/9385/67821), maybe we just [one hot encode](https://pbpython.com/categorical-encoding.html) them?
  - get silhouette score and plot the variables to visibly see the
    variables and how they're clustering is...
  - compare different variables for each cluster (using avg for
    example), or look at the centroid values ...
  - log the scaled values or not?
  - get deeper into clustering using hierarchical

1. get kmeans of several values stopping at ones with least variation
2. check elbow plot
3. check silouette score for each
4. plot silouette score histogram for each cluster
5. plot another variable and the different clusters to see where you
   are at.
6. hirarchical clustering example with categorical variable?
7. PCA
8. linear and multivariate 
9. how to... do linear and multivariate
10. plotting basics

11. Look at the case ikea on github?

**Hierarchical clustering** associated with heatmaps and dendograms

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xHsRkOdVwo

https://www.kaggle.com/vipulgandhi/hierarchical-clustering-explanation

What two things are most similar. I have used it in the context of
trying to find out what two variables are close to each other.

- HC heatmap shows rows or columns "similar" to each other
  - e.g., heatmap of genes and samples. 
- process
  - compare every row with each other on how "similar" it is.
  - make the first cluster on the most similarest
  - then do again and again and make the dendogram and arrangement
  - height of dendogram is the first cluster and the most similar

- assessing new data points and their cluster
  - centroid
  - closest
  - furthest

- "similar" ==> euclidean distance is used a lot
		    ==> Manhattan distance --> sum(abs(diff))
- choice is arbitrary. They give different outcomes.

**Segmentation analysis**

What should I prepare for, last time I had issues with working on
matplotlib and interpretting the results.

For interpretting the results I want to ask body for feedback, and for
matplotlib I will just do a course now?

Wow, you've clearly given it a lot of thought! Here are some tips

1. Check these people, they are amazing and def willing to help too!
https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/jmperafan > did like a million
courses like you and presents himself really well.
https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/yusichen > works at TakeAway and
they are looking for new people!

2. Finding jobs LinkedIn, Indeed and Networking > linkedin but also

1. Applying I applied to about 30 businesses but I was really picky!
Sometimes got rejected because I didn't have any mathematical
background. Sometimes did an assessment and failed. Sometimes I said I
didn't want to after speaking to them. Depends and all part of the
proceaa. Dont lose hope :)

FYI: I found Careerscore a nice platform to keep track of all of my
applications. Give yourself a clear goal e.g. 5 applications per week.

1. CV

Make sure it is 1 page. Yes you might have to delete some info. Make
sure you do not put everything on your CV. Only the things that you
think are relevant for the specific job you are applying for. So yes,
edit your CV for every application. Use the words and systems from the
job application, make them bold, make sure the recruiter immediately
understands the link between you and the job application.

And second, make it more personal. I would add a picture. Make sure
your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date (here you can add all the info
that didn't make the cut to your CV) Include a short and clear summary
of what you are looking for and why (what is your passion). Make sure
you know who you are, what your values are, your strengths, your
weaknesses. Use CrystalKnows to get to check what your LinkedIn
profile says about you (and check recruiters profiles before an
intervuew/writing cv so that you van alter your communication style to
their liking)

If you want some inspiration of personality traits:
https://www.ccsdut.org/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=257&dataid=912&FileName=character-personality-traits.pdf

Define the job role you want to apply for. Make sure you know what
kind of job you are looking for. Use it in your LinkedIn title,
summary and CV.  For tips :

Norbert 

- Good morning
- Name
- I spoke last week regarding the consultant data analyst position
- I was wondering if the applications have been processed (lo)
- typical times it takes for 


### Call with Norbert from PWC

Had a 10 min call for [this position](https://web.archive.org/web/20210922064705/https://www.pwc.nl/en/careers/description.html?wdjobreqid=210619WD&wdcountry=NLD&jobtitle=Consultant%2520Data%2520Analytics&wdjobsite=Global_Campus_Careers), after 2 weeks and having
taken down the application and then when I reached out he re-opend the
vacancy.

Called at 8:52 am. He was kind and ready to talk for 2 mins. He
remembered me. 

1. How does working with PWC work, one mentor, one buddy and you also
   work in a team so that should be ok.
   
2. It sounds exciting that we get the chance to work in PWC with
   different types of fields. 
   
   Yes you get depending on the projects we win, but in general yeah,
   until you become an expert... 
   
   
3. I am a lateral entry, non-traditional masters, 


	But you have exp, maybe there are senior roles, I said that am
    afraid to be stuck inbetween. He said hiring managers have to
    decide what they want not sure how they will weight the bootcamps.
	
4. Now about the cover letter he asked to add the following:

	- Make 1 page now it is concise
	- What you have done?

## Thoughts sep 26 th

What are my options?

1. Ikea like company gives job before dec ( :( )

2. Data Analyst at ASML

	I thing this is not a Data Analyst job, WTF do you mean? I mean I wont
	get any transferable skill as most of it is going to be domain
	knowledge of seeing a fingerprint and identifying why it's
	happening. Breakdown budgets and plots of overlay are already there, I
	just have to use that stuff and find the root cause. Unlike in the
	real job. It's in Matlab for fucks sake, there is no bigdata, there is
	no python, my fear is there is mainly domain knowledge

	On top of it if it comes to shadowmode usage, then it is crunching
	numbers using shadowmode for the customer, which will tell them
	whether to use a product or not, based on certain metrics.

	This is really "disconnected" from Data Analyst. Of course if this is
	the only thing I can get, then by all means take it.

	I have to do a backdoor project for Arnaud Hubaux (intrepreneuring),
	not all hope is lost, but time is wasted.

	**Consequence**: Moving to V-town and restarting food life again, finding
	a house and wasting time etc... 

3. Internship at dealroom or finding other internships

	**Consequence**: money for 6 months but after that job?

4. Applying through Recruitment Agencies

5. Possibility to do JNSCSR or other local masters for a year here or
   in UK?

6. Long term, do a 1 year masters in the US



Things to consider, moving to v-town and associated overhead, rehab is
it's own thing so don't bother about it right now.

Created a project on GCP and a billing ting on GCP.

**Notes from the meeting**:

- Web analytics company

	- work at the gap between MarTech and IT e.g., 
		- Writing Google cloud functions to detect Failure in
          "pixels", and other codes added by others. Once detected do
          an action, like send an email for example.
		- Same for different clouds, different triggers, 		
		
	- Other things I could be doing
	
		- Devops (Build services, test, release, Monitor, plan)
		- backend of website
		- Setting up the Scaling, and Load balancing on cloud for companies		

- Prediction 

	- Freo Rabobank has a model to predict customer conversion 
	- improve and identify which customer segment to focus on based on
      conversion rates, Credit score etc...
	- Make it a "product".
	
	- For Macieb? Using Evolutionary NN to adapt to new changes in the
      data and serve on the cloud
	
- end to end work

	- Get young capital data in CRAM format --> perform analysis on
      who is most likely to be hired
	- Also get&translate eventdriven data into insights  
	- Set up the service or product on cloud


- Write to wout saying this is your understand and this is what you

### Mail not accepting the offer

Hi Harm, Wout and Suze,

Unfortunately I am unable to accept the offer at this time.

I had a discussion with my family and have come to the conclusion that it might not be the best decision to switch companies at this time.

Owing to an old injury, I was recently informed that I have to undergo some rehabilitation treatment from Jan to March-end (current planning with possibility of postponement). It will take up a lot of time (2-3 days) during the weekdays and I don't think it would be the best for me to power through it.

I think it will be better for me to switch jobs with a bit more ease of mind. I hope to get in touch with you after my treatment, to see if an opportunity still exists.

I really appreciate the interviews and the time you have spent with me to help me understand about the company and the role. I thank you for your offer and hope to work with you in the future.

Thank You.

Regards,
Thej

## email to wout

Hi Wout,

From our discussion on Friday, I gather the following regarding the type
of work I will be doing at Relevant Online. I might be wrong in some
cases, please feel free to correct it:

1. Work at the intersection of MarTech and IT e.g., writing Google
   cloud functions to be triggered on events such as failure pixels. And
   subsequently these cloud functions reporting via email etc.
   
2. Setting up Cloud platforms for clients e.g., such as and
   notwithstanding setting up scaling, load balancing, type of
   buckets, and servers (and maintaining them) etc.
   
3. Improving Prediction models of other companies, e.g., for Freo you
   are "enhancing" the prediction model to predicts "client score" or
   the "type of people who reliably pay loans". 
   
4. Delivering models from scratch, e.g., delivering Evolutionary NN
   models so that models adapt to new data.
   
5. End to End Data Analytics, e.g., For Young Capital you built
   database from eventdriven data architecture (PUB/SUB) and combined
   it with YC data stored in CRAM format. You made analysis on who is
   more likely to be hired based on that. This way you started at the
   beginning at data collection, made a model and professionalized it
   on a cloud platform.


Things I would like to gain experience in are: 

1. Going from data --> insights --> actions (or improving decision making)

2. Answering questions using data

3. Building models

4. Using Dashboarding, cloud platforms, Python, SQL as tools in
   realizing the above.

5. Translating Client's business needs into solutions

Overall, I think there is a good match. Let me know what you think.

entire data science cycle including ETL, modelling, maintaining and
dashboarding. I think this job is ideal for me as it lists several of
the skills I have experience in, such as software development, machine
learning, clustering, deep learning, GIT, Agile way of work,
dashboarding, working with HTML/CSS, OOP with Python etc. Coming from
a big company such as ASML, I understand that there is so much
untapped potential to do people analytics through surveys, yearly
evaluations and other HR related documents. This allows us to
understand ways to improve productivity, satisfaction and overall well
being of people. Lastly, I am thrilled to apply my knowledge, learn
the best practices and create a lot of value at ING.

      (it was hard, not done before). Boss is putting pressure to wrap
      it up. But there is a lot of value if I succeed, make
      commitments with other teams, get info 6 months earlier  
      T: 1. learnt software, cross-checked with excel calculations
	  A: Push back or grind a bit more under pressure,focussed on most
	  important aspects, such as not testing every single time, but
	  establishing framework testing it and moving on, 
	  R: we claimed volume, we just did tests 6 months later and we

          (structure, performance, skills & competencies)
	-  Coming from a big company such as ASML, I understand that there
          is so much untapped potential to do people analytics through
          surveys, yearly evaluations and other HR related
          documents. This allows us to understand ways to improve
          productivity, satisfaction and overall well being of
          people.

### notes and questions

He is from uterect. One part  of the job is to do the technical
aspects but the other part is to manage stakeholders, convince people
about your idea. There is lot of freedom, you have to drive yourself.

What they work on needs to be salable otherwise there is no point of
it. so it they don't have access to actual data, then they should
anatomize. **He said I was spot on about that**.

I also told him randomly about survey design put my nose in those
aspects. **He thinks I can learn things, thats no issue** and that I
am driving myself well.
   
follow ups: next round 1.5 hr tech nical portfolio or code you built and created, ), Python sql, 

solve a case together, scoping it, finding your way through it.. team lead, team fit

feedback suggest, bring it to your journey? how to apply your
knowledge,

### indrew notes

**like and dislike** --> working cross-competence, training... , project,
connections, wanna do... social (activeities organized (chritsmas))

dislike --> higher levels **political**.. doesn't always feel free., once
a year promotion...

like --> opportunities that are given , different types of projects,
clients, challenge, new initiatives

dislike? Client is not as far as like you (certain tech) analytics
tool.. everything new for client, insurance --> simple regression
model (interpretability)

highpressure?

Noujka --> ams --> tennis

Sander --> computational mechanics, PWC, banking, data remidiation
projects, current risk modelling (P(defaults, exposure defaults))

**Structure**

PWC
- accounting firm, 
- advisory (split-up) --> consulting, deals (mergers), strategy,
  consulting (short projects)
- tax legal

consulting --> finance (banks insurance, pension funds), public sector
-->covt
- SIPS (Consumer industry product) --> commercial
--> Competences, analyitics, tech, leadership, risk,  (other way to
intuition)

--> Data Analyst --> associate, Senior associate (overall Data Analyst
skills, consulting skills), industry more important but beginning you
are free from having to make choices. Data Analyst team, across teams, Traininings, 

--> Team 55 people Data Analyst

**Work ex of indrewers**

--> Brief (logistics) in america dashboarding, business units  help
dash boards (not often that you are placed)

--> Heineikken --> financial sytem old to new 0--> clearning of data

	--> Built a tool, matching invoices (one invoice to )
	
	--> tools team 5 people, competences finance, 
	client access to data bases, VMs
	
--> Laptop from the client ()

current risk modelling (defaults client) --> loss ? tools? data model
from all systems togehter, MSE... clustering (self colleateral -->
building)

tools and skills? identifying fraud, thesis supervising,--> fraud
cases, 

AUC, business point of view... --> fraud detection --> 

False positive. 

False negative --> negative is not fraud (your predicting wrong)

xgboost,

why Machine Learning... 

conservative...

- 

- team player here... hard problems,

- PWC powerpoints

- pwc powerpoints -->  (cutting edge.. )

- fraud detection (evryday.. consulting firm.. external view) not
  cutting edge
  
- processing, smarter way..  information insights, predictive

- next steps (tuesday --> business case

- industry.. 

### questions asked

1. TMAY

2. What is False Positive and False negative from a business context?
   (I sucked at answering this)

3. What does the confusion matrix mean? for fraud detection

4. What sort of team player are you? I said I seek out my niche, 

5. follow up? What if there are two people like you? I am sure I can
   work together, 
   
6. What motivates you in a job?

7. Why are you leaving ASML?

	- It's not cutting edge and conservative with tech and lack of
      transferable skills
	  
	- Even in PWC we are not doing cutting edge stuff everyday
	
	- We have to use Powerpoint everyday what will you do then?
	
8. Have you any experience with interpretting data? 
   - I tried saying I had to do it in some context with fraud
     detection with giving an example about time and date.
	 
9. What industry preference ? commerical --> finance --> Govt. but
   open to others.
   
10. What do you do in PL? I said, look at road map made by someone
    else, Keep track of milstones, answer to higher up, and adjust
    planning, nad escalate if we need more people, but also consider
    users that are working now and get their feedback and improve
    things based on users prio.
	
	They were like it seems reactive, Why? I said yes it seems so, as
    perhaps the user also fucked up. We work agile, we make a product
    and give it to customer and then they give feedback (also a way of
    work).


I feel like I want to clarify that I am not trying to act like I am
aiming for a higher position. I am happy to get a start and start at
the bottom and climb my way from there.

### job description

http://web.archive.org/web/20211017191102/https://banen.bol.com/vacature/data-analyst-optimal-checkout-experience/

**how do you make** our customers happy?  Together with some **47,000
partners**, bol.com is changing retail to make the daily lives of 13
million customers easier. This results in an **enormous amount of
orders and customer-partner interactions**. Plus a diamond mine of
data. Think of **shopping behavior data**. But also data about the way
in which customers pay. What **patterns do we see in our checkout**?
What choices do customers make? And how do those insights help to
provide customers with more personal and more relevant checkout
options? As a Data Analyst Checkout Experience you provide insights
that 'feed' (experiments with) innovations. Concentrate for a seamless
customer journey with **happy customers and high conversion**.

**What you do**
as a Data Analyst Optimal Checkout Experience
- You identify new, **data-related opportunities** within a container of
  structured and unstructured data: Big Query is (or will be) your
  best friend
- You facilitate the team with **data insights** (analysis, **reports**,
  **dashboards**)
- You **present insights powerfully and understandably**, so that the
  team is inspired to get started and make the right choices
- You stimulate **hypothesis-driven work** and data-driven prioritization
  among colleagues
- You **influence the product roadmap** based on your insights: where can
  we go, why do we want that, and in which phases?
- You are our in-house guru when it comes to (daily) data analytics
  questions
- You prioritize opportunities for improvement that you – together
  with Business Analysts, Data Scientists and Engineers – translate
  into concrete and manageable actions, epics and stories

Bol.com is big. The number of data opportunities is enormous. We are
literally an oversized candy store for data-hungry professionals. 😉
But 'a lot of data' not only brings opportunities, but also
challenges, because not all insights are created equal. It is
therefore important to gain relevant insights and to share them with
data users in a meaningful and understandable way. Translated to the
Checkout domain, this means that you zoom in on questions such as 'how
do you combine order data with customer behavior at the shopping cart
stage? and 'how do we increase the relevance of our delivery and
payment options during the checkout process?' The role requires
data-analytical skills (if you use Excel as be all, end alltool, you
will be disappointed with us), plus the talent for convincingly
presenting complex insights and communicating in a manageable
way. Insights are valuable. Actions more valuable. You help your 10
colleagues in 1001 ways to make data-driven choices, so that they do
not innovate based on gut feelings, but work on projects that
demonstrably add customer value.

**Why you can make a difference**  
Because you are a hungry data tiger. Someone who looks at the world
with an analytical eye and spots patterns where others suspect white
noise. You can quickly identify and understand stumbling blocks and
opportunities. And gets energy from that. You like a fluid working
environment and like to interact with changing stakeholders. You also
enjoy formulating hypotheses and proving or disproving them
iteratively. To maximize your impact, it is important that you think
and work **independently**. You **experience and claim ownership and you
dare to influence the roadmap** based on your analyzes and insights,
even if that means that you have to challenge colleagues at some
point.

**What you are**  
- Well, if you work at HBO/WO level and have experience with test &
  learn environments
- Well, if you like to work in a team, show ambition and take the lead
  based on your knowledge
- Well, if you consider analytical tools like Tableau, Big Query and
  PowerPoint as your second home: if you can't run a query in it, it's
  not a tool ;-)
  
**What you are not**  
- Not, if you have a 'ask you, we run' attitude #own-initiative-is-grossly-overrated
- Not, if you consider customer behavior and feedback as side effects
- Not if you find it difficult to deal with continuously shifting priorities

- product categories
- average order size and value segments
- guest vs account
- how user comes to product selection
- by payment method


**What happened in the anamoly**

- hypothesis (stops at address)
	- unable to modify address
	- are there any errors?
	- did something change in the webpage
- stops after complete order
	- plot by payment type/method
	- see if you have other information from the affiliates
	- was it a particular time
	- Did our site crash? or did partner site crash?
		- check if it is the same for all payment methods
- You stop at delivery of products
	- larger shipping times than the rest of products (>1 week)
	- Lack of options for delivery
		- partner or bol.com delivery?
	- errors crashes
		- did something change in the webpage?
		- plot the type of errors?
	- reviews recent check


**Other hypothesis**

- numerator and denominator  (wrong), massive influx promo

- markets, user demographic, categories (basket composition), is it
  for a particular set of prime or select 
  
- other features, protection plan subscription

- new features,  

- data issue (check data), pull 2 tables 





### **Additional step to accept texts about an order**

**What is the effectiveness of this feature**

**Metric**: 

1. **Manage negative effects** % of people who completed payment w.r.t
people at checkout,

2. **Do people even want it** number of people who actually click yes
vs number of users who don't,

3. Checkout to thank you page should be same as checkout to text page
   (barring issues with payment) for the test group

4. total errors due to the feature and the control

**Random sampling and assignment of users based on recent months**

**Power of test**

figure out margin of error with business context and then calculate n

for margin of error calculate

**Running tests**

Run initially with 10% of the users and see how the ting is working,
look mainly for errors.

**When to accept it or keep it?**

90% --> keep it

50% 50% --> also keep it 

10% also keep it, perhaps in a less intrusive way.

Why laugh it in the first place

**feedback**

pause --> think of them as peers

spend time on understanding feature, where? spend time 


### **1 click checkout on item page, is an effective strategy**

**Metric**

1. adoption rate across price segments,  number of people who click it of all order conversions

2. conversion rate, avg revenue per user, error rates

**Pros**

Easier for people who shop

**cons**

can make many false orders and cancellations, see if this stabilizes
over time?
might take up real estate


### **Understanding pricing for partners**

**Plan**: pricing that varies with seller sale rate

**Evaluate strategy**

**Plan**: pricing increase by 5%

**Evaluate strategy**

#### Introduction

Vinted is a second hand marketplace where sellers upload items and try
to sell them to buyers.  It is normal that supply is larger than
demand, and not all items are being sold. However, our aim is to make
sellers happy. In order to provide sellers with as many opportunities
to sell as possible, they can buy specific features to promote their
items. One of the available promotion features is the “push up”
feature that boosts item visibility.

“Push ups” increase the attention given to a specific item on the
platform by increasing the visibility for potential buyers (i.e. more
views on the homepage and category page) for 3 days after having
purchased the “push up” feature. As a result, the item that is up for
sale will get significantly more views (on average). Currently, it
costs €2 to buy the “push up” feature. Vinted is considering whether
this is the best monetization strategy for the value added services.

Your task is to come up with a data-driven approach to evaluate the
existing “push up” monetization strategy and give suggestions on how
we could improve the monetization of the platform and its long-term
effects.


#### Data description

```
Column Type Description
```
```
category_2 string
```
```
High level category available on the platform in which users can
list an item
```
```
category_3 string
```
```
Low level category available on the platform in which users can
list an item
number_of_listings integer The number of listed items per category
avg_listing_price_eur numeric The average price listers ask for their listed items (EUR)
revenue_from_push_ups numeric Revenue made by Vinted from the “push up” feature price
```
#### Section I: Evaluate current situation (~45 min)

The people at Vinted often introduce new features to the platform. An
important step in deciding whether to continue a certain feature is to
evaluate the relevant metric(s).

```
(A)Explain with at least one graph how well the current “push up” feature is performing.
```
```
(B)In the GIRLS_CLOTHING / FOR_BABIES category, the price of the push up feature is
more than half of the average listing price. However, there are still sellers willing to pay
for the feature. Why do you think is this the case?
```
#### Section II: Analyse alternative strategies (~1.5 hour)

Besides the “push up” feature in its current form, one could think of
alternative ways to monetize this feature.

```
(A)Your colleague suggests keeping a fixed price for the “push up” feature throughout the
platform. What are the pros and cons of this strategy?
```
```
(B)Can you think of an alternative way to set the pricing of “push ups”? What are the pros
and cons for this strategy?
```
```
(C)Please evaluate the expected revenue of the strategy proposed in the previous question.
What is the improvement over the current strategy? Are there any risks involved with this
strategy?
```
#### Section III: Next steps (~30 min)

Suppose you and your team decide to pursue the new pricing feature you
suggested in this assignment. Describe the next steps in testing your
suggested pricing strategy in detail, up until the phase where it is
fully live on the Vinted platform.

_This is the end of the assignment_




### Case study feedback from mals

**Q1**

- "adoption" and willingness are key metrics to focus on.

- across category.

- primary and secondary kpi and scatterplot

- scatterplot overindexing and underindexing categories (this will be
  key to inform where you can work on and where you dont need to)

	- I don't see the point of best fit line. However scatter plot is
      great
	  
**Q1b**:  push up conversion rate is high?  

- Hypothesis 1: pushup features are bought at higher list price than
  the avg. list price.

- Hypothesis 2: people still find the feature useful despite the price
  parity
  
  
**Q2**

Think of varying price system based on adoption rate per category. 

This way you can perhaps increase the price in the categories that are
doing well.

Can we discuss this again?


**Plan**: increase price of pushup as a function of list price 

**Plan**: increase price of pushup as a function of the current
adoption rate per category. Higher the adoption rate, more the price?

avg/mdian item price per category

adoption rate per category   avg price per listing | push up price


 ratio: pushup price per avg list price
 
 
 pushup ratio --> x
 
 y --> adoption rate
 
**price elasticity**, how demand will 

conversion rate might not change, adoption change...



asoption rate sellers opting to y

conversion rate 

loose sellers in terms of pricing

adoption rate leaving --> 5% on avg list


---

--> avglisting price/2 and adoption
--> varying pushup price

x axi

--> how the adoption might 30% 


## Failed indrew questions


**pwc**

1. What do you want to do ? Don't say cutting edge and machine
   learning
   
   Analytics is the right answer, answering vague questions, going
   from insights to actions is also good,

2. Explain false negatives and false positives in a business context

3. I like to carve my niche, what happens if you can't?

**Vinted**

1. We are making a new feature --> verified seller batch, how do you
   measure the success of it (sell through rate), can it have a
   negative impact?
   
2. Say you want to measure this verify this, how will you do it?

3. When you split it will you randomize them by their people or the
   listings
   
   is there any bias, there shouldn't be both should be ok. control
   and other
   
**Gorillas**

1. How will you go about predicting what the next product suggestion
   should be? (my answer: Variables (history, history category,
   frequency, similar (price range, products)), (his answer:
   categories might not be a good idea or there are other ideas, as
   people usually go behind one type of beer and suggesting them other
   beers is useless). 
   
2. What if for everyone banana is suggested? (it could be the last
   option), (his answer: bananas everyone probably buy it, so no use)

### PWC

1. Often answer contradicting 

	e.g., Cutting edge is why I am leaving ASML and then flipped it to
    meet their answer when they said they rarely do cutting edge
    everyday
2. Explanation of Fals Negative and False Positive was basic in a
   business context
   
   Basic question
   
3. Too many years experience but no leading so far. Apparently he knows
   people who lead or are independent from day one. they want to treat
   me like senior associate. :(
   
   I should have probably stressed on how I did independent tasks
   
	
4. What can you do from now?

	1. don't try big 4
	2. try smaller consulting firms
	3. work in ASML, proactive, lead tools, show that lead you can
       lead, after 3 years I rarely do coding, I know what is needed
       and just lead

5. I told him I am ready to start from the bottom (but apprently that
   wont work for them, they tried)
   
6. Undersell your Data Science experience, currently you have 0
   business experience
   
7. Kaggle is not Data Science experience

**discussion on preparation for vinted indrew**

AB test Sell through rate, checkout rate, 


where is the error, 

e-commerce --> funnel --> visiting --> buying


product page, added to cart, finished a cart,



how to make a purchase. 



order --> item


min. criteria to get tick mark... 

100 sellers random assignment random samplig -->  cnot part of other
test, impact on other tests....


orthoganal... influence , leakage of other treatments

AB test, power of test, how long the test should be run,


6 months, statistical power

how many 


power of statistical power... sze of test and 

how can you randomize orders, show tick on certain products sold by
seler...



Prep inporting, pandas, matplotlib (bar )

-design of experiencemts 

population -> how many people you need, random assignment random
selection, metric, goals of the experiment, 

e-commerce --> item page --> highlights of product

x people show module --> 9%

y contole not module --> 8%

CI doesn't matter in difference --> +ve lift or -ve lift or no effect?

what will you do?

other metrics? conversion

if it nots 

Metrics --> 


S

metric "add to cart"

should you recoemmentd


when to launch it, 

- 
###

- sales is going down (per month, per week, how much by), typically
  happenign month to month rando, out of the ordinary... 
  
noise?  

why?

Hyothesis?

competitors, seasonailty, product release,

seller problem, buyer problem or product problem, data problem, things
are broken, 


garnularity--> country, category...




Metric... --> sell through rate 


groups of sellers, before after ... --> per post.... idfference in
diferrence


average and avergae increase... 



sell through rate --> Attention (visits), coming (visit to site),
seeing (view product), aadding to cart (), completing the transaction
()

last week 5%, 3%, where is it low... --> check granularity, country
wide, product wise, price wise, catoegory wise, 


plot a graph... time, 

Hypothsies --> country, randomness, add to cart, checkout, sellers are
not able to apply item, 


Market place --> sellers and buyers, seller or buyer or both, 


seller angle (fraud), scammers, how will  you investigate that



Sales is going down, scammers,

Skews on site, people call customer care.

### summary of convo!

**AB testing setup**

1. Question: Does feature X work (blue tick mark).

2. Revise question: Will Sell through rate (number of sales) increase if feature X is
   added to the app and shown to people?
   
3. Population: All the people in the world using the app.  

4. AB testing: Of all the listings or people, make 2 groups, i.e.,
   Randomly sampling? how what about new and old users? 
   What about random listing? how will you make it happen?
   Random Assignment? how discuss
   
5. Make sure the buyers you Target are not part of another RCT you
   are doing.

6. What is the statistical power? how many buyers do you need to get
   statistically significant tests, over how many months.

7. why listings over people? faster results? with listing perhaps the
   same user gets to see with verified and without verified tick.
   
8. Which to work with? CI1 vs CI2 is there an overlap?
   how will you get a CI? (think about it).
   
9. Other metrics to see incase you don't see any effect: Conversion,
   "add to cart", etc... to know if you should still recommend.
   
10. You can compare seller rate for the two groups or also increase in
    seller rates (difference in difference), when to use what?

**Thought experiement with Mallu**

So partner says, "Sales are going down". What to do?

**Is it really a problem**

check for randomness (anamolies), **plot** the fucking data

- could it be due to just time increase and seasonal peaks

**Which part of the funnel**

If you see some random peak or drop then you get into it. Where is it
coming from?

- Punnel --> Attention (visit to site), Seeing (viewing product),
  Adding to cart (), Completing the transaction (Conversation), post
  transaction (getting products)
  
- plot ratio 

- denominator or numerator or both

**Why that part of funnel**

- actual Hypothesis generation... If add to cart rate is coming down, 

- Granularity (Countries, product types, products)

- errors? Crashing? people don't want the product? policy change?
  can't find button? UX changes.

**Scam**

- Customers are complaining and not receiving the products?

- one off, or systematic issue (seasonal, month, week)

- Delivery rate (place the order/gettin order), 

**What happened?**

- Between someone placing the order and getting the order

- Granularity --> market level, category (TV, electronics), spending
  customers, 
  
- softness (delivery rate)

- Hypothesis (what can happen between those two)

	- packing company (carrier delay, category)
		- **Write problem first and then because to formulate the
          hypothesis**
		- Delivery rate is coming down (problem) because Carriers
          (UPS) is loosing packaging.
		- Plot delivery rate vs time for granularity to see if this
          could be the issue.
	- scam (Sellers are not sending)
		- Frame the hypothesis: DR is coming down because sellers are
          not sending packages.
			- existing and new sellers
			- order volume (high volume sellers, low volume sellers)
			- Sellers with some order volume
			- Proportion of 
			- increase in number of people who have poorer delivery
              rates. (Snapshots)
		- lower delivery rate people has increased
			- look at snapshots, 
			- look at range of delivery rate bucket --> their volume
              over time
			  
	- data issue?
	- data doesn't capture that sellers are unable to fulfil order and
      cancel from their side (so this is not really scam)
	- difference of diff vs regular comparision
	
- 3 4 problems in market place

	- Recommendation module
	- AB test this
		- 
		
	- Suddenly your seller rating completion rate reduced by 50%
	- Our sales data, how does a company doing well in area
		- revenue, profit, number of sellers , number of buyers
		- 
	- how do I know new market is doing well
	- 5
	
	
			  
	- this could not be the only hypotheiss, could be all!
		
	- buyers fraud
	- website error 
	- Cancel the order
	- policy (zipcode law changed, Signature on delivery)

### Recommendation Module feature AB testing

**Question**: Does adding our current recommendation module work?

**Metric**

For this I want to think about the punnel

Starting with Visiting pager --> Clicking product --> clicking add to
product --> Checkout page --> converstion --> delivery --> returns so
on

Lets start with going looking at **Clicks on product vs all
recommendations shown**, **Add to cart of product vs all
recommendations**. But in this case where feature doesn't exist for
the control group, I think I should look at total number of orders in
the end or the average number of products per customer.

Also track number of clicks on the add to cart button.

Effectiveness, click through rate, add to cart, checkout

**Revised question**

Does showing our recommendation module increase chances of a customer
buying more or clicking more?

**Doe**

1. Test group: Shown recommendations

2. control group: not shown recommendations

3. Population can be all users or also all listings or ?

	If it is a listing same users might be shown listings with and
    without recommendations.

**Population**: All users of amazon, let's say. or all listings

**Random Sampling and Assignment**

**Actual Programming**

From all users select n random people, and n/2 are randomly assigned
and "tracked" for the coming X months. 

**Track:** So we should average, median, percentile etc., number of
products per customer.

How to cover new users and people who don't have account?

Should I think about recent users or old users?

- is there a reco engie from before... 

**Identify number of people needed (power of test)**

My way --> figure out what would be a good +-CI value, use sd anf
Z__95 to calculate the number of users needed.


try ramping it up... slowly so that you don't create bad experiences.

errors or crashes is focus.

**Recommendation**

neutral, no harm, still taking real-estate, 


**Considerations**

Sample data, how long you go back depends on sample size sample size.

not in other experiements

### Seller rating completion rate reduced by 50%


**Is it really a problem**

Plot SRCR over time and see if it is due to seasonal peaks or
randomness.

If there is an anomoly, then...

**Where is anamoly from**

Check granularity --> Market level, Category type (furniture),
Seller spending segments, user-rating-type (email, next time you open
app)

**What happened in the anamoly**

Competition rate is defined by 2 tings 

1. numerator (number of ratings completed)

2. denominator (number of emails sent to request ratings + other things)

or both?

but in this case you are interested in the ratio.


- Hypothesis: SRCR is dropped suddenly because
	
	- a particular type of user-rating-giver (from email or other,
      because of product) pulling the average down
	  - people don't get the requests in the first place
		  - technical issue on the website (or software dev team)	  
	  - button not working

	- Certain product/categories which usually gets lower rate of
      SRCR, increases

### New market is doing well?

How to know if a market is doing well or if we need to intervene..

Revenue, profit, number of sellers and number of buyers

Then look into granularity (per category, per
user-segment-based-on-money)

**Is it really a problem**

Plot revenue, profit, number of sellers and buyers and funnel over
time.
  - detect anomalies
  - compare to baseline from other similar countries based on
    population and GDP?
  - plot subover categories, cost range of segments
  
Customer sentiment analysis in reviews about the product?

- Try to identify source of the problem (overall, categories, check
  user segments, check type of users segments)

- average initial growth in other "similar" countries vs this country?

- Revenue, how much should it grow by (baseline), 

**why?** something sucks


**within Revenue**

average order value, average order size, always look at both, proxy: 

reasons: economic level


**Plots**

1. Trend over time

2. Histogram

3. stacked bar chart over time (q1, q2,q3,q4) percentage of sales

4. % of sales per continent over time. put number inside...

- familiarize with their website
