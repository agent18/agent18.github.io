His List: the good life, antibodies

Getting it off the chest: Last time when we discussed, I got quite hurt. I would request you to try to see it from my side. It might me dead obvious to you. But I am slow. I understand I fucked up in the past, but how long are you going to keep kuthi kaating it to me.

emacs for non-programmers
unix for poets idea for plane text!

case studies! what they are doing, how they got into this

antibody: smoking using confomrity to ridicule smoking, gmaming, cell phones

adding a ridicule to what is a praise worthy action.

Whtast wrong with that... to understand what loosing idea of what a good life is...


Persuation!
