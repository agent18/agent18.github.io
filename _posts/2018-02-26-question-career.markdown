## The plan ahead

I want to spend a few more days doing some research into particular
choices of work, and answering other questions that would help in
making the final ABZ choices for my career. With this "essay" I
attempt to explore the questions needed to be answered.

## Career

Based on [80k hrs][80khours]'s research it is clear that there are
many problems that need people. Right now I don't know which is the
best problem to work on and in what capacity I should work on. Plus I
most probably don't have the skills. As per the suggestions of [80k
hrs][80khours], we should look to gain flexible career capital and be
good at what we do.

**What is career capital?** [what are the best ways to gain it?][80k-cc]

**What is flexible career capital?** what does it mean to have flexible
career capital? Some concrete examples of people having flexible
career capital please.

**What are some examples of things I see myself doing in 10-15
years?** Give example career profiles on linkedin, on 80k hours of
what you want to become and what you could become.

But to me roughly, I want flexible career capital allowing me to either
do direct work in the future, or  contribute modest earnings to
NGO's. With that I mean I should be capable of jumping to something
bigger and better when the time arises.

A few ways I think I might actually contribute to society in the
long run (based on guesstimated personal fit):

1.  Earn to give in data science / Management consulting / programming

2.  Working as a researcher at GiveWell, looking at data and
    determining which place needs funding and how effective they are.

3.  Having the ability to found companies that can cause much bigger
    impact

4.  Manage a business or start something that can make millions or is
    useful to a large number of people
	
5. or develop capability to have a career like this:

David Goldberg started the 'Founder's forum for good'.

> Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance (from a philosophy degree) in the US, started
> and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
> in California. - David Goldberg

P.S

The first hour was horrible, 2 and 3 rd hour become better, but not
like yesterday. In total 2.5 hrs. I was working on something that I had written earlier,
possibly that's the reason. After first 45 mins took about 40 mins break
