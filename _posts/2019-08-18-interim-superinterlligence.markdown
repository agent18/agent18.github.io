## Mission #9. 

**Mail dated Aug 13,**

Great job on spending 29 hours in a week! *I recommend measuring rate
of phrases per hour.*

Overall, I didn't see you take on Superintelligence, which was the
mission. Please work on either that or stuff you feel *confused*
about. *Only failures matter* (apart from maintenance of existing
performance).

Note down patterns of failure, such as "X prefers A to B". Spend, say,
half your time searching for and practicing on examples of those
types. You can spend the rest of your practice time on new examples,
from which you will hopefully find other patterns of failure.

**Mail dated June 24,**

Mission #9: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
concretely analyze the key claims in the book Superintelligence by
Nick Bostrom (the book mentioned in the Elon Musk tweet above). He's a
PhD at Oxford who's been writing about AI safety along with guys like
Eliezer for nearly two decades. The book has detailed arguments and
examples about all the topics like possible paths to
"superintelligence" (whatever that means), types of
"superintelligence", the control problem, etc.

No need to write "Question: " - doesn't seem to have changed your
answers.

Don't have to go sentence by sentence; *look at one key claim for each
section, usually the one in the first few paragraphs*, or one for each
paragraph if you feel it's an important section. For example:

> CHAPTER 2 Paths to superintelligence
>
> Machines are currently far inferior to humans in general
> intelligence. Yet one day (we have suggested) they will be
> superintelligent. How do we get from here to there? This chapter
> explores several conceivable technological paths. We look at
> artificial intelligence, whole brain emulation, biological
> cognition, and human-machine interfaces, as well as networks and
> organizations. We evaluate their different degrees of plausibility
> as pathways to superintelligence. The existence of multiple paths
> increases the probability that the destination can be reached via at
> least one of them.

The key claim is "How do we get from here to there? Answer: Artificial
intelligence, whole brain emulation, ..."

Feedback checklist:

1. Could it be that this claim has no any example at all? For example,
   "civilization is at stake".

2. Could this claim be false? Remember the "there is no doubting"
   example.

3. Does this claim say anything about "best" (need to compare against
   the entire set) or "most" (need to show it's the majority in the
   set) or "no" (need to show that nothing in the set matches)?

4. Did you stick to examples that are in the chapter itself? That way
   you don't have to search online for too long.

5. Did you use a running example for a technical phrase? There will be
   lots of new phrases in the book, like "convergent instrumental
   value" and "orthogonality thesis". Whenever you see them, you
   should recall whatever running example you've used.

6. If this is an "if-then" claim, did you either get a concrete
   example or mark it as having no example?

Short names: none; false; best; chapter; running; if-then.

Please refer to the checklist after every claim analysis to ensure
you're not making old mistakes. If you want to add to the checklist
based on mistakes found in past feedback, that's great.


## Chapter 2 Paths to Superintelligence (26).
### Artificial intelligence (8)

> How do we get from here to there? AI is a conceivable technology
> path.

**Claims**: AI is a conceivable technology path to go from current to superintelligent.

**Subject**: AI

**Predicate**: is a conceivable technology path to go from current to superintelligent.

**Example**: ~~"blind evolutionary processes can produce human-level
general intelligence, since they have already done so at least
once. Evolutionary processes with foresight—that is, genetic programs
designed and guided by an intelligent human programmer—should be able
to achieve a similar outcome with far greater efficiency."~~

*These are reasons, more claims. This claim is about the future*

**Definition**: Also, what does conceivable even mean? How
would I know if it is conceivable. How would I know the definition?

**Checklist**: no; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
"future with no ex"; "definition unclear"

> (Evolutionary processes with foresight—that is, genetic programs)[1]
> designed and guided by (an intelligent human programmer)[2]—should be
> able to achieve a (similar outcome with far greater efficiency)[3].

**Claims**: [1] designed and guided by [2] should be able to achieve
[3].

**Subject**: [1] designed and guided by [2].

**Predicate**: should be able to achieve [3].

**Example**: ~~"If we were to simulate 10^25 neurons over a billion
years of evolution (longer than the existence of nervous systems as we
know them), and we allow our computers to run for one year, these
figures would give us a requirement in the range of 10^31–10^44
FLOPS. For comparison, China’s Tianhe-2, the world’s most powerful
supercomputer as of September 2013, provides only 3.39×10 16 FLOPS. In
recent decades, it has taken approximately 6.7 years for commodity
computers to increase in power by one order of magnitude. Even a
century of continued Moore’s law would not be enough to close this
gap"~~
 
*"Should" is hard to get an example for*, *This again talks about
some prediction for the future*

*If we assume the calculations scratched out above as evidence, then we
see the evolution is not possible within this century. But any
calculation is not an example, just like we don't consider [Elizebeth
Warren's statement](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/06/17/elizabeth-warren-student-loan-debt-forgiveness/#60261e105e7b) of voiding all student debt and countering for
it via increasing taxes for the ultra millionaires*. 

*It's never been done before. Moving on.*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
"should"; "future with no ex";

> Another way of arguing for the (feasibility of artificial
> intelligence)[1] is by pointing to the (human brain )[2] and
> suggesting that we could use it as (a template for a machine
> intelligence)[3].

**Claims**: [1] can be done by using [2] as [3].

**Subject**: [1] using [2] as [3].

**Predicate**: can be done.

**Example**: ~~whole brain simulation, taking inspiration from brain,
neuromorphic approaches, recursive self-improvement~~

*There is no example for being superintelligent or even close to
superintelligent, let alone with whole brain emulation or taking
inspiration from the functioning of the brain*

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; neither; none; not-chapter; not-running; none;
"future with no ex"

### Brain-computer interfaces (4)

**Claims**: We get from current to superintelligent by using
Brain-computer interfaces.

**Subject**: That which will lead us from current to superintelligent

**Predicate**: brain-computer interfaces

**Example**: ~~"Impressive work on the rat hippocampus has dem-
onstrated the feasibility of a neural prosthesis that can enhance performance in a
simple working-memory task."~~

~~"This prosthesis can not only restore function when the normal
neural connection between the two neural areas is blockaded, but by
sending an especially clear token of a particular memory pattern to
the second area it can enhance the performance on the memory task
beyond what the rat is normally capable of."~~

*Future*.

**Definition**: -

**Checklist**: no; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none; "future with no ex"  


### Conclusion

There are many possible paths thought of by the community. But all of
them seem to be predictions. The author is claiming that the gap to
Superintelligence can be fixed if we do XYZ. For example, they claim
cyborgization of man will lead to Superintelligence. Yet, the examples
we see are the ones where patients are able to communicate by moving a
cursor on a screen. Another example, was the rat whose performance was
"enhanced" in a simple working-memory task. What I fail to see is an
example showing glimmers of Superintelligence, i.e., something that
can do **many things** at **much higher performance** than current
humans/rats/whatever.

Yes computers can beat the shit out of humans in games. Great. But we
do not seem to consider this as SI. The whole of the
2nd chapter is all claims without examples. Agree or disagree? why?
Everyone "could do" everything in theory, but when testing a claim, we
want examples. This is very similar to people claiming "human
civilization is at risk due to AI". Where are my examples? what am I
missing? or am I on the right track? In other words, I am unsure if
the example matches the definition. Also what does "conceivable path
to SI" even mean? 

Can you show me a claim from the second chapter and how it is meets
the definition? or how one of the suggested methods is conceivable?

Thanks.
