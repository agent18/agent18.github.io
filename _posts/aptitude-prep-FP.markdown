I could do this test again, I have so many questions.

With aptitude I think I want to target those questions where I failed.

Let's do all picnic questions. See where all I failed? and then work
on them?

That might be just enough.

Let's start?

## Inductive is shapes and BS

## Deductive

q5 deductive

q6 deductive

q8 deductive


## APM-3 test from Founder's Pledge

23 mins and 40 mins. This is for part 1. APM-3 is test name and it is
called Advanced Progressive Matrices.

Of the 4 practice questions the last one with mixing and matching rows
and columns was hard.

Idea atleast is like this. But the actual test seems much harder.

What you are expected to do?

Look at row and look at column.


## My guess

I did "pretty bad"

Out of the 23 questions, I think I might have about 15. The last few
questions were so hard. And I just was probably saturated. I was
hearing music in my head. 

The part 2 which had only 2 mins --> I think I answered the first one
atleast right. Not sure. don't have the screenshots either. This test
is fucked up.
