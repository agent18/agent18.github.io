## Feedback list

**Feedback checklist:**

1. Could it have examples? remember: "civilization is at stake due to AI"
   (consider the possibility it has not examples)

2. True or false? Remember: "There is no doubting the
   force of the argument" (consider a falsifying example)

3. best most no comparison? Remember: "The best career capital is got by working
on the most important problems." (consider if you need to compare)

4. From chapter?  (consider examples from chapter)

5. Running? Remember: "Characteristics of DP explained with tiger
   woods alone" (consider if it is a running example)

6. If-then If Given? "Given that we want batsmen who are short and
have curly hair, here are the batsmen we found: Sachin Tendulkar"
(consider the given type statements)


**Checklist at the end of every example-claim sequence**: 

**Checklist**: yes; false; best; not-chapter; not-running; if  

## Failure scenarios

We don't care about beliefs!

**beliefs**

> **Claims**: Crime should not pay
>
> **Subject**: Crime
>
> **Predicate**:  Should not pay
>
> **Example**: 3000 people were killed by AL-Qaeda in the US (9-11).
>
> **Definition**: checks out I think!
>
> **Checklist**: not-sure; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none

> This is a predicate based on his beliefs about what is right and
> wrong, not on empirical examples. "Crime does not pay" is a predicate
> about the world and it would be false if the average crime led to a
> lot of money without imprisonment. "Crime **should** not pay" can be
> skipped for now. ("The Holy B says that crime should not pay" is
> testable, though.)

**X prefers A to B**

> Many prisoners prefer to do jobs, instead of having to sit in their
> cells all day
>
> Subject: What prisoners prefer
>
> Predicate: to do jobs instead of having to sit in their cells all
> day.
>
> Example: ~~The Firefighter prisoners in the video found working
> "rewarding".~~ I don't have any examples for this

Good job! If you failed here, you can note down this pattern "X
prefers A to B", so that you can focus on it in the future and stop
making that mistake. Just like you would focus on two-digit
multiplication if that's where you have failed in the past. For
example, "a certain Agent prefers not marrying to marrying or not
having kids to having kids".

"But I don't have any examples of the case where the aforementioned
Agent has kids!" -- Ask the people selling this to you for smaller
claims that you can test right now, such as "you will like holding a
baby" or "changing a diaper ain't all that bad" or "people don't get
too upset when their kids disobey them".

All am going to do is mark the example and export and take count using
some graphics tool like calc.
