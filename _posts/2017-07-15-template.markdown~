#### Conflicting views

Everytime I watch a PETA video or a video from allepo about the disastrous state the world is in, especially and most likely only ones where people are getting injured, such that the emotional quotient is high for me, I cry. I weep like a bitch. This is approximately 0.0000001% of my time in a day when I happen to, by chance come across a video with such characteristics. But everytime it happens, it bites me to bits, and lasts only for a few seconds after. After that, I am mostly just working, getting paid for that work. I come back home from work, wonder what I am doing in life, while I watch other people hanging out with women and friends, while I just go home and not be a part of such "Cool" activities. I feel sad :(.

On other days, there is gym, Man what a place to be. There is sports, Man this is life etc...

Another day, you watch some [not-so-random guy come on the tube][martin] and talk about [happiology][martin_ted], and says most  activities we do are pleasurable, only activities that give you meaning and activities that focus on your doing something bigger than you will get you lasting happiness. Things like say, being in the "service of GOD", or being in the servitude for people (BATMAN, Gandhi), or the like. You mull this over, maybe this is what you want to do and then what happens? Back to the fucking grind.

Another day, you see a video by [Peter singer][] and then weep your fucking balls off, shocked at the extent to which people are willing to go to save people they have no idea about and you share that video with friends. "And then?" you ask? Well, Back to the fucking grind.

So can we come to a consensus that it is really unclear **what I want to do**. But somehow I end up doing the same thing over and over again. I cry, don't take action, just sit around and wonder whats the use of all this?

Should I maybe do something about it?

Get to the bottom of it maybe

Well!

#### Feelings and Wants

We seem to have wants; Wants sucha as 'I want food', 'I want a girlfriend', 'I want a social life' etc. We want some wants more than the others, We choose one over the other based on _how we feel_ towards something. Based on the where we are, who we are around, time of day etc., we want some things more than others. Like for example, **NOW** I see there is a sick want to get girlfriends despite the fact that there are other things to do as there are so many millions of people suffering. But **if I am in a situation** where there is one person dying and I need to give up the only time I actually get laid in my life, well I guess I would. And **I am in such a situation now** where more than one person is dying, in millions of people are dying, and I am busy thinking looking at facebook and youtube, when I am actively supposed to be generating money and pumping it for 

We seeem to have 'wants'; 'Wants' such as food, girlfriends, social life, etc. We want some of these more than others, based upon the scenario we are part of at a particular moment. Based on the where we are, who we are around, time of day etc., we want some things more than others. Like for example, **NOW** I see there is a sick want to get girlfriends despite the fact that there are other things to do as there are so many millions of people suffering. But **if I am in a situation** where there is one person dying next to me and I need to give up the (only time I actually get laid in my life), well I guess I would. **And I am insuch a situation**, many millions of people are dying but I don't _feel_ within me anything that pushes me to help them. The only mistake of the people dying is that they are not dying next to me. I don't feel. If I don't feel, well I don't do?
