Need to further break down "number of 'good quality' people". Are we
talking about (a) the number of people in the world with a certain
level of qualification (say, PhD in Economics and 2 years of work
experience), whether or not they work in one of the EA organizations,
(b) the number of people who applied for a particular job posting, or
(c) the number of people who were hired?

(What is this "quality" you speak of?)

What they say and think about the number of candidates fit for the job
is different from the number of people hired or the other claims we
saw above. Stick to one claim at a time. See what happens when you
don't try to test the claim "holistically".

short on cash"? "affected by funding"? "ability to immediately deploy
available talent is weak"?

Unfortunately, my dictionary is defective and seems to have omitted
those words, so I'm having a hard time following this.

How are you supposed to test the claim that someone is "short on
cash"? He didn't hire a million people? Even Bill Gates didn't hire a
million people.

Contrast that to: this year's hiring budget. Even if that number is
not directly available, you could look at related numbers like last
year's expenditure on salaries and other overhead, last year's funds
raised, and thus whatever surplus amount they have for hiring this
year (this is one way people may decide their hiring budget; they may
also look at their projected funds raised this year, etc.). Example:
MIRI budget breakdown -
https://intelligence.org/2019/12/02/miris-2019-fundraiser/.

So, one way to look at claims of "funding-constrained" is to see the
growth in budget and check if there was a surplus compared to last
year and if more of that went into hiring new employees or if it went
into higher salaries for existing employees, administrative costs
(like managers or accountants), and higher rent for a bigger office.

Why does this matter? If someone's projected budget is not higher than
last year's, then he probably doesn't have much budget for hiring new
employees. In that case, I would predict that donating more would
probably lead to more hires and thus hopefully more impact (SST). But
if his projected budget is higher and he still doesn't allocate much
for new hires, then I wouldn't expect to see more donations to lead to
more hires and more I-word. Much of that money might go into higher
salaries or a bigger office (which may or may not lead to less I-word
but will probably be different from that for new hires).

This is answering a different kind of question from the question for
this section. This is about "does the age of the organization affect
how much they 'seem to want money'?" But the question for this section
was "are they 'short on cash'?" #SeparateThyClaims

Lovely. Keep up the great work, Mr. Agent. 3.6 hours per day calls for
a nice celebration (alcohol or whatever you prefer as a treat). Here's
to several thousand hours more.

*****

Mission #7: Here's your mission, should you choose to accept it - take
up some passage that has **confused** you (could be about work, politics,
EA, or AI), narrow down its claims, and test them with one concrete
example each. The **output dimensions** for each claim would be whether
you have a concrete example for the subject and the predicate and
whether the example actually talks about the same thing as the claim
(survey vs acceptance rate).

The twist is that you have to rewrite the sentence till the claims
without concrete examples are gone. For example, "we are short on
cash" will become "we have zero budget for new hires this year" plus
example.

## important take away and claim

So we have the **claim**: Meta-orgs don't seem to be "affected by
funding" while hiring researchers. Let's say I wanted to test this
against **EE** and not with "OPP didn't want to hire in that round
because of ...". Then, I see the problem. I can't test it bro. Hell I
don't even know what it means. I am lost.

Let's try another,

**Claims**: Meta-orgs don't want to hire more researchers ~~not
because of funding issues~~ despite having enough funding.

Even this is not good. SS is hurting like hell "don't want to hire more
researchers", "despite having enough funding". 

**Claims**: Meta-orgs do not allocate more funding than previous year
to hire more researchers (than last year), despite allocating "more"
funds to other things like bigger office etc...

This seems to be testable by checking budget as an STM has
informed. Ufff! that took time to get to.

**Lessons**: Make claims testable by removing the fluff ("affected by
funding"). Go back to square one, subject predicate level to identify
the fluff. Agent is struggling with complicated claims ("affected by
funding"). As soon as you change that complicated part, you can modify
the claim to make it testable (as shown above).

## Current essay on bottleneck

### EA orgs hiring

Research, Operations, Entrepreneurship 

1. 

**Claim**: EA orgs don't seem to be able to hire the number of
*Entrepreneurs* they set out to, at the end of a hiring round.

**Re-write claim**: The number of people who were accepted at the end
of the incubation round for Entrepreneurs, is greater than or equal to
the number of incubees budgeted for at the beginning of the year.

**Subject**: The Number of people who were "accepted" at the end of an
incubation round for entrepreneurs

**Predicate**: is greater than or equal to the number of incubees
budgeted for at the beginning of the year.

**Example-sub**: [17 people](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fNRSGinhWqPZtuo3T/application-process-for-the-2019-charity-entrepreneurship) accepted 

**Example-pred**: 10 people budgeted for "initially".

Note: It is hardly possible to see from the [budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pVLfqvE8cIQDcRKHN4L_YnFbOilLQG-dC5DtNWvLUxw/edit#gid=0) how many
people they budgeted for. But the CEO informs via mail that it was 10
"initially" for the year 2019.

> At the very start, we budgeted for 10 but moved it up to 12 after
> getting a better sense of applications eventually having in 13 in
> the program.

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; yes; ecm; Yes; s-1;

**General**: Budgets are hard to find (let alone read). CE's budget
was hidden in a blog post which I got a hold of only after reaching
out to them. :(

Hmm. I didn't really expect that based on what was said initially. In
the last essay I literally said that: " EA orgs *don't* seem to be
able to hire the number of *Entrepreneurs* they want, *at the end of a
hiring round*." But looking at the re-written claim this is not
true. The contrast is baffling. I thought they meant one thing but I
ended up with the opposite.

> Last year we were not management, mentoring or funding constraint
> and would have let in more people if we thought more people could
> found an extremely impactful charity.

"if we thought more people could found an extremely impactful charity"

Ah man. I hate English.

2. EA orgs don't seem to be able to hire the number of *Researchers*
they set out to, at the end of a hiring round.

**Claim**: EA Orgs are able to find the people they want while hiring Researchers

**re-write Claim**: The number of people who were hired at EA Orgs in
Research is equal or greater than their goal for that year.

**Subject**: The number of people who were hired at EA Orgs in
Research

**Predicate**: is equal or greater than their goal for that year.

**Example-sub**: In 2019 [7 joined their research team](https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/).

**Example-pred**: They wanted to have [3-5 signed offer letters](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity) from new
research staff as per their goals explicitly stated in their blog.

**Definition**: 7 \> 5

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**General**: Getting info from GiveWell's budget was hard.

---

3. Operations

**Claim**: Ea Orgs don't seem to be able to hire the number of 

**re-write Claim**: The number of people who were hired at EA orgs in
Operations is equal or greater than their goal for that year.

**Example-sub**: In 2019 [3 people joined the operations team](https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/). 

**Example-pred**: In 2019 GiveWell wanted [to hire 1 operations associate](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity).

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes;

### EA orgs types and hiring

4. 

**Claim**: *Longtermism* organizations are able to find the people they
are looking for.

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at Longtermism Orgs is
equal to or greater than their goal for that given period.

**Subject**: Number of people hired at Longtermism Orgs in a given period

**Predicate**: is equal or greater than their goal for that given period.

**Example-sub**: MIRI had 8 research staff in [Jan 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180113211347/https://intelligence.org/team/). MIRI has
[16 research staff as of Dec 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20191224082740/https://intelligence.org/team/). But, Marcello Herreshoff seems
to have left during that time and Nate Soares seems to have taken the
"leadership" role. `16-(8-2)=10`. So they did end up hiring 10 new
people.

**Example-pred**: [10 research people to be hired in 2 years](https://intelligence.org/2017/12/01/miris-2017-fundraiser/) (from 2017)

**Definition**: Checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**Disclaimer**:

According to MIRI, they were up by [8 research staff as of
2019](https://intelligence.org/2019/12/02/miris-2019-fundraiser/). It appears MIRI is looking at net population of staff. And
they also hired one person before 2019 ended for February 2020 and now
another joins in May 2020. *Making it 10* delayed over 6 months.


Thalaiva thank you for showing me. Inshallah inshallah! Too soon? It's
still hard matching the evidence with the claims.

And thalaiva should I go dvorak? emacs vandhachu.. Then I will also
invest time already. 

the amount of persuasion I feel to do better, to not suck, to realize
that I suck seems so important. When I do this work is where I get to
that level. Pandya! common bro... Persuasion is king. Persuasion is everything

Linkedin is no good to look at as some members are not accessible

budgets are not complete for 2019... what to do?

5. 

**Claim**: *Meta orgs* are able to hire the number of people they want

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at Meta Orgs is equal
to or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Subject**: The number of people hired at Meta Orgs in a given year.

**Predicate**: is equal to or greater than their goal for that given
year.

**Example-sub&pred**: 

Unable to find more info on forecasting or budgets from OPP. And from
their website it appears they didn't have a clear idea of how many
people they wanted as GRs. They keep stating ["several" Generalist
researchers](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities) in 2018. So we skip that.

OPP was looking for [one Director of Operations in 2018](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities). OPP hired
[Beth Jones from May 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-jones-4b16392b/) (whose applications closed in May).

OPP seems [to be looking for atleast 1 grants associates](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities). [Jan
2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180105182929/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team) shows 2 people with that function (Grants associate), Derek
Hoph got promoted and [by Nov 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181128184458/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team) Anya Grenier joins leading to
`2-(2-1)=1` hire as they had forecasted.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

No info [here](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities).

No where does it say they wanted only 5 or that they decided to hire
only 5. Budgets are no where to be found.

DEAD END

Open phil is not explicit about how many they want in [2018](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-job-opportunities) or [2019](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-progress-2018-and-plans-2019)

Need to check the claim and all that later.

3 claims and it takes 3 hours. :( Speed up pandya

6. 

**Claim**: *GH&P orgs* are able to hire the number of people they
budgeted for

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at GH&P Orgs is equal
to or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Subject**: The number of people hired at GH&P Orgs in that given year

**Predicate**: is equal or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Example-sub&pred**: GiveWell[ 2018 goals was to  hire 1 head of growth](https://blog.givewell.org/2018/04/20/givewells-outreach-and-operations-2017-review-and-2018-plans/) and
in June [Ben Bateman](https://www.givewell.org/about/progress/2018-review#Outreach) started.

<!-- Regarding researchers, they admit to not having clear picture about -->
<!-- how many they wanted to hire ([Research point 6: hire flexible -->
<!-- research capacity](https://www.givewell.org/about/progress/2018-review#Outreach)) in 2018. -->

In 2019, they wanted to have [3-5 signed offer letters](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/05/16/givewells-plans-for-2019/#ResearchCapacity) from new
research staff. And [7 joined their research team](https://blog.givewell.org/2020/05/20/reflecting-on-our-progress-in-2019/).

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; yes; pre; yes; ecm; yes;

I have checked in the past and GiveWell doens't really provide how
many they want to hire. But perhaps I can look at their budget and the
outcome as mentioned in teams in archive.org.

The trouble is not in finding the number of researchers added (with
archive.org), but it is in, forecasting.

7. 


**Claim**: *Animal EA orgs* are able to find the people they want

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at Animal EA Orgs is
equal to or greater than their goal for that given year.

**Subject**: The number of people hired at Animal EA Orgs

**Predicate**: is equal to or greater than their goal for that given
year.

**Example-sub**: 0 senior researcher by the end of the year 2019 since
Oct 2019 comparing web archive team's page of ACE.

**Example-pred**: [1 senior researcher by the end of the year 2019](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/room-for-more-funding-2019/)

**Definition**: Claim is false.

**Checklist**: sub; Yes; pre; Yes; ecm; Yes; 

**Problems**

Unable to extract proper forecasts:
https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/room-for-more-funding-2019/#fn2-1-26652

Is program officer hired or needed?

Whether they hired someone or not can be found easily either through
websrchive, or through their [budgets comparing last year and this
year](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/transparency/financials/). But the forecasts are hard to come by

There are no budgets available, even if they are they are not useful
as they don't have the forecasts which is what one would be interested
in.

8. 

**Claim**: The type of organizations (AI, GH&P and Meta) in EA doesn't
seem to affect whether the org can find a hire or not.

The type of organizations in EA does not change the statues if an org
is able to meet the forecasted number of hires by the end of the year.

**re-write Claim**: The number of people hired at different types (AI,
GH&P and Meta) of EA Orgs is equal to or greater than their hiring goal for
that given year.

**Subject**:  The number of people hired at different types (AI,
GH&P and Meta) of EA Orgs in a given year.

**Predicate**: is equal to or greater than their hiring goal for that
given year.

**Example sub&pred**: As we have seen above, AI org MIRI predicted a 10 people
hire in 2 years and seemed to have exactly accomplished that. 

Meta Org OPP wanted to hire a director of operations and one grants
associate and have been successful in those endeavors by the end of
the year.

GH&P org GiveWell wanted to have 3-5 signed offers for researchers in
2017 and ended up with 7. :)

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: sub; yes; pre; yes; ecm; yes;

**Claim**: EA Orgs are happy with their recent hires.

EA orgs feel that their recent hires are good and not that they need
more experience.

Post analysis more like... so ho would you test?

surveys?

EAs published more research than previous hires?

Those EAs got in more grants than previous hires? Very hard to check
and find out. Let's skip as it adds little value to us.

I think I just wanted to check if EA orgs "feel good" about their
recent hires. did they have a good conversation? did they feel like he
is good at the job without looking at any metrics?

Or same as last claims?

such a vague claims.


hard to check, very vague claim, possible to do with feelings

11. 

**Claim**: The number of good quality people are high.

**re-write claim**: The percentage of PHD's or people with greater
than 3 years in EA, and who applied and didn't get the job is greater
than 5% of total.

Need to ask orgs for info hiring round data.


But how else can I do this?

How else can we predict the quality of people who applied

There are PHDs or people with 3 years EA experience or people who
started EA chapters who applied but didn't get...

---

12. 

**Claim**: EA Orgs seem to think that there are *more candidates fit
for the job than the ones they hired* in *research*.

**re-write Claim**:  There are people they recommended to other orgs

number of prospective candidates according to EA is hard, 

But I can see the people in the last round were 2ce the number for
research <-- Skip it already done. work and focus on failures.

12. 

**Claim**: Senior staff within governments and top AI labs are
struggling to find experienced and qualified AI talent to employ.

What the fuck does struggling even mean?

Are they unable to hire people after budgeting them?

Are they looking for experienced people for a particular set of money?

what does struggling mean?

**re-write Claim** AI labs are not able to fill the positions which

Do EA orgs have room for more funding to add more hires?
^
|
|

Do their budgets remain the same for last two years? => Room for
funding more people or perhaps they don't want to grow

Do their budgets increase for hiring? => implies they have funding for hiring

Do their budgets increase for other things besides hiring? => then
they probably don't want to hire more people...


How to test "AMF has room for additional funding for more
interventions"

You can look at their budgets from the past and present and forecasts.

Look at forecasts of what they want to do and the amount of funding
they got last year? also maybe look at eventual impact?

Moving on...

----------------------------

<!-- today starts here 03/07 -->

**Claim**: AI Orgs are short on cash to hire people

orgs have allocated no more budget than last year.

Orgs don't have money allocated in their budget to hire new people. 

and if they have cash to do other things like rent a new space, then
they are probably not "short on cash"

You could also look at some indication of budget... such as salaries +
overhead minus fundraising etc...

**re-write Claim** Orgs don't allocate more budget than last year to
hire people? but they allocate more money for other things like a new
desks?

Meta orgs


- and then GH&P orgs don't seem to be short on cash for
entrepreneurship???

Budget is not avail;able...

15 claims.... work on next 15 after that...

--- 

**Claim**: We are heavily funding constrained and have the management
capacity and hiring talent pool to quickly grow if given more money.

**re-write claim**: We have forecasted

**Claim**: Orgs want to hire more people but money is stopping them
from allocating more budget.


So then it is not clear to me how to make  a claim. because I think of
RP. They want more money and have already planned it. If they get more
money this is what they are going to do. 

isn't this good enough?

Does peter say

I think the biggest problem is in the definition itself. thats where
all the stuggle is happening.agreeing that something testable is the definition.

Just looking at an unchanged budget is not make or break

When forecasts are not being met with money for hiring.

Forecasts can be on the blog.

Fundraising not being met? where the forecast allocation was for
hiring.

Its unclear if they met their fundraising gap RP: for 2019 or 2020. so far.

### claims from woek

**Claim**: When you make two measurements, error reduces by sqrt(2)

**re-write claim**: When you have random errors in your measurement,
with each measurement the uncertainty reduces by sqrt(#).

**Subject**:  When you have random errors in your measurement,
uncertainty of 1 measurement and uncertainty of 5 measurements

**Predicate**: is a factor of sqrt(n)

**Example**: There is a 99% chance that if you make a measurement your
error is within +-3sigma (provided the error is a normal dist)

But if you make 2 measurements your 99% chance of being within the
+-3sigma/sqrt(n).

You can check the SD.

**Definition**: 

**Checklist**: sub; No; pre; No; ecm; No;

**Claim**: It doens't matter what is the distribution of the random
variable. Doens't have to be normal

dice example

Works with poinsson, but a better example is indeed dice... the dandom
variable of value of die is a flat line, which becomes different 

temp.r in agent18 has the formulas

---

**Claim**: Thermal from different source adds up and doesn't

*Not doing it.*

At work I often in the recent days... Take one example and explain
things so that I understand to begin with and then add more complexity
like drift etc... to see where I stand. and test all those hypothesis.

---

**Claim**: error when you measure using a natchiappan is X not 2X

Although the TT says otherwise. The error is only shows up once.

Not sure how to write it.

---
1. 

**Claim**: You can find out the drift with an error of X with
confidence interval

If there is a static error and a random error. You can extract the
static error with uncertainty given by random error and number of
measurements.

**Claim**: Mark error adds up to caliberation error. 

**re-write claim**: Error due to caliberation of the mark

---

**Claim**: Assuming the position of the pivot point of the gripper is
constant, the effect of pick up at the PA does not affect the final
drop XY position before and after heating, as long as the temp is
constant during transfer.


---

**Claim**: The position of the pivot point affects the thermal value
over time

**re-write claim** If the position of the pivot point changes with
time, then the drift due to gripper is +ve


If pivot point moves from X1 (t1) to X2 (t2), then the change in
position of wafer at WEX between t1 and t2 is X2-X1 (roughly). This is
despite the wafer location at pick up being the exact same.
that 

---

**Claim**: Even with sensor measurement we are looking at a lost cause
to follow drift.

Current drift is at 55um. To take this out, we need 10 measurements

**Claim**: you don't need to consider Rz once you consider XY

**Claim**: coming to work is good for you?

**Claim**: Scrum works

**Claim**: it is import to come to work

**Claim**: we are not considering double counting why

Accounting for it is complicated.

Accounting for double counting of the MEtro frame and the gripper is double

**Example**: Think og the MF and the gripper. We would expect the
gripper to go from 22 to higher, while the MF can go lower or higher
than its cali temp.

Within PS, it doens't add much value? or not needs to be checked. If
Naseh confirms that they add up

What about the gripper and the PA... That can be accounted for, if
Naseh confirms that one of 22 is the minimum temperature and they both
go the expansion direction.

**Definition**: 

**Checklist**: 
 
 
---

**Claim**: Y-beam expansion is not double counting with any other part

Y-beam expansion from caliberation temperature of 22 degrees and
Metroframe expansion of 22 degrees

Y-beam and the metroframe, only one should be counted.

This is the complexit

I think it is not that complex. I can probably impliment it for the
local values atleast.

**Claim**: It doesn't feel good for the team to see you work 4 days.

The team will miss me when I am not around?

You will get less work done?

You wont be able to properly integrate with the team?

It will be a short week? No shit.

**Claim**: Calibration will give Mark Rz error


yes

**Claim**: sensor remeasuring wont work.

Sensor remeasuring will not lead to improvements in drift.

Drift keeps changeing every 15 mins by 50um

**Claim**: feducial will work really well.


**Claim**: you can only get rid of all the static values with
measuring


## My work: Where to work

**Claim**: We would benefit greatly from moving to our industry hub. 

Let's come back to this? later?

We would get smarter by moving to the industry hub

We would be persuaded to work harder than we usually do when we move
to an industry hub.

People feel the need to work harder when they are around people
working harder.


How will you test this? No idea.

working there he was in Michigan and not familiar with the EA
community at all. And that when he considered leaving GiveWell after 2
years in the HUB, three of the opportunities, including the one he
accepted was enabled by his EA network. Needless to say there are

**Claim**: It improves learning best practices

I cannot deny that i didn't learn from these guys. just by playing
with them, I got better in AOE. They teach you that you sshould not
have X villagers. They teach you that you need to use skirmishers for
archers. Period. 

They teach you to look at the game statistics, such as K/D ratio, such
as researches done. They look in a detail that is completely
unparalleled to mine. :) K

1. 

**Claim**: Geniuses are made 

**re-write Claim**: People who are atop their field trainer longer and harder
than the ones that are not.

**Subject**: How hard the people who are atop their field, work

**Predicate**: much harder than the rest.

**Example**: 

*Atop their field*: Jerry Rice is known as the greatest NFL player to
have ever lived and has his total touch down, total receptions, and
total receiving yards is greater than 50% compared to the second
place.

*How hard these people work compared to the rest*: 

> In team workouts he was famous for his hustle; while many receivers
> will trot back to the quarterback after catching a pass, Rice would
> sprint to the end zone after each reception. He would typically
> continue practicing long after the rest of the team had gone home.

> (His) workouts became legendary as the most demanding in the league, and
> other players would sometimes join Rice just to see what it was
> like. Some of them got sick before the day was over

Even the NFL players get sick. Compare this to the regular players at
school level or even me for that matter.

2. 

**Claim**: Hard work so on distinguishes the world class from the
ok players.

**re-write Claim**: number of hours of practice per week is greater
for people who were the top class (who would win most competitions)
w.r.t to people who would win (lesser competitions)

**Subject**: Number of hours of practice per week for top class
(people who won most competitions)

**Predicate**: is greater than the number of hours of practice per
week for people who would win lesser competitions

**Example**: Ericsson study shows that the "best people" practiced for
24 hrs per week and the "not so best people" practiced for 9hrs a
week. (the classification of "best" and "not so best" is done by the
book TIO based on the number of competitions)

as long as you say he is experienced then you are going to be
eternally confused. When you changed that to number of years of
experience like in a job, it suddenly changes the perspective. Wow.

**Claim**: Luck distinguishes the world class from the people who
work hard


**re-write Claim** It's not really random.

**Claim**: Just "working hard" seems to not cut it to become the
greatest of the greats aka legend.

**re-write Claim**: Just years of experience in a field doesn't count

Look at the number of people at work above 50... 

and what does greatest mean? 

No: of years of experience at a company does not make you a recognized
legend (you don't become an ASML Fellow)

**What is DP**

It is activity designed specifically to improve performance, often
with a teacher's help; it can be repeated a lot; feedback on results
is continuously available; it's highly demanding mentally, whether the
activity is purely intellectual, such as chess or business-related
activi- ties, or heavily physical, such as sports; and it isn't much
fun.


**Claim**: What Jerry rice did is DP

**re-write Claim**: Jerry Rice designed activity to specifically
improve his performance

**Example**: 

> His weight training gave him tremendous strength. His trail running
> gave him control so he could change directions suddenly without
> signaling his move. The uphill wind sprints gave him explosive
> acceleration. Most of all, his endurance training—not something that a
> speed-focused athlete would normally concentrate on—gave him a giant
> advantage in the fourth quarter, when his opponents were tired and
> weak, and he seemed as fresh as he was in the first minute. Time and
> again, that's when he put the game away.



**Definition**:

**Checklist**: 
 

**re-write Claim**: Jerry Rice repeated those activities to improve
performance a lot.

**Example**: 

> Rice and his coaches understood exactly what he needed in order to
> be dominant. They focused on those things and not on other goals that
> might have seemed generally desirable, like speed.

**Definition**: 

**Checklist**: 
 


**re-write Claim**: not fun; demanding mentally;

> There's nothing enjoyable about running to the point of exhaustion or
> lifting weights to the point of muscle failure. But these were centrally
> important activities.

the one hour I pick up the dumbells, I fail and have 8 more sets to
go. God help me. 



**re-write Claim**: feedback on results continuously available

He has trainers, he has games and all sorts of equipment and he
watches 


> His independent off-season workouts consisted of conditioning, and
> his team workouts were classroom study, reviewing of game films,
