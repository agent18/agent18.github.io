> I advise you to start practicing for the test. You can do that on the
> SHL website, for example (www.shldirect.com). Please choose: General
> Ability Test (Standard Multiple-Choice). That will help you understand
> the questions, and you will be better prepared for the actual
> assessment. Important: the practice questions are often considered
> easier than the actual test. You can use a calculator for the
> numerical part, so make sure you have it handy before you start. In
> addition to the SHL website, you can find more practice tests
> online. We recommend that you also use these. Make sure that you
> practice the correct parts! You can use a calculator for the numerical
> part, so have it ready before you start.
>
> The various components
>
> Deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning tests are designed to measure
> your ability to draw logical conclusions based on information
> provided, identify strengths and weaknesses of arguments, and complete
> scenarios using incomplete information.
>
> Numerical reasoning. Your numerical understanding and arithmetic
> skills will be tested on the basis of facts and figures in statistical
> tables. You will be shown a table or graph, followed by a question
> about it.
>
> Inductive reasoning. Here, the questions consist of a series of
> figures, the final one of which is unknown. You then have to select
> the final figure by discovering the pattern according to which the
> figures change. You do that by applying the pattern logically. This
> exercise tests your abstract and analytical reasoning capacity.
>
> Take your time
>
> The entire assessment takes about 1,5 hours. You have to finish the
> ability test, motivation questionnaire and the personality
> questionnaire in one take. You can take a break between the different
> tests/questionnaires. Make sure that once you have started a
> test/questionnaire you must finish it.
>
> You have one chance to make the assessment. The assessment results are
> valid for one year for PwC Netherlands. So make sure you take it in a
> quiet environment so you can concentrate well.
