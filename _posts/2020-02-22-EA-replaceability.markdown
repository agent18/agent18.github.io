## EAs are not replaceable

Also some statements about
	value... https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#but-wont-i-be-replaceable

According to this article, you are not replaceable.

Main argument being if you take a job the other person is freed to do
other things. But I am not sure this is true as we look at people like
EA applicant and others going to do sub optmial things?

Oh man this is going to be a long article too.

# In short

## 80khours

Basically, you are replaceable or not aka your value goes up or not,
IF the variance among TOP CANDIDATES IS HIGH, the more people apply
for a position the less replaceable you are....

80k's argument in the past (surprise surprise) that

Like how are they wrong about everything? or did the times change?

And regarding the WHEN statement atleast Peter hurford for his jobs
and EAF hiring round and Open phil seem to be thinking otherwise.

## Value created by one person

In [this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7bp9Qjy7rCtuhGChs/survey-of-ea-org-leaders-about-what-skills-and-experience?commentId=ySRBeBocRz7oSahAC) Peter and AGB start the discussion on Replaceability
in Oct 2018. 

If A who works for EAO1 is able to generate value of
500k<span>$</span> and B is able to generate 400k at EAO1 what is the
value for the world?

It is 900k if B finds something for his similar in another EAO. It is
500k if B is not able to get a job considering the opportunity
cost. Also it is 500k if B takes the job and A ETGs 100k.

So if A has the option to ETG 100k and B takes EAO1, or if A takes the
EAO1 job it is the exact same value to the world.

But if A has the option to ETG 150k and B takes EAO1, this is
definitely better than A working at EAO and B becoming jobless.

More realistically...

Let's say A can create 500k units of value and B can create 400k units of
value at EAO1 if they get a job. A would like to compare if he should
work for EAO1 or ETG. 

**Case 1:** A can ETG 150k and B can 

**Claims**: The value of taking up a job at an EAO is equal to the
difference in value with the last potential applicant.

**Example**: A can produce 500k and B can produce 400k at an EAO. 

Total value if A takes the job and B does nothing is 500k

Total value if B takes the job and A does nothing is 400k

Total value if B takes the job and A does work for 100k in ETG, is
500k. 

So it appears that if I can instead ETG 150k then I should give up the
job at EAO, even if I am producing a value of 500k. Wow.

**Claims**: If A is better than B and B can get any job anywhere, A
should take up the job. 

A can produce 500k and B can produce 400k at an EAO. 

Total value if A takes the job and B does nothing is 500k

Total value if A takes that job and B works for 50k is 550k.

Total value if A takes that job and B works for 10k is 510k.

**Claims**: It looks like I should take up EAO, if I will be the best
in it. Well... No it seems to depend on what each can ETG.

**Claims**: let's see what if A and B produce no difference @ EAO.

|   |          |          |          |          |             |

If there are many B's then is it even worth me struggling to be as
good as B? to only end up with 2k extra?

With two similar guys, its pointless to fight to be at the top....
	


If B can do anything else, 
 




What is the value for the world?

What is the value you add to the org?

What is the value for the org in taking you over the next best applicant?

An org potentially wants to create as much value as possible, so
