    > Your answer to the first part (internal validity) was really
    > excellent (and one of the best).
    >
    > Your answer to the second part was weaker (this was true for
    > almost every candidate). I would have loved to see some 'meta'
    > comments on the overall strategy, e.g: What is going to be
    > difficult about getting this information? What can we do to
    > address these difficulties? What are the trade-offs we are
    > having to make? What will the nonprofit's perspective be? As a
    > manager, it's really helpful to be presented with a plan, but
    > also why you reached this plan, with pointers to the decisions
    > you've made and alternatives you could have taken.
    >
    > The fact you have less experience in the nonprofit/mental health
    > sector also factored slightly into the decision (generally we
    > choose ability over experience, but in this case, we have little
    > time to train someone).
