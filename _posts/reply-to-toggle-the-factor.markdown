Wow, Clearly I didn't understand the idea of baseline at all. Good
that you pointed it out. It's clear in this context.

*Live Feed:* "Can you see any potential problem here?" Umm I don't
think there is a problem. Bro, he is trying to explain the reason why
the rat continues to go the station where the food was previously.

He is testing some relevant factors (changing the shade of the door),
and then unable to explain the change in outcome (rat still doing
exactly the same thing as before), he is discarding the relevant
factors he came up with. Hurray! He's on the right track. If you don't
explain change chuck it. Adhu dhane culture?

Hmmm. I am not sure what you are trying to say here. I don't think you
are saying Young should have done better. But then you say there is a
problem, but there seems to be no problem. Young meticulously got to
the change, and the conclusion in the end.

As for the value this example created, I am unsure. But as a finale
for the essay I would keep something where the protogonist makes a
mistake and someone (or an STM) saves the day by using the
hypothesis. For example, the "Fake Explanations" example or the
"regrets before dying" example. People made mistakes and someone had
to come out and save the day.

Crystal!

> + Was the hypothesis clear? Why should you toggle a factor?

Yes. Removing the aluminum prism was a toggle to check if it was a
relevant factor.

> + Could you tell that toggling also included changing it in degrees?

Only later in the essay I understand that your intention could be that
RF's are not all explicit, they could be hidden. It was nice that you
pointed about what all toggling could mean, viz. changing degrees,
removing the prism all together, changing the material etc...

> + Was it clear when it said that a proposed model should show that
>   its relevant factors are actually relevant? How do you do that?

Yes it is clear. The N-rays example clarifies that.

> + Was the caveat about baselines clear?

Yes. In that particular case of diesel engine.

"Another caveat is that if the system needs several relevant factors
and some of them are missing and you toggle a factor, you will not
learn anything about that factor because the outcome will remain the
default outcome".

Maybe this can be written "better". For example, if you say
"dependency of a relevant factor on one another" and immediately
deliver an example (car acceleration on ignition) and then go on with
your explanation it would be lesser labels and easy to follow I
think. The whole para has way too many labels that I just skip the
content, go to the example and then come back and read the hypothesis.

I think you mean the "ignition starting and releasing the handbrake",
as "non-default outcome". Can't this also be interpreted as the
baseline?  Baseline being "ignition and releasing handbrake"?

> + Were you able to follow the HPMOR pouch example? Did you get all
>   the claimed relevant factors? Were you able to toggle them?

Yes was able to follow the example for most parts except the
baselines. I thought of a few relevant factors myself (how close the
hand was to the pouch), but it shocked me that literally every word
was a relevant factor.

"Most children would have at least waited to get their wands
first". Didn't understand what this line was doing in the block quotes.

"English language was not relevant at least for this baseline." Would
it be possible to write out in brackets what the baseline is? I am
literally unable to think of what it could be here.

"Seems like the contents are not relevant for the baseline of
mentioning the time at which the item was put in. But they may be
relevant if you don’t mention the time."

I read it a couple of times and came back to it, and I get what you
are saying. You are saying that "contents are relevant or not"
depending on the baseline. Maybe an example here?

"Remember to toggle all kinds of factors, even ones that seem pretty
relevant. Maybe they aren’t." Why? example? 

> + Did the other examples help? Could you see how Pasteur unpacked
>   "air"?

So up until now it was easy to read what you were saying but suddenly
it felt like the level went up "stoppering a flask". I had a hard time
imagining "air to boiled liquid". 

I re-read this example and it is quite clear now. Maybe the first time
I read it, I had to adpat to several new labels, "swan nest flask",
"tilt to touch the flask" etc...

Maybe a bit of context might help a dumb reader to smoothly read it
the first time.

To conclude. Yes I get what he did.

> + Was the "active voice" example helpful? What about the way to test
>   the impact of techniques?

Wait, what did you test? where did you toggle? Atleast it was not explicit.

> + Did you learn anything new? 

I learn't that there are so many hidden relevant factors (HPMOR
example). And that toggling the factors can help you keep or discard
it if there is no change in the output. Also relevant factors have
dependencies (non-default outcome). 

I am still struggling with baseline (as mentioned in different parts
of this feedback).

> Could you see any useful applications?   

**Claims**: Time for writing is an important factor for delivering
quality content where things are explained clearly or "everything" has
examples.

**RF's**: Time between writing, Time spent on writing, difficulty of
content, prior homework on content, length of essay amongst others are
all relevant factors. (I have not spent effort on determining every
single hidden factor like HP did in Chapter 6).

**NTD**:So I look at the last 4 essays of yours that you wrote in this
summer. There by controlling for "difficulty of content", "prior
homework done on content", "length of essay" (all essays have 6 to 7
examples). These also provide the baselines.

**Reduced RF's**The two relevant factors available are "time between
writing" and "time spent on writing". I don't have info of time spent on
writing. But I shall toggle "time between essay" and see if it
produces a change in output. I assume time of writing is proportional
to the time available between essays and hopefully can get away with it.

**Conclusion**

Previously I would have believed such claims and moved on. Cause you
know, my internal feelings are solid gold. Recently I would have said
well there is no way to prove it or that I have to come up with one
example and it is going to be hard. So lets go home and sleep
instead. It's not conclusive anyways. Now "I have the skills" and I
have to push myself to get to "a result", by ECNAO and NTD and
TTF. "Controlling shit", and "looking at baselines" and all the
shabang. So what do you think of the outcome? It is a relevant factor.

> Thanks again for your feedback. 

Your Welcome and thank you too! PNN!

We only know it is a relevant factor. Looking at the essays from the past
and the posting frequency, and CONTRASTING it to what you are doing
with the last 3 essays. Agreed! But that's all we can say as a result
of toggling the "quick" in the feedback for the outcome of "writing
faster" aka posting often(er).

We just can't use the last 3 essays and say, "ah indeed an STM is
writing faster". We need to look for the change in output for a change
in input. We need to ECNAO.

"I wasn’t able to figure out how Harry came up with those tests for the
magic pouch (and for all kinds of problems through HPMOR). Once I hit
upon the idea of toggling factors, it was a piece of cake. Toggling
for the win!"

Word!

**Other points**

~~Macha, I would prefer you guide me regarding which part of the essay
the question is directed to, using some `""` or pointing to an example
as I am trying to answer your questions as I read the essay. For
example, the "non-default outcome" question,~~

**Aluminium prism**

"If the aluminium prism is truly a relevant factor, then changing it
should result in some change in the output variable (for at least some
baselines)."

I realize how I completely missed the concept of baselines with the
example of Scooby in my last essay. What is the baseline you are
referring to though, Can I get an example please!

**Paul Graham**

Didn't get this example. What is the relevant factor and output here?
Where is the toggling? Where is the change in output? And more
especially, where is the example within PG's claim.
