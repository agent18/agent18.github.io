July 21 pain massive in the morning. afte 9 am, not much pain alright

A few days later, I think I tried kwark again and  pain in the stomach, quite a lot. No loss of appetite.
So started worrying about keeping up with my protein intake and stuff.

- Am I lactose intolerant? 
    -whey doesn't seem to be a problem?
    -kwark gves lot of gas atleast in the toilet

- Is lot of gas generated a bad thing? Happens when I eat kwark (for sure)

- Does gas generally happen with takeing lot of protein

- I am currently staying away from milk products such as milk, kwark.. butter, rozen brood I still eat

- How to know if I have bloating? What does it mean? Somtimes I feel uncomfortable, like my jean is too tight, which I might not feel at other times.

- Have orange juice about 500 ml per day...

-Appendicitis etc... how to know? Bloating how to know?


pain in the ankle for atleast ~2 weeks now, doens't go but causes no harm.. pain in touching the fore leg!
