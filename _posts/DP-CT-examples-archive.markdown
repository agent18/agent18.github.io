<!-- Jesus the number of time s I am thinking about useless things! -->

<!-- Having a girlfriend! Awesome -->

<!-- Saving the guy who is about to get hit by a car! YES -->

<!-- Having lunch with friends, learning music, playing basketball! -->

So the SIYH is fuzzy. It is not clear due to the vacillating,
contradicting feelings through which we see it. One moment you are
inspired to save 100s of lives, next moment you are thinking about how
to get laid. The box is useless in this case. But even though
the solution is inside your head, we seem to be not sure what to do,
i.e., to go after having loads of sex, or to save people. We don't
know, what we truly want. We seem to be having wavering thougths. and
strong thougths some times and weak thoughts at other
moments. example: I want to inspire the whole fucking world, dedicate
my life to this, with years and years of heavy deliberate practice and
then moments when will I be her boyfriend and shit like this! Jesus
Wake up Pandian! WTF is going on!

So far we have established that there is a SIYH, which you use to
judge the solution provided. It looks like you also don't understand
completely the SIYH, evident by the inconsistencies in your thoughts with
time. No matter what the box says it looks like you are pretty
much going to do what you do. But if you think about it there have
been times when you were willing to "change" the SIYH! Once upon a
time, I thought being GAY was fucked up. But now I realize that fuck,
they are also people, who am I to say how they should live, what gives
me the authority to judge them as fucked up? Hmmm. That'd odd.! It
almost looks as if the SIYH can be modified by external Boxes. In this
case, someone used logic to modify the SIYH. In other words the SIYH,
the fundamental rules that we posses were used to modify the SIYH
using some external box. This can also be interpreted as a Map vs
territory problem.

But we seem to be making a lot of mistakes?
In addition we also have Hueristics and Biases (H&B's) to
help us steer in the "right direction". For example, if several people
do something, you are rewarded to do that action, this is called
social proof. For example, bursting crackers when everybody else does
is somehow much more thrilling than doing it the next day. There is
almost no interest to do it the next day. Another example is in
football stadiums, where there are so many people chanting and doing
wierd stuff, that when you are alone and do it else where it is not as
fun, that is why they have laughter tracks in sitcoms to feel
compelled to laugh. These H&B's sometimes steer us in the wrong
direction. It was just meant as a shorcut to know quickly what is
right and what is wrong (it has an evolutionary meaning). So we
initiall have a rough SIYH, with some rules including the H&B's, based
on the H&B social proof, we somehow develop an aversion to people who
are gay. And we don't even realize that it happens this way. Then one
day you meet an STM and he brings a box. The box says, "There is no
reason to assume that being gay is bad, there are no health
consequences, they do it in their own bedroom, they are also people
just like fucking us, they feel the way the do not because they chose
to be that way and even if they chose to be that way, so what, who are
you to judge, why do you hate them just because they are
different. H&B's are only meant for helping you with fast
computations, they could be grossly wrong". You use the current map,
the rough SIYH, and you see that it is iron clad logic, everyone of
the sentences agrees with the rough SIYH. The rough SIYH, map is then
modified, closer to the True SIYH, the terrain.

It appears that some rules have more power than the other. ""



should be vs want to
Saving people on the other side of the planet! I should be doing it 



P.S

one minute I am thinking yes, I will kill at a skill, I will spend
years on it and the next I am thinking why didn't she tell me, do I
have a chance to fuck her or if I have a chance to meet other girls!
Jesus! Man talk about motivation.

Imaging going to Eleizer and talking about this, he is going to spit
on your face. He be like, Thej are you for real? 3rd world vs 1st
world really? I had bigger hopes for you!
