## introduction

Last week I have clocked 7 hrs (had some office work and some office
related social stuff I "needed to do" but I still managed to properly
procrastinate in the weekends), Week before that 12 hrs (something
came up in the weekends), week before that 31 hrs and week before that
7 hrs. OK without going into the depth of where all I
procrastinated. All this despite working 32 hours a week
only. Weekends been having some outings, or vacation trip with friends
or someones 30th birthday, or I am hungover etc... all this and a
whole ton of procrastination. There was some distraction or the
other. Nevertheless I know for a fact I have been procrastinating.

I think I feel like shit for doing nothing this sunday, despite being
sane and shit. Woke up late, slept again and did nothing other than
write my email to an STM and setup my degiro account. All in all not
counted for important stuff that I need to do and it's a whole bunch
of waste.

Work includes stuff like prepping for indrews or writing or thinking,
anything outside my 32hrs of work.

This is disgusting. Please pick up your shit Agent18. Let's get back.


Add a line of retreat... It's ok, I will not post this yes. I will fix
it and then post it. Ok? Then there will be no STM judgining the hell
out of me.


## what I think are the issues

1. When I make a pact with money, for the most part I am able to stick
   with it
   
   But making the pact is the hard part.
   
   Lets' keep it simple. I have to commit to 30 hrs a week (at any
   cost). I haev a 32 hrs job. People like guzey try to do 80hr work
   weeks. I need to start at 62 (including work).
   
   that would mean 4 hrs a day for a 5 days a week. One day of the
   week I am allowed 4-8 hrs of leasure. That is ok. And I also want
   to play basketball. No problem.
   
   For example, this week I will do 4hrs 5 days a week and then follow
   it up with 5 hrs on saturday and 5 hrs on sunday.
   
2. I love taking a nap after 18:30. when I go to my bed on top, its so
   hard to get off unless it is 8 o clock.  
   
   Really schedule this shit. Everyday from 18:00 hrs to 23:00 is my
   work with half hour break, no distractions.
   
   I really need to avoid this
   
3. I need to come up with concrete things to work on that day. This
   essays are going to be exploratory.
   
   I am happy to work on data science, there are "more concrete
   things" to do there than this exploratory type of work.
   
   High feedback tasks like coding (dealroom assignment) or the ikea
   indrew assignment where I had a deadline and was grinding more than
   9 hrs a day in the weekend despite having a bum hand. That's the
   type of ambience that seems to work.
   
4. reward myself, leave something easy and hanging to start the next
   time, log your fucking distractions during your work,( it's ok,
   don't be harsh (LLOR) count it as your work time for now), but just
   keep time of it.

5. major distractions, phone, freinds, tv, and girl who I talk to
   ... disgusting.
   
6. committing and havign consequence works

7. PDC yourself (don't go for 4 weeks but start with 2 days if that is
   easy to start with).
   
8. don't be distracted by useless women and don't be distracted by the
   possibility of sex and please don't go lengths to get there. It's
   ok to be a virgin. It's really ok.
   
9. Taking forever to start... Naturally starting is a MYTH.

10. Fixed times of sleep and wake up.


11. Need to think of a way to record how focussed I am, 

12. How can I plan things? thigns take thier own sweet time... How to
    go about it?
	
	
## goal

I am going to make a post on productivity. I am going to make claims,
I am going to make tests and I am going to log the results. This is
the fucking goal. Let's go. Inbetween one day I have shit to do with
the indrew. but that is ok.

I am writing this for myself, I will publish it on my blog though.

Derive heavily from the works of "greats".

It's ok... today I will do 3 hrs. for lack of clarity. but from now
on... 18hrs I need to start. how to make things a habit?

Count how productive you are... The amount of distractions... 

Read something in the night... dont' waste time on fb and other things.

### guzey

Start here: https://guzey.com/co-working/

make notes: start here -->

Guzey says, it is hard for him to focus unless it is coding, writing
or playing video games. I kind of have the same impression. Even with
writing maybe it is hard for me, when I don't know what to write about
or that it is a different kind of exploratory writing. But
"in-general" yes.

high-productivity --> 80 hours of "focused work".

difficult project --> long feedback loops, no "well-defined scope", no
real deadline

He suggests to consider how focused you are in a coding assignment
compared to doing the difficult tasks (how do I compare?), but I
"agree" with his statement. If you think of it in the amount of time
spent doing the task, I have always struggled to do even 6 hours of
work, but on that day with the coding assignment and deadline I did 9
hrs that day. With my kaggle projects i seem to have worked more than
6 hrs on a saturday and I would say with relative ease considering the
amount of feedback you get and concrete personal deadlines you have in
mind. 

Even with writing I think with claims I have made 6 hrs or more. I
have done 3 hrs at a fucking stretch (maybe cause I was looking
something up and we know I really get engrossed in looking for a
particular information.). So what is an example of this difficult task
boy?

I do see many places where I worked for 17 mins, 13 mins, 1 hr and not
longer if you know what i mean when writing the career essay. It was
hard task, not knowing how to conclude, kinda being exploratory. Not
having the information you need, I .. Hard to motivate, hard to get
work done???

This is vague I accept it. but we shall move on.

Forexample, now, when I really didn't have a clear idea what to do
this week, I procrastinated, I said I was going to work in the evening
for 4 hrs on sunday. and even today, I procrastinated the hell and
slept until the 8.

It's particularly hard to "not dealy work for half of the day" and
easy to "stop work in the middle of the day"

Guzey also points out the failure of non-precommited-on-the-spot 1min
writing. I have no motivation to try it even. I tell myself, ah I
should try starting and leave it at that. I somehow find it hard to
get out of that bed and do this shit.

I know a thing or 2 about commitments, they get the job done in many
cases. And I like what guzey says about doing this. It's only the
making part of the commitment in presence of uncertainties that is
hard. But I would like a system where I can sit and have a checker
that forces me ot think about 1) what we are working on and 2) if we
are focused or not. And in particularly difficult assignments you have
5 min chat-checkins. 


And yeah biggest fucking problem is the waking up and starting work. 

### producvity thoughts by this guy


Is routine something to consider. 18 hrs means 18 hrs... EOD.

I want to write about if the place I am in is a problem or not.. Let's
look for specific examples.

Guzey is suggesting something about changing location, where you have
specific rules. I remember working "well" during my olden times when I
was grinding after work, I would just eat and sit at the library and
go to home only to work. I chose this extreme step as a consequence
that I was not getting work done at home. I would lie down and shit
would break loose after that.

There used to be a time 

I would like to really consider working in a library again... but I
will have only one screen... it didn't matter then, would it matter
now? or perhaps during weekends?

Having something to remind myself from time to time to log what
productivity thing I am using that week and if not why? suggests
amazing marvin

Seems like an important point

How to plan out longer feedback events? I often run away from them or
do them for a bit and they become to the point like I cannot learn
anything from them ... I am also thinking how to get notifications
like a google form to fill at random times...

### Peter Hurford
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTHe5oGvdj6T73o4o/how-i-am-productive


Peter says, there should e no email in the mail box and that it should
be split to action, waiting, and reference.

- Make to-do lists into 4 quadrants.

- Plan your day in advance (plan everyminute), but what to do when you
  are unable to really estimate how long it takes

- Be comfortable with breaks

- review and reflect regularly daily, weekly, monthly and once in six
  months
  
  - reviews month and writes a post on it for 2 hrs.
  - 6 month review think about how life is going? what are my life
    goals, Am I closer to them? What should I be working on? Write
    goals and personal mission for the next six months. I have never
    done this... and skim it everyweek.
	
- make things a routine, I will not even argue... Working out runs
  like clock work for me... For example...

**Commiting**

- beeminder, make a bet with a friend


### Paul Christino

https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4gud47NNqgtsEeEr/my-workflow

- Workflowy for to-do lists
  - daily 
  - future
	
- Beeminder just like Petertje
  - for daily routine
  - min. amount of work

- Reflect and produce concrete possible changes

- pomodoro of 20 and 3

- time logging

This is a trick that I use for getting out of bed in the morning -
quite literally:  I count down from 10 and get out of bed after the
"1".

it's not "free will" it's "free won't".

### Scott alexander

Commit, make an oath, don't do it too often, haev release valves. It
feels like an actual external deadline or where your boss is expecting
you to show up for work.


https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NjzBrtvDS4jXi5Krp/applied-picoeconomics?commentId=aTxrGdthcX2FrrdfT

A beautiful comment on committing... Be careful on failing as it sets
a bad precedent.


May people have this issue, good to know... Even planning
