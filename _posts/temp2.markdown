Vandaag ga ik over geregeld huwelijk praten










## Arrange Marriage

I would like to keep it light today. Nothing serious. So I am going to
talk about the my arranged marriage.

Ik wil het vandaag graag licht houden. Niets serieus. Dus dat ga ik
praaten over het gearrangeerde huwelijk.

What is arranged marriage you ask? That is a good question.

Wat is een gearrangeerd huwelijk dat je vraagt? Dat is een goede
vraag.

It is when two people meet for the first time and decide to get
married over a week as arranged by their parents. 



One of my friends recently was introduced to a girl. First the parents
of the girl visited. and then the other way. Following that, they go
to the balcony in the huis and talk for few minutes. 

They chat on the phone for the coming week and meet up for dinner
somewhere and that is that.

They are engaged now. Weddings in April. 

In India it appears that it is very important to get married before 30
at any cost otherwise you will not get a suitable bride. My parents
keep giving me the example of this guy who lives downstairs and say
that I will become like him. 

As much as this might sound weird or funny, everyone goes through it,
whether you are hot or whether you are ugly. And India has the least
divorce rates although, 15%. Although that could be for other reasons
such as social stigma associated with divorces.

So coming to me. Yes. My parents are forcing the hell out of me to get
married. They talk in sly ways and think they are subconciously
manipulating me. If I say, oh I don't have good food or I am sick, or
My birthcertificate doesn't have a name (really!). they think a
marriage would help me with all of this.

My mother is really hurt that I say no. I would think it causes her a
lot of stress, anxiety and a ton of social pressure. Everyones getting
married and they expect me to be like everybody. And that is where the
problem comes.

I love my parents they have done a lot for me but I don't think it is
a barter system, so for me I think it is clear.

Today, I would like to attempt a conveying a cogent argument about why
I think California, especially the Silicon Valley might be a great
place to be. The way I am going to do it, is I am going to make some
claims and then follow it up with examples.

1. Industries cluster in certain areas:

Look at eindhoven for example, If you want to be in Lithography or
hightech you have to stop and go there. There is no future here for
us. 

Silicon Valley is the start up capital racking a whopping 140bn in
funding in just 7 years, highest in the world. Lot of the biggest tech
giants are somehow conveniently gathered there. Apple, Facebook,
Google, Netflix, Uber, KLA, Udacity, SPaceX, Tesla,

Ik wil het vandaag graag licht houden. Niets serieus. Dus dat ga ik doen
praat over het gearrangeerde huwelijk.

Wat is een gearrangeerd huwelijk dat je vraagt? Dat is een goede vraag. Ik zal het zeggen.

Het is wanneer ouders je aan een meisje voorstellen en je het huwelijk binnen één week accepteert.

Ik zal u een voorbeeld geven.

Mijn vriend werd voorgesteld aan een meisje. Eerst de ouders
van het bezochte meisje. en dan de andere kant op. Daarna gingen ze
naar het balkon in het huis en praat een paar minuten.

Ze berichtten en praatten een week lang.
Ze zijn nu verloofd. Het huwelijk is in april.
