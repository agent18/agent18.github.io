#### **Biases recap!**
Availability bias: For example, we tend to overestimate either the probability of dying in a plane crash or of a suicide or murder. In this case I would estimate that the probablity of a murder is more likely. Availability bias looks at which information is more readily available to us, and makes its decision based on it.

Identifiable victim effect: Apparently there is a greater tendency to donate when requests are accompanied with images of particular victims than factual statements, even when the statements raise the utility of donating. This (also is similar to availability as given in the [article][jcn])) basically informs us that our biases have a more visual tendancy than listening to facts. 

> The donations are a function not of the recipients need but a useful, but error-prone proxy, emotional impact of a request. 

For me this only more and more clarifies that biases are stright from loserville. But what next, I have no clue!
