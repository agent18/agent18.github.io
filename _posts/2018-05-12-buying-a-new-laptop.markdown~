## Current laptop

- mouse pad not fully useable, but I still can continue to use it
- Sleep doesn't last long on ubuntu, I also think the same with
windows 10.
4 years old

## Do I want to solve it or get a new laptop

### Solving it

I think I have a few more hours to decide if something will work or
not. There seem to be options for hybernation, but ultimately I would
like something that I can suspend and move from one place to
another. I think the current sleep capability is definitely a few
hours(3-6 hrs).

#### Worries

For when I need it to be reliable for more than 1 day?


how often does that happen?


Fucking up the battery by keeping it on for ever?

Hybernation slow? not the same as suspend?

Ideally I would liek something that I can close and open at will, and
not have to worry about reducing the battery life (estimated at 50
Euros/piece). The life of this Laptop @ max is expected to be 2 years,
but it runs amazingly now. Software centre opens in no fucking time
at all. Shocking.

The life of a battery is about 500 recharges after which it reduces in
capability, (~2 years). I remember for my HP laptop I did buy a new
battery 3 years after living. I used the fuck out of the battery,
always kept it in charge etc.. I can't remember when I actually lost
control of the battery. But I use that laptop for everything.
