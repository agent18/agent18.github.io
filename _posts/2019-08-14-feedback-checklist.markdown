## Feedback list

**Feedback checklist:**

1. Could it have examples? remember: "civilization is at stake due to AI"
   (consider the possibility it has not examples)

2. True or false? Remember: "There is no doubting the
   force of the argument" (consider a falsifying example)

3. best most no comparison? Remember: "The best career capital is got by working
on the most important problems." (consider if you need to compare)

4. From chapter?  (consider examples from chapter)

5. Running? Remember: "Characteristics of DP explained with tiger
   woods alone" (consider if it is a running example)

6. If-then If Given? "Given that we want batsmen who are short and
have curly hair, here are the batsmen we found: Sachin Tendulkar"
(consider the given type statements)


**Checklist at the end of every example-claim sequence**: 

**Checklist**: yes; false; best; not-chapter; not-running; if  

## Failure scenarios

We don't care about beliefs!

**beliefs**

> **Claims**: Crime should not pay
>
> **Subject**: Crime
>
> **Predicate**:  Should not pay
>
> **Example**: 3000 people were killed by AL-Qaeda in the US (9-11).
>
> **Definition**: checks out I think!
>
> **Checklist**: not-sure; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none

> This is a predicate based on his beliefs about what is right and
> wrong, not on empirical examples. "Crime does not pay" is a predicate
> about the world and it would be false if the average crime led to a
> lot of money without imprisonment. "Crime **should** not pay" can be
> skipped for now. ("The Holy B says that crime should not pay" is
> testable, though.)

**X prefers A to B**

> Many prisoners prefer to do jobs, instead of having to sit in their
> cells all day
>
> Subject: What prisoners prefer
>
> Predicate: to do jobs instead of having to sit in their cells all
> day.
>
> Example: ~~The Firefighter prisoners in the video found working
> "rewarding".~~ I don't have any examples for this

Good job! If you failed here, you can note down this pattern "X
prefers A to B", so that you can focus on it in the future and stop
making that mistake. Just like you would focus on two-digit
multiplication if that's where you have failed in the past. For
example, "a certain Agent prefers not marrying to marrying or not
having kids to having kids".

"But I don't have any examples of the case where the aforementioned
Agent has kids!" -- Ask the people selling this to you for smaller
claims that you can test right now, such as "you will like holding a
baby" or "changing a diaper ain't all that bad" or "people don't get
too upset when their kids disobey them".

**testable**

**many clains in one**

**cryptic predicate**

**simple past**

**The future of nothing**

**emperically false**

**Comparitive** **No best most**

**unable to get example** aka "fat claims"

**Time taking example**

## Things we skip

*because*

*should*

> (Crime)[0] should (not pay)[1], is (very simple common sense)[2].

**Claims**: Crime should not pay

**Subject**: Crime

**Predicate**:  Should not pay

**Example**: 3000 people were killed by AL-Qaeda in the US (9-11).

**Definition**: checks out I think!

**Checklist**: not-sure; true; none; not-chapter; not-running; none 

## DP09 Claims

Based on the feedback from an STM documented [here](/DP-feedback-key-ideas.html):



## Todo 

- reclassify running and not-true items?
- rewrite a summary of lessons learnt
- along with the different scenarios.
