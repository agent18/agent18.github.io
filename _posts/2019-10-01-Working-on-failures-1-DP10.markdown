## Working on failures

The plan of this essay is to look [here](placeholder), for where all I sucked in
this practice session. Take some of them and try some "high repetition".

With this essay I take on the identifying the following:

- When a claim is a belief
- When a claim cannot be tested
- Some special cases of splitting the Subject Predicate where I
  failed.
- Working on claims that have adjectives in them.

With every new section I start of with one example where I failed and
then carry on with the practice.

**Note**: The link shown above, is not fully edited, but it was my
manual attempt to classify all the errors according to patterns.

## Beliefs about right or wrong 

**STM**:

> (Crime)[0] should (not pay)[1], is (very simple common sense)[2].
>
> Claims: Crime should not pay
>
> Definition: checks out I think!

This is a predicate based on his beliefs about what is right
and wrong, not on empirical examples. “Crime does not pay” is a
predicate about the world and it would be false if the average crime
led to a lot of money without imprisonment. “Crime should not pay” can
be skipped for now. (“The Holy B says that crime should not pay” is
testable, though.)

**Pattern**: "is common sense" or similar?

Examples about the future, examples that predict the future; cases
where there are no examples from the past, i.e., it is new, all seem
to fall under this category. I think the goal here shall be to see if
things can be tested or not. For example the below example cannot be
tested. There is no AI unfortunately to test your shit on and see if
HC is at stake. (I realize this only during re-reading my work.)

## IF

**STM**

> (These areas)[6a] can be (particularly worth pursuing)[7] if you’re
> (especially motivated by one of them)[8].

Your response:

> For [6a] we think of, working in promoting EA as in the above
> example.

> For [8], we think of a personal fit of more than 50%

> For [7], we think of an impact of 5300*50%=2650 lives which is
> better than working a DS job resulting in 530 net people.

But that doesn’t use [8] at all. Why is it particularly worth pursuing
if you are “especially motivated”? The “impact” [7] you pointed out
would seem to be the same if you had [8] or if you didn’t.

I would expect an example where someone who had this magical [8] went
on to have particularly great “impact”. And I suspect that they do not
have that example.

Consider this: You can bowl a particularly high bouncer if you’re 6
feet tall. Showing Bhuvaneshwar Kumar bowling a bouncer is not an
example. You have to show Courtney Walsh bowling a bouncer that is one
foot higher than usual bouncers.

**Claims**: ^^

**Example**: In the study, a person with an IQ of 85, was able to pick
out the top horse in 10/10 races. Whereas a person with IQ 118, picked
up the top horse for 3/10 cases.

**Claims**: If you toggle the input factor, you can see if it has any
impact on the output.

**Example**: Blondlot claimed that if you have an aluminium prism and
a treated thread of cadmium sulfide, you will get a faint glowing in
the dark. 

"One day Blondlot had given a demonstration of N-Rays. The lights had
turned out, and his assistant had called off the brightening and
darkening as Blondlot performed his manipulations."

"It had been a normal demonstration, all the results going as
expected. Even though an American scientist named Robert Wood had
quietly stolen the aluminium prism from the center of Blondlot’s
mechanism."

This way we know the prism did jack shit to the output.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true.
 
---

**Claims**: if you don't toggle the input factor, you won't know if it
has any effect at all.

**Example**: Blondlot didn't toggle the prism, and he didn't know that
it had no effect on his experiment or the production of N-rays.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true.

**Example**: When the sound for the horror movie was lowered as
opposed to the "original" sound, the movie appeared to be much less
scary.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

---

> Visuals were not as important as the sound

**Claims**: ^^

movie was still "pretty scary". Where as watching the Visuals with
muted sound was not at all scary.

**Source**: Talent is overrated

**Claims**: Talents are much less important than we usually think.

**Example**: Lazlo Polgar, married someone with the intention of
making his kids prodigies in some sport. He later chose Chess as that
would be easy to measure. Judit polgar became grandmaster at 15. Susan
Polgar became top ranked female player at the age of 15. She is also a
woman grandmaster. The odds that he was able to make all his kids
grandmasters is the evidence for the claim.

 > Coaches advice are important
 
**Example**: I go often to shoot balls in the court and practice. This
particular day, had been after a few weeks of 0 practice. I kept
shooting and I got I think something like 20% shooting over maybe 100
shots (I should probably give up). My friend (who is extremely good)
saw me and said I was all over the place with my action, performing
different motions for every single shot, suggested I shoot from the
fore head in one motion and for the next 10 shots kept criticizing my
every move.

Almost instantaneously, I started nailing every single shot. It didn't
take that much effort even to push the ball. Averaged 50%, which was
pretty sick for 50 shots and my highest in a while considering my
recent hiatus.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true.

I do not think I can find an example for the above claim mainly
because of "most". How do I give an example that out of all the
factors, "repetition" is the most important.

If I think of the basketball example I gave earlier, "feedback" was
the most important rather than practice at that point.

**Checklist**: yes; neither;
*no-example*

> Most important thing you can do to improve performance is not fun

**Claims**: ^^

**Subject**: Most important thing you can do to improve your performance 

**Predicate**: is no fun

**Example**: As a highest level figure skater, Shizuka Arakawa trained
on the jumps she couldn't do. Arakawa's road to the gold medal
involved at least twenty thousand derriere impacts on an unforgiving
surface.

**Definition**:  It cannot be fun to fall on ice on your ass 20000 times.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

> Another important variable is how much effort a person puts into it
> (practice)

**Claims**: ^^

**Subject**: The effort put by person.

**Predicate**: is an important variable.

**Example**: A study of singers found that when amateurs took a voice
lesson, they experienced it as an enjoyable release of tension, but
when professionals took a lesson, they experienced it as an intense,
difficult effort.

**Definition**: checks out

**Checklist**: yes; true;

**Example**: A study of violinists found that by the top violinists
had 7410 hours of lifetime practice whereas the "ok" students at the
institute clocked 3420 hours.

*I concede that I have not dealt with the large numbers part but
assume the study took sufficiently large numbers*

**Definition**: checks out. These trends seem to inform us that more
practice leads to greatness.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

**Checklist**: yes; neither;

> Reaction time doesn't play an important role, but the stakes can be
> extremely high (regarding reading X-rays).


**Claims**: Reaction time doesn't play an important role in reading
X-rays

**Example**: A radiologist roughly takes 5 seconds to decide if a
chest X-ray is normal. If he takes 1 second more or 10s more, the
consequence is not much other than it adds cost to the hospital.

Where as a tennis player needs to be able to react to the ball in
0.47s otherwise he loses the game.

**Definition**: checks out.  

**Checklist**: yes; true.

> Excellent performers in other fields have learned to spot
> non-obvious information that's important.

**Claims**: ^^

**Subject**: What excellent performers have learned to spot

**Example**: Top Tennis players look at a servers body and not at the
tennis ball to understand where the ball is expected.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true;

---

> the most important ingredient in any expert system is knowledge

**Claims**: One of the most important ingredients in any expert system is
knowledge.

**Example**: Despite having state of the art computer systems and
programmers and programs rich in general inference methods, the
AlphaGo still seems to need millions of games to train on before it
defeated the GO champion 4-1.

**Definition**: checks out.

**Checklist**: yes; true.
