Mr. Agent,

Great job on spending 29 hours in a week! I recommend measuring rate of phrases per hour.

> I spent quite some time, wondering why I hated kids so much. Not one repulsive example came to my mind

Excellent. A failed scenario.

> For example, instead of spending 40000 Euros on your kids, you could use it to save 'I don't know how many fucking lives'. Period. Did you know (primary schools)[8] cost (2 to 3k Euros in India)[9]? Why would I unnecessarily- having seen (a lot of parents in my life)[10]- get myself into (this bullshit)[11]. I have (no interest)[12] in (starting a family)[13]. I have (my parents, my brother and a whole lot of friends and cousins)[14]. These many people (are good)[15]. Here me out loud, I am not opposed to the concept of girlfriend, but (marriage)[16], and (making a life long commitment)[17], so that the (girl feels secure with half of your earnings at divorce)[18], Sorry! Not my cup of milk!

"Good enough" could mean that the amount of entertainment and feeling of satisfaction you get from them in your free time is enough for you to not search for something more. If it had been a salt-less plate of biriyani, you would not have said the same.

I see lots of failed scenarios regarding marriage.

> Definition: checks out I think!

This is a predicate based on his beliefs about what is right and wrong, not on empirical examples. "Crime does not pay" is a predicate about the world and it would be false if the average crime led to a lot of money without imprisonment. "Crime **should** not pay" can be skipped for now. ("The Holy B says that crime should not pay" is testable, though.)

Good job! If you failed here, you can note down this pattern "X prefers A to B", so that you can focus on it in the future and stop making that mistake. Just like you would focus on two-digit multiplication if that's where you have failed in the past. For example, "a certain Agent prefers not marrying to marrying or not having kids to having kids".

"But I don't have any examples of the case where the aforementioned Agent has kids!" -- Ask the people selling this to you for smaller claims that you can test right now, such as "you will like holding a baby" or "changing a diaper ain't all that bad" or "people don't get too upset when their kids disobey them".

Nice. If this took you time, note down the pattern "doing more of X will help" so that you can search for similar scenarios on which to practice.

> Not sure if something is a running example (atleast 8/133 claims)

Are you using the same example for the same subject? For example, PG might claim many things about schleps (subject), such as most people don't take it on and it can be quite valuable. Did you use the same example of Stripe (running example)?

> Hard to give example, more time more research needed? (39/133 claims)

Mark the claim as lacking an example. Unless it's something you care about a lot, you don't need to spend too much time searching for an example (like the case of prison labor stats).

Overall, I didn't see you take on Superintelligence, which was the mission. Please work on either that or stuff you feel confused about. Only failures matter (apart from maintenance of existing performance).

Note down patterns of failure, such as "X prefers A to B". Spend, say, half your time searching for and practicing on examples of those types. You can spend the rest of your practice time on new examples, from which you will hopefully find other patterns of failure.

Best,
