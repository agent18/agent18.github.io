#### Story so far

In [Story so far][story_1] we discussed about how we have conflicting views. One time we want to save people, another time we don't. Our feelings change a lot for the same thing based on time. We further realized that our feelings are inconsistent and that we have circular preferences. It appears that it is quite unclear what we truly want, because there seems to be lot of changes with feelings on the same topic at different times. Looking at people dying makes us cry. We want to do something, but then too bad I have to go on a vacation. If we leave it up to feelings then I am going on a vacation, that is important to me right now. But I will also feel bad for those people who are dying, but then thats that. Our Value system is masked by heuristics and biases. Our heuristics and biases, are our the metaphorical eyes through which we glimpse into our value system. Having seen some of the heuristics and biases and related examples, we understand that the output of the heuristics might not always be the right thing for us, irrespective of the value system.

In the [Story so far(2)][story_2], we realize that everything is a feeling. As much as we might want to frown upon them because they are not consistent/are circular, that is all we have as an indication of what we might want. Having understood that we have feelings and that these attempt to badly inform us what we want, we wonder what options we might have. We check if we can ask someone else, what we should be doing in life, and sadly we can't. We have a [solution inside our head][tj_solution] with which we check if an action seems okay or not. The gap between accepting an action as ok and doing it seems large. For example, you can agree(based on the solution inside your head) that people are dying and that you need to save them, but you end up doing squat. Make no mistake, we only partially know what our true solution inside our head is. We are yet to uncover it fully(!).

Alas we stumble via [Eliezer's words][ele_intuitions] that you can't give up on feelings. That is the only thing we have. If you give up feelings by not trusting it at all, then you are but an empty philosopher who is but a rock. If you follow feelings to the letter, you are met with circular preferences. Paraphrasing Eliezer, "Feeling is not a curse word when it comes to morality, cause there is nothing else to argue from. Considering the way we have been made, it seems like a good idea to formalize, reflect on, extrapolate out to see if an idea has sensible consequences etcetera."

We briefly attempt to understand how important life is to us. We deduce that 'we want to save lives' and not let go of lives, based on how we emote. We also explore parts where in we see that location, distance, visibility shall not really matter whether we want to save a life or not.

In this weeks episode...

#### The importance of life

I feel like I am going to have to assume that life is very important to us as evidenced by how strong our feelings are. But how important is it? what all should we be ready to give up for it? How I can determine from my faulty feelings what exactly is the way to go, I am not sure. In other words, what does my true value system want (but for now only with respect to life)?

As discussed in earlier posts, 2 Israeli scientists, observed that people are willing to donate money for the costs of a very expensive treatment, more for an individual rather than for a group of 8. How can it be better to have 1 extra happy child in this world, while it might be somehow worse to have 8 more happy children? How can the value of one child be reduced to such an extent because there are 7 other children? In another study, The willingness to pay is the same whether we want to save 1k birds or 10k birds. Looking at this and the fact the brain never appears to understand large numbers we conclude that there is a high chance that the brain is blatantly making a mistake. We concluded earlier that this brain cannot but do arithmetic subconsciously. So now we are left with the option of understanding what the brain might want. But we don't know what exactly we should do.

Well Eleizer says that we need to 'shut up and multiply' the value we might get from saving one life. Use cold calculations and come to the answer. If one life is worth X, then 2 lives should be worth 2*X. Every life shall be worth the same, because there is no reason to discriminate one life from another. Unless of course there is "moral" reason to say that blacks are worth 0.5X (which there isn't), or that disabled men are worth much less than normal men, then essentially one life is worth X and n lives worth nX. But the brain does not scale feelings based on the number of lives saved. You don't understand the meaning of saving 1k lives or 10k lives. You don't feel much much happier having saved 10k lives.

The value of every successive life needn't be the same. It could very well be possible that the first life is more valuable than the second one; and so on, with every successive life we eventually plateau at large numbers of n. Isn't this what we observe in the 1k-10k-birds study? In real life though, if I see a person dying and I just saved him, I can't imagine scenario being any different when I see another person dying just after that. Looking at examples of natural disasters, I have seen videos over videos where people work round the clock, to save as many people as they can. This merely suggests that the total value gained is at a peak. It doesn't offer any information as to the value of successive lives. Nevertheless, people being saved has been maximized in each of the cases (where emotional arousal is high). Look at [this for example][story_i], where a doctor works round the clock to save people, goes out of the way to stay awake overnight and saves many many young helpless children.

It appears to me at this point that the information about value of each successive life is irrelavant. What is the action I hope to see when I see two people dying, or many people dying? I hope to see people running around to save as many lives as they can. That conclusion is important for me. I believe that I am justified in looking at the doctor in [this example][story_i] as our potential role in society. Feelings work only in certain scenarios. For example, when something happens around us, the emotional arousal is much higher, than in other cases.  We have seen earlier that the emotional arousal for an event happening in a closed sealed room is 0, as we don't see it. There are things that we would have emotional arousal to, and things that we wouldn't have emotional arousal to, despite the fact that both lead to the same outcome. Someone telling us that someone is dying 20 km away, and you seeing a video of someone dying 20km away, has different emotional arousal, while both are events of stoppable death of someone. Hence we look at the doctor to provide us data regarding our potential role in the society, by not looking in scenarios where in we know feelings will fail.

Picture this, several crying mothers - some having lost their babies, - panic stricken hospital workers not knowing what to do, the imminent danger of many more children loosing their lives, and the company supposed to deliver oxygen cylinders threatening to deliver oxygen cylinders only when the old dues are paid. There were many other doctors, in the same hospital, but only one had the balls while others gave up (according to the story atleast). There were many in the world, but it took Gandhi to change the scenario in India, while the Britishers were immorally ruling over India. Basically, shouldn't emotional arousal be the same for everybody, who was in the situation? Why didn't everyone in the scenario act? I am afraid of naively analyzing the situation but anyways here goes.

There are always others in the same scenario, why didn't they act? We look at a scenario where in there is high emotional arousal, and then we see that not everyone with that arousal does that. In fact very few people act on it as observed in the doctors case as well as with getting indepence from britain rule for India, by Gandhi. Firstly, feeling and action are slightly two different things. Also, Capability, belief in oneself, leadership could be one thing that differentiates one from the other. Road to action, takes something more than feelings. The entire world reacts to the article about the doctor. It says this is such an amazing thing. I can't imagine anyone in this world who condemns the action of the doctor. (!)

The situation with Gandhi seems to be that he was much more affected by the condition of the country, he traveled around the country to see reality, and he seemed to have the resolve necessary to fight evil.

The only question to myself is that I am afraid if I present this to a committee they are probably going to laugh at my reasoning which is purely based on coming up with excuses to support an outcome.

And could there be a case when one life is worth more than the other? For example, we have this innate thing I think, where we think that saving a child and mother is much more important, dating back to the days when this heuristic made sense (stone age).(!) But for now, for the sake of simplicity, we are going to keep the variables at a minimum. We are not going to consider this. In conclusion, Emotional arousal in simple cases that requires minimum calculation shows us what we might want against other things that we might seemingly want. Life is really valuable.

**Everything is a feeling. Feelings are limited in their application. We know feelings make mistakes in some cases, especially those involving calculations, as a result of using hueristics and biases. So we avoid those cases completely. So we take simple examples, with the belief of avoiding errors due to hueristics, in the hope that it represents our true value system. We hope to uncover more of it, one simple problem at a time.**

#### **Utility function**

So maybe, one life is worth X and n lives are worth nX. Now some other event maybe worth Y and m times that might be worth mY. We know we can't necessarily trust the brain with all sorts of calculations. But then the brain can point to what we might want in life. Maybe we can take an isolated incident and run in our minds and determine its possible value. Then we check it against actions in the world. So it maybe possible to know if X>Y or Y>X. It may also be possible to determine its value say using money. I am sure I can come up with something other than the value of life that is worth to me say Y. m*Y can be greater than X (saving one life), where m can be sufficiently large. What happens in this case? What if Y is something as silly as having sex.

It appears that the brain might have a utility function that needs to be maximized as much as possible with the available resources.
Are we trying to maximize only happiness? No. We are ready to give up sex, food and money, sometimes, and we might also be ready to take some pain to save someone. Remember the movie Gandhi? He gave up everything and led a simple life. There was only one thing that was important to him. He was jailed, he often starved, he went through a wide amount of discomfort. People hit him, beat him, but yet he seemed to be still going in the direction that mattered. He was trying to maximize something. Perhaps the welfare of his folk? But Why? Is it more important to him than his life, health etc.? He also had many 100's of followers atleast, who accompanied him on his way to be beaten and jailed. What were they trying to maximize?

So maybe, one life is worth X and n lives are worth nX. Now some other event maybe worth Y and m times that might be worth mY. We know we can't necessarily trust the brain with all sorts of calculations. But then the brain can point to what we might want in life. Maybe we can take an isolated incident and run in our minds and determine its possible value. Then we check it against actions in the world. So it maybe possible to know if X>Y or Y>X.

We are able to make choices. For example, when we are in a situation where we have to save a life or continue having sex, we would happily choose to save the life. So we are able to make choices, and tradeoffs. Naively speaking, So it seems like Event Y (sex) is less favorable that event X(saving a life). In other words, value from Event X > Value from Event Y.

Is it then alright to say that it appears that there is a utility function such that:

	$ Utility function = a1 *X + a2 *Y +a3 *Z + ...

Where in at any given point of time in life, you can do a couple of things, which will maximize the Overall utility. So when we save a life, our utility function becomes quite high as compared to having sex at a given moment. Maybe it is much more complex than this, but for now, lets go on with this simple model.

For now we call this the utility function, a function with all sorts of variables, which outputs a single number for us to know how our actions have faired. And yes you guessed it right, we have to uncover what is important to this utility function as well. Which variable is scaled high etc...

The utility function for example can be made of variables such as 'number of happy life years added', 'contribution back to the society', 'number of lives saved now', 'number of lives saved in the future' but as always we have to discover it, uncover it.
How do I go about determining what is important to this system?(!)

#### **Further options**

All the above is fine. I have a strong want to satisfy my value system. I have feelings which are part of me which attempt to satisfy the value system. But then they only attempt, and are far from satisfying the true value system.

There is this idea inside me that there are three things I can possibly do.
1) Follow the true value system, and get benefited as a by-product by the [evidence][martin_ted] shown by Martin Seligman on 'life of flow' and 'life of purpose'.

It's going to be hard. It will probably involve a lot of writing, and critical thinking and most importantly ACTION leading to impact.

2) Do what I am currently doing, like everyone else, continue to have those circular preferences, focus on the pleasurable life i.e., girls, video games, buying stuff etc. Learn an instrument and a sport and really be good at it and enjoy the life of flow. There is [undeniable evidence][martin_ted] where in Martin Seligman shows that the pleasurable life can only take you so far and that the life of flow will take you further. So have a mix of both?

This is what seems to come naturally to me. It's much easier than option 1. It's a mixture of pure feelings and some thought.

3) Don't do anything, just die off, because this whole life doesn't make sense. Why are you listening to some random stupid value system in the first place, especially considering that it just happened somehow that we have values?

There is just no point in life. Why are we trying to maximize the value system of some random event(evolution). Who cares? Look at this whole life system from the higher point of view. It seems to have no meaning. Just like how we look at ants. Absolutely purposeless, is their existence. Why are we any different? Just like ants, we also do so many things to fulfill our value system.
