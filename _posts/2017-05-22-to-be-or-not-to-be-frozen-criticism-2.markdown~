##### **Brief recap of cryonics**
[Cryonics][ci-cryonics] is the technology where in people are frozen immediately in liquid N2 after being declared dead, in the hopes of giving future science the best chance to revive us. It can be about replacing damaged tissues to organs, to reconstructing your entire brain and simulating it and so on, such that life after revival is [worth living enough][break-cryonics-down]. It is estimated that there is a [5% chance that Cryonics will succeed][tb-prolty]. 

A human being can sign up for cryonics using his life insurance and so on. It is the belief that the money you pay when compounded [will pay for your revival][alcor-faq]. There are other possibilities as well, like someone wealthy pays for your revival.

From the assumption that our value system cannot tolerate death, we infer that cryonics might seem useful to us in that it can save lives. Active action/inaction leading to the final death of an individual is not alright!

#### **Criticism**
I just googled "Criticism cryonics" and another article popped up. This article is titled ["The False Science of Cryonics"]. Recently I observe that it is very hard to obtain the truth. You can see many articles, but how do you know what is the truth in it?

Primarily the accusation is that people are falsely being sucked into cryonics which is a scam as it has no chance of working. This is followed by a some biology here and there. This part I cannot make complete sense of, as it requires a lot of reading and understanding. But my point stays that we are talking about an advanced civilization, say for example, a couple of centuries from now.

> But The freezing process might damage the cell structure!

Ditto as previous, we do what we think is the best chance for future generations to revive us (currently a 5% chance). 

#### **SIM life**
One of the possibilities of revival seems to be being a simulation. Robin Hanson talks about it [here][break-cryonics-down]. It is not clear how this simulation exists. Is it going to be a robot or just a simulation running online in a server, in non-living things etc... But it is believed that this life will be [worth living enough][break-cryonics-down]. 

The question raised by the author is will this sim be "you"? Will the sim have consciousness? The author further adds some more confusing but seemingly meaningful sentences together. 

I am not here to debate on the meaning of "YOU". Or for that matter try to answer vague definition based questions like, "When are YOU not YOU anymore.

Having read the comments here is my answer to the [article][mit-cryonics]: **You** is as a result of atoms and their configuration in a particular manner, and we don't suppose there is a ghost(soul) hiding in there somewhere influencing things. If that is the case, assuming great science and a kick ass future-advanced-civilization to help us, it should be possible to create even multiple instances of "you" - the configuration. But I suppose one will do, to keep "me" alive. 

Teleportation seems acceptable to us. So should this. Both the cases have a clear discontinuity in consciousness. What is stopping you from accepting the new YOU, be it teleported-new-YOU or sim-new-YOU!

#### Open Issues
0) There could be several other technologies why push for cryonics?

1) How does he determine the probabilities of each of the events. Some people estimate different probabilities. Whom to trust? Based on what?

2) The math is highly unclear, regarding calculating the present value of a life year after we have revived. 

3) How many life years or how many people can one save with the same money one spends on cryonics. Why is it the best use of money?

4) Is this type of technology only going to be available to the wealthy?

5) Why would the future generation invest in reviving a only a few people?

6) what to do after being revived?

7) Cryonics is a scam! reading and writing about this [article][cryonics-scam]

8) handling parents and familia? Not allowing them to grieve
