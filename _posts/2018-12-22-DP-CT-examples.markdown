## Introduction
 
The book `Talent is Overrated` explains that Talent is not something
that you are born with but something that is harnessed over years and
years of Deliberate Practice (DP). [This link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMcdhCR9Ubw) shows a person
learning guitar and counting the number of hours he worked on it as he
progresses. This is how it is expected to look. The more hours of DP
the more skilled you get. 

DP in general is expected to look like,

> Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
> examining. It is activity designed specifically to improve
> performance, often with a teacher’s help; it can be repeated a lot;
> feedback on results is continuously available; it’s highly demanding
> mentally, whether the activity is purely intellectual, such as chess
> or business-related activities, or heavily physical, such as sports;
> and it isn’t much fun.
>
> --- Chapter 7, Talent Is Overrated

Based on the above, in the last [essay on DP](/Deliberate-Practice-case-study.html), it was attempted to
DP based on the Benjamin Franklin (BF) method across 10 output
dimensions (very similar to the [attempt by an STM](http://pradeep90.github.io/ben-franklin-practice.html)). The skill
that was aimed to be improved was 'critical thinking'. In that context
different output dimensions such as 'number of ideas serially
delivered', 'concrete examples for each idea', 'continuity of
sentences and 5 others, were used. Usually, in DP a particular aspect
is practiced, with large repetition, where feedback on the results is
available immediately. For example, in one of the practices of Tiger
Woods, he stuffed balls in sand and practiced only hitting them one
after the other several times, measuring key dimensions like
distance of the ball traveled. What Tiger Woods doesn't seem to have
done is practice one ball in the sand, focus on his grip on the next,
one ball on the grass, focus on his posture in the next, and randomly
switch between each of them. Similarly, in an attempt to keep the focus on
the one skill or one isolated part of the skill that we want to
improve currently, we aim to look at one output dimension alone (as
suggested in the Mission). We look at the dimension which looks at the
concrete examples given. More on the actual dimension later.

In this essay we apply the same BF method across this one
dimension. For the BF method a base article is used, notes are made, a
few days later a new version written based on the notes. Finally the
original is compared with the new version across certain output
dimensions. The article chosen is [The Solution In Your Head](http://pradeep90.github.io/The-Solution-in-your-Head.html)
(SIYH).


## My Notes on SIYH

- what is the purpose of life?
- What do we want? What are we searching for?
- What would the solution look like?
- We care about impact not definitions

- gift-wrapped box what happens?
- solution cannot be 42
- what else could the solution be
- what happens when you get the solution? what do you do?

- looks like the solution can't just be anything!
- what are the constraints imposed?

- will the real slim shady please stand up
- Someone else is the making the final call about the solution, Who? or
  what?
  - NINRTS
- solution is inside your head?
- will use and should use solution

- solution needs to agree with SIYH
- some basic parts are somehow already in your head and you can't
  change that
- judging with the SIYH

- the box is useless if SIYH is fixed.
- but we seem to have changed our view on what should be part of SIYH.
- SIYH has changed or our understanding of the SIYH has changed
- map vs territory

- summary
- YOU and the SIYH are the same!
- more open questions is it happening inside our head? is it real?

## My Version

What is the purpose of life? What do we want in life? What should we
be doing? Should we go behind girls and making lot of money, or should
we excel at work and give everything that we have to the people in
need. The answer to these questions is an important one and has the
potential to completely change the way we live our lives. We call this
answer the Solution. Right now we don't seem to know the Solution, so
we decide to look around. Who has the answers? Where do we find this
Solution?

Let's say that someone hands us a gift-wrapped box with the "Solution"
inside. All we need to do is open it and perform it. What do we do?

### Personality of the solution

There could be doubts about the credibility of the Solution being
delivered. Let's assume it is the most trustworthy Solution ever. It
is hand-delivered by Albert Einstein or someone you respect the most,
after several 100 years of research, it cannot get any more credible
than this. Furthermore, the solution should be usable. If you open the
box and the box says "42", what are you going to be able to do with
that?  On the other hand if you open the box and it says, "Just follow
your feelings, to best fulfill the purpose of life", then it is
atleast usable.

So let's say we get such a credible, and usable Solution. Let's say
the Solution is something like, "Kill all babies in the world with a
knife", or something much less hair-raising or diabolical like, "slap
your Parents every time you see them", or maybe even something
seemingly pointless as "go up and down the stairs until the end of
time", What happens when you get this solution? What do you do? Every
solution, although usable and perform-able, we know we will never be
able to do it. We could imagine ways in which each of the solutions
proposed above might make sense, but we will never do it. For
instance, killing all the babies in the world could create fear in
people not to have any more children and thus prevent all of the human
race from causing more damage to the world. Far-fetched, but yeah we
can think of some scenario where it might make sense, but we are never
going to perform any of the solutions. The solution can't just be
anything.

In addition to the solution being credible and usable, there seems to
be additional constraints. The solution shall not contain any killing,
beating, slavery, suicides, loneliness etc... I seem to be able come up
with these constraints by myself. If Richard Feynman delivered a box
containing solutions violating the above constraints then I will not
be able to perform it. On the other hand if Richard Feynman delivered
a box saying, I should go behind girls, increase my status, gain more
power, make a lot of friends, I would pretty much say, "Your wish is
my command, Professor".


### Will the real slim shady please stand up

I seem to be judging every solution somehow with some pre-existing
knowledge from somewhere. The constraints seem to be coming from
within. No matter what solution you see, you are going to judge it and
will be able to perform it based on if it agrees with the SOLUTION
INSIDE YOUR HEAD (SIYH). The SIYH seems to be this set of rules that
you already posses to guide you in what is right and wrong.

Ah so you have the solution inside your head! Game over? Does this
mean you know what to do in your life? Well, in the beginning we
didn't know what the fuck to do with our lives. We were unable to
choose between "going behind girls" and "dedicating life to save as
many people as you can". We are still at "What the hell are we
supposed to do in life?" Nice that the solution is within, but the
story seems to be far from over.

### SIYH is fixed?

Although the SIYH is within the head we still don't know what to
do. Just looking inside seems to be not enough. So we continue to look
outside for gift-wrapped boxes to get more clues. Granted that we are
only able to look at these boxes through the SIYH, but we have no
other option. If the SIYH is fixed---cannot be modified---then there
is no point of looking outside. If no matter what happens we will
still have the same understanding of the SIYH, then the gift box is
worthless. But there used to be a time when I thought being Gay was
blasphemous. There used to be a time when I thought Vaishnavism
(religion) was the way to live life, there used to be a time when I
thought life was about getting girls and rising in status. And now I
seem to have some completely different views. What happened?

The SIYH seems to have been modified! Someone (an STM) came to me with
a gift-wrapped box, which said, "Gays are also people just like
us. What they do in the bedroom is none of your business. If they are
attracted to men, so be it. Who said men should be attracted to women
only. You seem to be echoing the popular opinion amongst the society
you grew up in. Just because 1 billion people think something is true,
does not make it true". Almost magically, my SIYH started changing it
self. The SIYH was used to modify itself. It seems like the SIYH can
be modified as long as it is within the current rules of the SIYH. The
SIYH used its rule of logic to modify itself.

### Map vs territory

The SIYH can be thought of as being modified or it can be thought that
the true SIYH is being uncovered more and more. Just like in ancient
days where people made rough maps of the actual terrain, and updated
it with more information as they explored it; we seem to be doing the
same thing. We initially have a rough map (SIYH), with some mountains
and rivers drawn not to scale (sex is good, killing is bad, Gays are
not welcome in the society etc...). We use that map to get some water
from the river (Hating on Gays according to the SIYH) and find some
inconsistencies in the Map (when someone delivered the gift-wrapped
box). Naturally you updated your Map, so that you can find the water
correctly next time, so that it is closer to the actual territory (the
TRUE SIYH).

## Output dimensions

So now that we have the main essay and our version of it, we need
output dimensions to compare. The following are the dimensions chosen.

**Rule #1** : Main ideas that are part of the essay, must be
identified. No grade is given for this rule. It just facilitates other
rules.

**Rule #2** : The main ideas shall each have one example atleast.

**Rule #3** : In my version of the essay, all places worthy of examples
shall have examples.

This is a quite vague, I accept, but if you have a look at the mission
and its examples, it is much less vague.

> For example, instead of "You run scenarios in your mind where you
> are verbally battling with them", you would give an example of a
> "verbal battle". Or, when we see "The book ‘Talent is Overrated’
> seems to suggest that greatness is not only for a select few.", we
> should also know what "greatness" looks like and who those "select

> a concrete example for this bold claim (maybe a video like
> this). And, finally, "The journey will be hard, long and
> demanding." - like how hard, how long, and how demanding?
>
> --- from the Mission

**Rule #4** : Rule #3 but for STM's essay instead.

**Rule #5** : Should not have missed any critical points as compared to an
STM's essay.

## Comparing

**Part I**

STM:

> Entry question: What is the purpose of life?
>
> Setting it up In “The Big Problems”, I started talking about the
> biggest obstacles on our path to getting what we want. What I left
> out there was the most important issue - what do we really want?
>
> What is it that we’re searching for? What is the “purpose of our
> Life”? Is there any “meaning to Life”?
>
> We’ll answer all these questions and more.


ME:

> What is the purpose of life? What do we want in life? What should we
> be doing? Should we go behind girls and making lot of money, or
> should we excel at work and give everything that we have to the
> people in need. The answer to these questions is an important one

> know the Solution, so we decide to look around. Who has the answers?
> Where do we find this Solution?


Rule #1: The main idea discussed here by me as well as an STM, is the
`lack of knowledge about what we need to do in life`.

Rule #2: I have given an example to emphasize the main idea discussed.

> Should we go behind girls and making lot of money, or
> should we excel at work and give everything that we have to the
> people in need.

It doesn't look like an STM has done that. 

0-1 for Agent!

Rule #3: It appears that I should have given some examples to support the
following sentence:

> The answer to these questions is an important one and has the
> potential to completely change the way we live our lives.

I think it should be expanded to the following, containing examples.

"The answer to these questions is important owing to the limited time
we have on this planet. If the answer to this question is about
getting better at say critical thinking, then the sooner we start the
better. This solution thus has the potential to change our lives
drastically. As focusing on girls, would mean to work on skills like
'picking up', magic and the like, where as wanting to be altruistic
needs you to be extremely good at things that make money or saves
large number of people."

2-0 for STM

Rule #4: I don't think an STM needed to give any more examples except
for the ones mentioned in Rule #2.

0-0


Rule #5: Looks like we both covered the same thing.

0-0

In total : 2-1 for STM

**Part II**

STM:

> The necessary first step
> Let’s look at the problem in more detail
> (long long time since I’ve been saying this).
>
> What would the Solution look like? If I said there was someone
> behind the door who had the Solution, what would you guess about the
> nature of the Solution, without knowing anything in particular about
> that person?
>
> Ground rule: We talk only in terms of… words? dictionary
> definitions? references to philosophers? Nah! Only Impact.

> Ok, assume I have a gift-wrapped Box with me. In it lies the answer
> to all the questions you’ve been asking about goals and purposes and
> meaning and stuff.



ME:

> Let's say that someone hands us a gift-wrapped box with the
> "Solution" inside. All we need to do is open it and perform it. What
> do we do?

Rule #1: The main idea discussed here by me is the `introduction of the
gift-wrapped box`. An STM is also discussing the same.

Rule #2: I think a few examples of how the gift-wrapped box or the
Solution inside should look seems to be missing. Although they are
delivered in the next parts of the essay.

0-0 for both

In total: 1-1

**Part III**

STM:

> The essence of all your questions basically is - How should I live
> my life?
>
> We want something that will tell us what we should do at each point
> in life.
>
> Well, the Solution inside will tell you exactly how you should best
> live your life.
>
> I hand over the Box to you. You are free to open it after a minute.
>
> What happens now? What will the Impact be? Why do you want the
> answer? Why not just throw the Box away?

> Planning Ahead What will happen when we have the Solution?
>
> We may not know what the Solution will be, but we’re expecting
> something we can use, right? We don’t expect the “Solution” to be
> “42”. That doesn’t tell us anything. It is of no use to us.
>
> Remember what I’d written a long time ago, in the overconfident
> exuberance of my youth, about solving Hard problems?
>
> When you have banged your head about for what seems like forever and

>
> You should be confident that once you have the answers to these

>
> You should have figured out just about everything else.

ME:

Rule #1: Here I primarily write about 2 things, one is about the
`credibility of the solution` and the other is about the `usability of
the solution`. 

An STM seems to write about, `what the solution should contain`,
`usability of the solution` and ends with the assumption about the
`gift-wrapped box being the right one`.

Rule #2: I have given examples of what it means to be credible i.e.,
that the solution is coming from science or coming from one of the
greatest researchers of all time. I also give examples for what it
means that a solution is usable. I give examples for usable and
non-usable cases.

An STM, gives examples for what a usable solution should not look
like, but fails to provide an example of how a usable solution should
look like. Strike I think! An STM doesn't really talk about the
credibility of the solution the way I did, so I don't think he is
obliged to add any more examples.

1-2 for Agent.

Rule #3: There seem not to be other places that I need to give
examples for.

Rule #4: An STM talks about what the solution should inform, such as 

> We want something that will tell us what we should do at each point
> in life

> Well, the Solution inside will tell you exactly how you should best
> live your life.

I think he is missing atleast 2 examples.

0-2 for Agent!

Total: 1-4 for Agent!

Rule #1: The main idea of this part is to `show that the Solution
can't just be anything`. An STM and I seem to be talking about the
same thing.

Rule #2: Both STM and I have given decent number of examples about the type
of unacceptable solutions which reflects the main idea.

1-1 

Rule #3: There don't seem to be any places missing examples.

Rule #4: There don't seem to be any places missing examples.

Rule #5: STM also brings in a nice point that I missed.

> And yet, every one of them is laughably wrong. There is just no way
> any of them is the real answer!
>
> But how could you know that?!
>
> You don’t know the real answer to the question. You could be

STM talks about how we could be wrong and yet we don't accept THE
SOLUTION. We have been wrong in the past haven't we (The Earth is
Flat!!!). 

1-0 for an STM.

In total: 2-1 for STM.

Rule #1: `SIYH` and `What does it mean for the initial questions
asked` are the main points discussed here. An STM talks mainly about
`SIYH`.

Rule #2: I have not delivered even one example, for `the SIYH` whereas
an STM has delivered examples. It seems like I just delivered examples
in the previous paragraph about this. But when I am reading it, it
still feels like I need a solid example here. Either I should re-write
to accommodate the examples here or I should re-write the paragraphs
to feel like it is not repetitive. But I didn't so, Strike!

1-0 for an STM

Rule #5: I like how an STM contrasts the *'Should do'* solution with
the *'Will do'* solution. You *SHOULD* perform the Solution in the Box
and you *WILL* perform it only if it is in accordance with the SIYH. I
missed this part here.

1-0 for an STM

Rule #1: `SIYH can be modified`, `Map vs territory connection` are the
2 main ideas I am focusing on in the above paragraphs. An STM focuses
on `how our view is colored forever`, `SIYH can be modified` and the
`Map vs Territory connection`.

Rule #2: I seem to have provided examples for the main points in 'Rule
#1' using 'how our view about Gays has changed over time' as the main
example. An STM has given proper examples for all the main points as
well.

1-1

Rule #3: When writing about the Map and Territory connection, I
purposely skipped providing an example in the end as I couldn't come
up with it at that time. Strike for me!

> ... find some inconsistencies in the Map (when someone
> delivered the gift-wrapped box). Naturally you updated your Map, so
> that you can find the water correctly next time, so that it is

I said, "the TRUE SIYH", instead it should have been, "Gays are also
people like us and very much welcome everywhere, just as Straight
people are"

1-0 for STM

Rule #5: A closing statement on what it means for us is missing in my
version. Also I think what is missing in my text is, we are yet to
discover a ton more of the map and over throw many of our beliefs. An
STM very well featured it as shown below:

> There are vast parts unmarked (“how to treat women, blacks, gays,
> etc.”). Then, as we gain more and more knowledge, we fill in the
> vaguer parts of the map (“Ah! Black people are basically just like
> me. It is wrong to treat them like slaves”).

## Reflection

### Scores
	
The scores seem to indicate that an STM on average has done better
than me. Lot of space to improve.

Rule #1 was not scored as it was expected to only assist Rule #2.

Rule #2 was expected to be the rule that allowed to see if I have
examples for the main points determined in Rule #1. It appears that in
a few places (2 out of 6 parts) I have defaulted on this rule; and an
STM has defaulted as well (3 out of 6 times). According to me, it
appears that the places where I missed is not really a big deal, as I
had delivered the examples in the passages just before and after. In
one case ('Part II') I had not given examples of the gift-wrapped box,
but they show up in the subsequent paragraphs. In the other case where
I missed ('Part V'), I just gave an example in the last paragraph, and
didn't want the paragraph to sound repetitive. I don't want to come
across as being cocky, I just want to clarify how I feel. The reader
shall correct me appropriately.

Rule #3 was about the places other than the main points where I *feel*
like I missed giving an explanation, based on the examples in the
mission:

> "The book ‘Talent is Overrated’ seems to suggest that greatness is
> not only for a select few.", we should also know what "greatness"
> looks like and who those "select few" were who we wrongly assumed to
> be sole possessors of talent.

I missed 2 out of 6 parts. Whereas an STM missed 1 out of 6 parts
(Rule #4). I admit I don't know if in some places examples are
required even. It just *feels* right, so I try to penalize myself so
that I can get feedback from a reader later. As an illustration, in
Part 1 Rule #3, it felt like I had to clarify what the hell I was
saying, with an example here,

> The answer to these questions is an important one and has the
> potential to completely change the way we live our lives.

"Important" why? "potential to completely change the way we live" why?

Rule #5 was just there to help me realize when I miss some *valid*
points from making. When I realize it I make a note. I didn't try to
go out of my way to find faults. I seem to have defaulted 2 out of 6
Parts even then.

Overall, there is a lot of scope for improvement. If I want to improve
this, I need to do more such exercises and compare over time how I
fare. Nowadays, I find my inner voice aiding me to write examples, by
sometimes spotting the need for examples automatically, and even if I
am lazy, pushing me to write them. I guess this is how DP provides
results. For example today when I was writing the introduction, there
was a point when I was discussing 'working with one dimension at a
time'. I managed to deliver an example involving 'Tiger Woods playing
only the sand-balls as DP'. Also looking at old articles would help to
see the growth before DP and afer DP.

### Impact
<!-- impact -->

The bigger point that an STM is trying to push me towards is I think
that words mean shit. Without examples you are nothing. When someone
says "You need to be great". WTF does it even mean? What do I need to
do? Where do I go? How to I train? In what do I train? etc...

We deliver examples to allow us to see where we are failing. If you
remember Mission #2, it gets clear. We cannot work with words.

I am failing at work Viz., I suck at organizing information and
providing actions based out of it in a convincing way to my Boss at
work. Close enough, but an actual link to the PowerPoint I am
referring to would help I guess. As said before, my antennas are
moderately on alert now, to deliver examples and not just deliver
words. I guess with more exercises I can hopefully see more change and
naturally have the tendency to drop examples like dropping bombs in
the middle east (without thought or hesitation) as and where needed,
and reach a state of unconscious consistency over time.

**Note:** A word about Unconscious consistency (UC). UC is not where
we want to be in most skills, as it seems to stop growth in that skill
(Chapter 5, Talent is Overrated). Think about driving, where in the
beginning you struggle to put all the knowledge and actions together,
then you slowly start getting a grip of the whole thing and within
some time, you are talking on the phone and driving almost
automatically. And our improvement slows down dramatically from there
onward. But that is okay, we just want to be able to drive safely and
move around conveniently. For most things that is not a problem. In
the case of determining where to drop examples that is all I want I
guess.

In other cases though, say when you are organizing information and
providing solutions---based on that---to your boss, you might want to be
like Tiger Woods, conscious, controlled and not automatic.

because of the shadow of a bird flying behind him. Here is [him

### Not that hard

Overall it didn't feel like I was on the edge, like the last time when
I did this assignment. I was literally racing to finish, there was so
much to do and I couldn't afford any sorts of distractions. This time,
I am quite relaxed as I am finishing this assignment over the final
4-8 hrs of the assignment. Why is this not hard, why is it
boringish---whether it is comparing the original and my version or
writing my own version of the essay?

Hypothesis: It is because we measured lesser dimensions at a time so lesser
words, lesser work, lesser time required for work. But then I
allocated more time in total.

Observation: Not hard enough, not on the edge of the seat, lot of distraction
this time, thinking about random things when I was supposed to be
clocking DP hours.

Observation: Didn't have to do much of planning as I was confident of
finishing the assignment anyway. Whereas the last time I remember
giving half an hour for one part and forcing myself to meet the time
constraints.

Observation: Lower Words/hr written in SIYH compared to RorG! Lower
total words written in SIYH compared to RorG! Implying that the time
allocated for DP'ing this time seems to be larger than required.

| Essay                         | Number of words | Time taken to write |
|:-----------------------------:|:---------------:|---------------------|
| SIYH my version (stm version) | 1114 (2600)     | 6.6 hrs             |
| RorG my version (stm version) | 595 (1400)      | 2.5 hrs             |
| SIYH (DP Essay)               | ~4800           | ~23 hrs             |
| RorG (DP essay)               | ~7100           | ~28 hrs             |
| SIYH (comparing)              |                 | ~6 hrs              |
| RorG (comparing)              |                 | >10 hrs                    |


**Conclusion and action:** It is clear that the number of words per
hour is much less in the case of this essay. To make it challenging
lesser time should have been allocated to complete the task with
lesser dimensions. If I use the Words/hr of the RorG DP essay, it
appears that I would need ~16 hrs to finish this SIYH DP essay, which
I spent 23 hrs on. Maybe that is somewhere to start. Next time I
either increase the content delivered or reduce the time to match with
RorG. We'll evaluate how the task is the next time and factor in other
variables of motivation if need be.

### Other issues

<!-- Stupid issues -->

From earlier it is already clear that the hardness of the task needs
to be factored in, and consciously accounted for. But I had some other
issues while writing this essay as well.

I have written my version and was in the process of comparing mine
with the original. For this I needed segments of the original and my
version, to match. The issue was 'Where do I put this paragraph, in
part X or part X+1?'

I would like to spend majority of the time on doing real comparisons
and not bothering about things like which paragraphs belong in which
part. I spent quite some time, stuck at places not sure if a paragraph
is supposed to be in this part or the next. I think this came about
because I was worried about getting too much help from the notes while
writing my version, I was even considering shuffling the order of the
notes just like BF did. Luckily I didn't, it would have been much
harder to match the paragraphs. BF shuffled his notes to allow himself
the opportunity to learn how to organize his texts well. I don't think
that is the skill I am working on right now. I should be completely
focused on finding where I am missing examples and dropping them. That
is it!

I want to suggest that I make *notes per section of the original
essay* or per set of paragraphs and clearly demarcate them while
making notes. This way while making my version, I will make it based
on the demarcations in the notes. This way I suppose I don't have any
paragraph overlapping between 2 parts. And regarding making it too
easy for me or being able to recollect from the original essay, I
think I should wait a few days before re-writing from the notes.

<!-- ### Being distracted -->

<!-- I think I am involved in drama and those are having the potential to -->
<!-- suck me in them, right from eating in a group and sorting out the -->
<!-- money issues and , to the girl whose texts I long for to the drama in -->
<!-- my occupational life, to the goddamning persuation caused by y indian -->
<!-- friend and his dutch gf. Do you hear it already? In addition to -->
<!-- boredom mentioned a few lines back this is something else that I need -->
<!-- to deal with. The last few days atleast, when I am not expecting -->
<!-- anything from her, I am much more peaceful. I am not anxious for -->
<!-- anything. Yes that is it, anxiety! Jesus fucking christ! -->

<!-- <\!-- why are examples quite important -\-> -->

### Road ahead

An STM always asks me in the Mission to provide clear plans and not be
vague. That has been the foundation.

> because of lack of "critical thinking" (why am I putting "critical
> thinking" in scare quotes?) and divide them into skills. No abstract
> skills like "logical structure" or "critical thinking". Concrete
> instances where you failed. That will give you harsh feedback

So I try. I don't want to be like, "I have to do many more essays" and
leave it at that. I think it is a way for me to escape from thinking
what I actually need to be doing next.

I am unsure how I should take this forward. Yes, I would like to do a
few more essays just like this one with the above format and output
dimensions. But, I am not sure where this is going. I am not sure what
I am solving or where this is going to help.

When I practice basketball every Saturday, I am not looking for
anything more than killing it on the game with friends on next day. I
know where I suck in the game and simply focus on getting better in
those particular situations with high repetition. Over time I want to
be really good, that people turn their heads, and hope to keep playing
this sport well into old age. It is one place where I can stand long
duration's of cardio without batting an eye. So I like how it is going
on. But in the case of "critical thinking", I don't know how my
current work is going to help me?

What is the high-level skill I am working on? Is it "critical
thinking"? What will this do for me? Where can I expect to see these
results? If I don't know about this, then I think I am as clueless as
the x-girlfriend of Andrew (from Whiplash) (Writing-Rule#8
trying-too-hard;)).

Will the real slim shady please stand up? I think I need to either
revisit or redo, Mission #2, and make the connection.
