## Introduction

In the last [essay on Deliberate Practice](/Deliberate-Practice-case-study.html), it was attempted to
Deliberate Practice based on the Benjamin Franklin method across 10
output dimensions. Different output dimensions such as `number of
ideas serially delivered`, `concrete examples for each idea`,
`continuity of sentences` were used. 

The characteristics of DP are as follows:

> The kind of practice I described in this essay is designed to improve
> performance because it specifically aims to improve along one or two
> well-defined output dimensions

## What is DP and how does it look


## This episode

For this episode, we are going to look into an STMs article "The
Solution inside your head". As usual we will start with nothing but
the actual article, make notes, and then re-write my own version and
compare with the original over the output dimension of "giving the
right examples"



## Actual article
[An STM's Article "The Solution in your Head"](http://pradeep90.github.io/The-Solution-in-your-Head.html)


## Pandian's Notes

- what is the purpose of life?
- What do we want? What are we searching for?
- What would the solution look like?
- We care about impact not definitions

- gift-wrapped box what happens?
- solution cannot be 42
- what else could the solution be
- what happens when you get the solution? what do you do?

- looks like the solution can't just be anything!
- what are the constraints imposed?

- will the real slim shady please stand up
- Somone else is the making the final call about the solution, Who? or
  what?
  - NINRTS
- solution is inside your head?
- will use and should use solution

- solution needs to aggree with SIYH
- some basic parts are somehow already in your head and you can't
  change that
- judging with the SIYH

- the box is useless if SIYH is fixed.
- but we seem to have changed our view on what should be part of SIYH.
- SIYH has changed or our understanding of the SIYH has changed
- map vs territory

- summary
- YOU and the SIYH are the same!
- more open questions is it happening inside our head? is it real?

should look at re-ordering it

## Pandian's Version

What is the purpose of life? What do we want in life? What should we
be doing? Should we go behind girls and making lot of money, or should
we excel at work and give everything that we have to the people in
need. The answer to these questions is an important one and has the
potential to completely change the way we live our lives. We call this
answer the Solution. Right now we don't seem to know the Solution, so
we decide to look around. Who has the answers? Where do we find this
Solution?

Let's say that someone hands us a gift-wrapped box with the "Solution"
inside. All we need to do is open it and perform it. What do we do?

### Personality of the solution

There could be doubts about the credibility of the Solution being
delivered. Let's assume it is the most trustworthy Solution ever. It
is hand-delivered by Albert Einstein or someone you respect the most,
after several 100 years of research, it cannot get any more credible
than this. Furthermore, the solution should be usable. If you open the
box and the box says "42", what are you going to be able to do with
that?  On the other hand if you open the box and it says, "Just follow
your feelings, to best fulfill the purpose of life", then it is
atleast usable.

So let's say we get such a credible, and usable Solution. Let's say
the Solution is something like, "Kill all babies in the world with a
knife", or something much less hair-raising or diabolical like, "slap
your Parents every time you see them", or maybe even something
seemingly pointless as "go up and down the stairs until the end of
time", What happens when you get this solution? What do you do? Every
solution, although usable and perform-able, we know we will never be
able to do it. We could imagine ways in which each of the solutions
proposed above might make sense, but we will never do it. For
instance, killing all the babies in the world could create fear in
people not to have any more children and thus prevent all of the human
race from causing more damage to the world. Far-fetched, but yeah we
can think of some scenario where it might make sense, but we are never
going to perform any of the solutions. The solution can't just be
anything.

In addition to the solution being credible and usable, there seems to
be additional constraints. The solution shall not contain any killing,
beating, slavery, suicides, lonliness etc... I seem to be able come up
with these constraints by myself. If Richard Feynman delivered a box
containing solutions violating the above constraints then I will not
be able to perform it. On the other hand if Richard Feynman delivered
a box saying, I should go behind girls, increase my status, gain more
power, make a lot of friends, I would pretty much say, "Your wish is
my command, Professor".


### Will the real slim shady please stand up

I seem to be judging every solution somehow with some pre-existing
knowledge from somewhere. The constraints seem to be coming from
within. No matter what solution you see, you are going to judge it and
will be able to perform it based on if it agrees with the SOLUTION
INSIDE YOUR HEAD (SIYH). The SIYH seems to be this set of rules that
you already posses to guide you in what is right and wrong.

Ah so you have the solution inside your head! Game over? Does this
mean you know what to do in your life? Well, in the beginning we
didn't know what the fuck to do with our lives. We were unable to
choose between "going behind girls" and "dedicating life to save as
many people as you can". We are still at "What the hell are we
supposed to do in life?" Nice that the solution is within, but the
story seems to be far from over.

### SIYH is fixed?

Although the SIYH is within the head we still don't know what to
do. Just looking inside seems to be not enough. So we continue to look
outside for gift-wrapped boxes to get more clues. Granted that we are
only able to look at these boxes through the SIYH, but we have no
other option. If the SIYH is fixed---cannot be modified---then there
is no point of looking outside. If no matter what happens we will
still have the same understanding of the SIYH, then the gift box is
worthless. But there used to be a time when I thought being Gay was
blasphemous. There used to be a time when I thought Vaishnavism
(religion) was the way to live life, there used to be a time when I
thought life was about getting girls and rising in status. And now I
seem to have some completely different views. What happened?

The SIYH seems to have been modified! Someone (an STM) came to me with
a gift-wrapped box, which said, "Gays are also people just like
us. What they do in the bedroom is none of your business. If they are
attracted to men, so be it. Who said men should be attracted to women
only. You seem to be echoing the popular opinion amongst the society
you grew up in. Just because 1 billion people think something is true,
does not make it true". Almost magically, my SIYH started changing it
self. The SIYH was used to modify itself. It seems like the SIYH can
be modified as long as it is within the current rules of the SIYH. The
SIYH used its rule of logic to modify itself.

### Map vs territory

The SIYH can be thought of as being modified or it can be thought that
the true SIYH is being uncovered more and more. Just like in ancient
days where people made rough maps of the actual terrain, and updated
it with more information as they explored it; we seem to be doing the
same thing. We initially have a rough map (SIYH), with some mountains
and rivers drawn not to scale (sex is good, killing is bad, Gays are
not welcome in the society etc...). We use that map to get some water
from the river (Hating on Gays according to the SIYH) and find some
inconsistencies in the Map (when someone delivered the gift-wrapped
box). Naturally you updated your Map, so that you can find the water
correctly next time, so that it is closer to the actual territory (the
TRUE SIYH).


## Output dimension

Rule #1 will be to identify the ideas.

Rule #2 is about examples corresponding to the main idea

Rule #3 looking at where all I could have given an example

Rule #4 Looking at where all an STM could have given example

Rule #5 missing something important?

Examples are expected to be provided for all words that are vague as
shown in the Mission section.

Rewriting with examples is an expected output of the this comparison!


Examples, now what the fucking hell does that mean. How to identify
such a dimension.

I also want to try and squeeze in one idea and one example, so also
Identifying.

But what an STM talked about is more like Rational tabooing with
example. How exactly this is done needs to be worked out.

Yeah so identify main ideas and make sure you have examples for the
main ideas atleast. In addition you get bonus points for explaining
about all the rationalist tabooed words. As that is what an STM was
talking about, right?

How about counting number of high-level descriptions? W

What classifies as high-level descriptions?

Identify ideas, count number of high-level descriptions or bold
claims, that do not have examples. We are talking about things like
"verbal battles", "greatness", "select few". Stretch it boye!

Rule #1: The main idea discussed here by me as well as an STM, is the
`lack of knowledge about what we need to do in life`.

Rule #2: I have given an example to emphasize the main idea discussed.

> Should we go behind girls and making lot of money, or
> should we excel at work and give everything that we have to the
> people in need.

It doesn't look like an STM has done that. 

0-1 for Agent!

Rule #3: 

It appears that I should have given some examples to support the
following sentence:

> The answer to these questions is an important one and has the
> potential to completely change the way we live our lives.

I think it should be expanded to the following containing examples.

"The answer to these questions is important owing to the limited time
we have on this planet. If the answer to this question is about
getting better at say critical thinking, then the sooner we start the
better. This solution thus has the potential to change our lives
drastically. As focusing on girls, would mean to work on skills like
'picking up', magic and the like, where as wanting to be altruistic
needs you to be extremely good at things that make money or saves
large number of people."

2-0 for STM

Rule #4: I don't think an STM needed to give any more examples except
for the one mentioned in Rule #2.

0-0


Rule #5: Looks like we both covered the same thing.

0-0

Rule #1: The main idea discussed here by me is the `introduction of the
gift-wrapped box`. An STM is also discussing the same.

Rule #2: I think a few examples of how the gift-wrapped box or the
Solution inside should look seems to be missing. Although they are
delivered in the next parts of the essay.

Rule #1: Here I primarily write about 2 things, one is about the
`credibility of the solution` and the other is about the `usability of
the solution`. 

An STM seems to write about, `what the solution should contain`,
`usability of the solution` and ends with the assumption about the
`gift-wrapped box being the right one`.

Rule #2: I have given examples of what it means to be credible i.e.,
that the solution is coming from science or coming from one of the
greatest researchers of all time. I also give examples for what it
means that a solution is usable. I give examples for usable and
non-usable solution.

An STM, gives examples for what a usable solution should not look
like, but fails to provide an example of usable solution. Strike! An
STM doesn't really talk about the credibility of the solution the way
I did, so I don't think he is obliged to add any more examples.

1-2 for Agent.

Rule #3:  There seem to be not other places that I need to give
examples for. 

Rule #4: 

An STM talks about what the solution should inform, such as 

> We want something that will tell us what we should do at each point
> in life

> Well, the Solution inside will tell you exactly how you should best
> live your life.

I think he is missing atleast 2 examples.

0-2 for Agent!

Total: 1-4 for Agent!

Rule #1: The main idea of this part is to `show that the Solution
can't just be anything`. An STM and I seem to be talking about the
same thing.

Rule #2: Both STM and I give decent number of examples about the type
of unacceptable solutions which reflects the main idea.

1-1 

Rule #3: There don't seem to be any places missing examples.

Rule #4: There don't seem to be any places missing examples.

Rule #5:

STM also brings in a nice point that I missed.

> And yet, every one of them is laughably wrong. There is just no way
> any of them is the real answer!
>
> But how could you know that?!
>

STM talks about how we could be wrong and yet we don't accept THE
SOLUTION. We have been wrong in the past haven't we (The Earth is
Flat!!!).  

1-0 for an STM.

In total: 2-0 for STM.

Rule #1:  `SIYH` and `What does it mean for the initial
questions asked`.  An STM talks mainly about `SIYH`.

Rule #2: I have not delivered even one example, for `the SIYH` whereas
an STM has delivered examples. It does appear for me that I just
delivered examples in the previous paragraph. But when I am reading
it, it still feels like I need a solid example here. Either I re-write
to accommodate the examples here or I re-write the paragraphs to feel
like it is not repetitive.

1-0 for an STM

Rule #5: I like how an STM contrasts the Should do solution with the
Will do solution. You should perform the Solution in the Box and you
Will perform only if it is in accordance with the SIYH. I missed this
part here.

1-0 for an STM

Total: 2-0 for an STM!

Rule #1: `SIYH can be modified`, `Map vs territory connection` are the
2 main ideas I am focusing on in the above paragraphs. An STM focuses
on `how our view is colored forever`, `SIYH can be modified` and the
`Map vs Territory connection`.

Rule #2: I seem to have provided examples for the main points in 'Rule
#1' using 'how our view about Gays has changed over time' as the main
example. An STM has given proper examples for all the main points as
well.

1-1

Rule #3: When writing about the Map and Territory connection, I
purposely skipped providing an example in the end as I couldn't come
up with it at that time. Strike for me!

> ... find some inconsistencies in the Map (when someone
> delivered the gift-wrapped box). Naturally you updated your Map, so

I said, "the TRUE SIYH", instead it should have been, "Gays are also
people like us and very much welcome everywhere, just as Straight
people are"

1-0 for STM

Rule #5: A closing statement on what it means for us is missing in my
text. Also I think what is missing in my text is, we are yet to
discover a ton more of the map and over throw many of our beliefs. An
STM very well featured it as shown below:

> There are vast parts unmarked (“how to treat women, blacks, gays,
> etc.”). Then, as we gain more and more knowledge, we fill in the
> vaguer parts of the map (“Ah! Black people are basically just like
> me. It is wrong to treat them like slaves”).

1-0 for STM

Total: 3-1 for STM

## Reflection

<!-- it didn't feel that hard --> 

Q: Overall it didn't feel like I was on the edge, like the last time when I
 did this assignment. Why?
 
Either it was not challenging enough, or there was too much delay in
feedback, or value of the assignment is shit! I suspect it was the
challenging part as I didn't change much in my way of work regarding
feedback or value of the assignment. 

O: lot of distraction this time, thinking about random things
when I was supposed to be clocking DP hours.

O: Lower Words/hr in SIYH rather than RorG!

O: I even spent more than twice the time on my version of STM's essay

| Essay                         | Number of words | Time taken to write |
|:-----------------------------:|:---------------:|---------------------|
| SIYH my version (stm version) | 1114 (2600)     | 6.6 hrs             |
| RorG my version (stm version) | 595 (1400)      | 2.5 hrs             |
| SIYH (DP Essay)               | ~4000           | ~22 hrs             |
| RorG (DP essay)               | ~7000           | ~28 hrs             |
| SIYH (comparing)              |                 | ~6 hrs              |
| RorG (comparing)              |                 | >10 hrs                    |


H: We measured lesser dimensions at a time so lesser words, lesser work

H: Easy to identify dimension having a lot of time.

**Conclusion and action:** It is clear that the number of words per hr
is much less in the case of this essay. To make it challenging lesser
time would be needed to complete the task with lesser dimensions.  If
I look at the Words/hr of the entire essay, it appears that I would
need ~16 hrs to finish the assignment. Maybe that is somewhere to
start.

We'll evaluate how the task is the next time and factor in other
variables of motivation if need be.

<!--
	What do the scores mean? -->
	
The scores seem to indicate that an STM on average has done better
than me. Lot of space to improve. I think am only now training my
ability to spot where 

I admit I don't know if in some places examples are required even. It
just *feels* right, so I penalize myself. (example) I do see with the
recent exercises and having seen what an STM has written, the need for
. I nowadays don't like to deliver just the text, I try to follow it
up with example, just like was done in this paragraph. I think I am
atleast able to see these things now.

The point of unconscious consistency is yet to come.

Rule #2 was expected to be the rule that allowed to see if I have
examples for the main points determined in Rule #1. It appears that in
a few places (2 out of 6 parts) I have defaulted on this rule and an
STM defaulted (3 out of 6 times). I am not sure of what the impact
is. I don't understand the point of this exercise in the first
place. According to me, it appears that the places where I missed is
not really a big deal, as I had delivered the examples in the passages
before and after. I was just trying to be critical.

As I said, I admit, sometimes it is hard to know if the rules I come
up with based off of STM's missions, is what is expected. Once I hear
the feedback I shall be back on my horse.

Rule #3 was about the places other than the main point where I feel
like I missed giving an explanation. Just like in the mission:

> "The book ‘Talent is Overrated’ seems to suggest that greatness is
> not only for a select few.", we should also know what "greatness"
> looks like and who those "select few" were who we wrongly assumed to
> be sole possessors of talent.

I found some places where I missed in 2 out of 6 parts. Where as an
STM missed in 1 out of 6. 

Judegement, I am not sure if I am applying the rules right! so I will
wait for feedback from an STM, and also apply it to other articles
that are superior and see how I fare.

The point is this should happen unconsciously.


<!-- What all would you do different? -->
<!-- Stupid issues -->

Where to put a paragrph in part 5 or part 6!

I would like to spend majority of the time on doing real comparisons

Maybe this can be avoided if I make notes per section of the essay and
reproduce it just like that, so that the content matches one to one
and can be checked. The reason I didn't do it is because I cared about
writing the own article with as little help as possible. I forgot the
goal is to generate examples, where ever needed. I was also afraid
adding too many clues is going to the notes and writing the essay
immediately, will result in ease of writing the examples as it is
fresh in my memory. BF did otherwise, he waited a few days before re-writing.

<!-- Being distracted -->

thinking about this asian, thinking about buying a phone,

Possibly because it was boring and the other thing is that it could
have been beacause I was involved in some stupid social games where I
took the bait! 

<!-- why are examples quite important -->

<!-- Road ahead -->

I want to reflect on this whole critical thinking thing. What are
examples where I fail, and see if what I am doing makes sense and
reform it by practicing it with many more essays of high quality.

## TODO

spell check, read the whole thing again! add reflection and if time
permits have a look at the content by 
P.S

Arranging the different parts together was the problem! What do you
think I should do?


Look at what Eliezer or PG does

Headings,, going back and forth! hard to see what was the last part
about without reading the whole god-damn thing

Allowed distractions, thinking about other things... Not
stressed... Goals, motivation
