[Seems like a good source to start](https://www.quora.com/How-close-must-you-be-to-a-cigarette-smoker-to-be-exposed-to-second-hand-smoke-If-you-can-smell-the-cigarette-smoke-at-a-distance-does-this-mean-youre-being-exposed) but do not have any conclusive
information like always. The guy who wrote that it is not harmful to
be exposed even a few seconds to smoke, who claims to have read tons
of articles is a smoker. I feel that his credibility is lost. He makes
fun of the people who fear smoke. He is not a doctor but a smoker who
has read and written about tons of smoking related studies. Yet I
don't see one or 2 studies, but constant reference to his books about
anti-smoking people.

Ok I revoke what I said in the beginning, the website linked is
useless.
