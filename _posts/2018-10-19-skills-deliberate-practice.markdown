## What do I need to do

- Write several instances where your thinking failed you

- Identify the skills from those instances.

- Provide a point-by-point training session design. Just like your
  workout schedule where you know the entire plan for the week, month even.
  
- We need to design our own practice sessions as these are not well
  established techniques like in sports to improve performance.

- There are 2 key aspects : 
	
	- doing something you couldn't do earlier 
	
		Like say gaining the ability to do Data Science or critical
        thinking like never before.
		
	- and then doing it on demand
		
		Knowing the scientific method and applying it as and when you
        encounter a problem, to understand or predict things.

My friend was cooking on a teflon pan which had much of its teflon
removed over usage. And he said, "eating teflon is not injurious to
health". Without any hesitation I have been eating that food for 2
years now. In another instance my friend said, "slightly burnt food is
carcinogenic". I ran away from "carcinogenic food" ever since. I didn't
even check it. I didn't need to?

I stopped wearing earplugs because I was afraid they would cause ear
infection and suffered a plethora of distraction. The difference is
quite a lot with and without this device. 

I drink protein shake twice a day for a while now. I have just
accepted that it is ok!

Drinking beer every week to the exact amount I drink, should cause no
harm to my health over the long term. Pfff! It gets off your system in
the form of piss right! The point is, given the opportunity, I wouldn't
hesitate to drink often. In India last year, I drank 4-5 times in a
week. Hmmm, so what is good for you again? I accept implicitly that as
long as I am not a drunkard (someone who has to drink everyday) --- I
consider my self a social drinker --- I will be in exceptional
health. Well!

I will find a house in the next 10 days if I put all my effort in
it. So far it has been a long long while since I started and it is
very hard to find a house. Claims without EE much?

I will find a job in less than 3 months once my company goes bankrupt
and that time will be peaceful. The last time I found a job it took me
a few months of practice followed by 3 months to land a job. With
experience it might be easier (which is the case now), but considering
the process times taken by companies, it could be a real big
nightmare.

**Impact of lack of such a skill**

In all of the above cases, it appears that it is quite important to
know the truth as I care extremely much about my health and my
long-term happiness. Researching before accepting claims as evidence,
could benefit me quite a bit.

**So how do I improve this?**

'Not accepting a claim without empirical evidence (EE)', sounds
simple. In any case it looks like 1. it requires training to identify
such claims, and 2. the training to look up or determine the
acceptable EE.

**Training to Identify claims of EE and non-EE**

Improving the first part, 'identifying claims that have no emperical
evidence', seems like it is similar to the music model, i.e., training
based on high focused repetition of task. So how would the DP of this
look like?

I could start by saying I will be conscious and collect 100 'claims
without EE', in day to day conversations by the end of the week. The
idea I think is to train the brain to notice the claims being made and
to separate them as ones with evidence and ones without. I reckon it
will be mind numbingly hard to stay focussed on every conversation and
every thought in an attempt to meet the goal of 100 claims. Hmmm, so
it is going to be painfull, in large numbers and your focus is
probably going to be only about this. That seems about right. This way
we can initiate the training process.

Another method could be to look at a source, a text or anything, and
determine the claims without and with EE. So this source could be
everything from the news, news comedies, political discourses, opinion
speeches, articles on life, religious preachings, my own writings,
writing of rationalists etc... I would like to keep the source
spanning various fields so that I can train for different ratios of
claims with EE and without EE. For example, Religious
preachings/debates, flat-earth discussions will give you a taste of
predominantly claims without EE, and writings of Eliezer Yudkowsky,
Paul Graham and STM could give you a taste of claims with
EE. Differentiating all of them, seems like it will help and would
allow practicing in large volume. In addition, I could as an everyday
task, identify 10 claims made during the lunch conversations and 5
claims made during the rest of the day during interactions with
colleagues.

**But what about feedback?** 

I use a log to note how many hours per day I spend on writing and
other activities. This serves me an indication over time, if I am
getting better, how my week was and if some days didn't go well and
why. The same could be done for every skill including this I
guess. Maintaining a log of daily claims identified with and without
EE over time gives us an indication of where we might be.

Engaging in questioning and evaluating if something has EE or not
could in itself be instructive. For both the above proposed methods,
following it up with a blog post to explain why something has EE and
something doesn't have EE, will help. This can then be used to get
feedback from external readers once in a while. This feedback will
tell you if the direction you are steering in is right or wrong and
where you need focus.

**What if there are some types of claims that you don't notice?**

There is a chance that I don't notice some of the 'claims without
evidence', in that case it would be nice to have external feedback
from someone who is better than you once in a while and focus training
to identify exactly that.

**Training to determine EE**

I would expect from me to determine EE for 1k claims. Obtaining claims
shall be easy. I can take them from my own life or the sources
suggested above. Determining EE for different types of claims would be
different. If the claim is like 'eating teflon is good', then I would
look at sources like stackexchange to give me info. If the claim was
that 'a temperature rise of 1 degree is expected if current human
pollution doesn't decrease', I would spend time reading a couple of
articles that refer journals (and look into those citations and check
if the articles are credible) to get EE.

I guess the way to go about it is to gather all the claims to be
investigated (atleast a 100 of them), classify them roughly on the
basis of the expected method of finding EE. And then take each class
and practice. This should be done on 1000's of claims atleast. Finally
a post on the different methods of finding EE with concrete examples,
identifying what counts as EE.

**Feedback**

The number of claims that I should theoretically come across should be
very similar with every week. So, if I record the number of claims
that I encountered per day, the number of claims I looked for EE and
the number of claims I successfully found EE for, then over a week I
have statistics. And logging this over time, I could get some useful
feedback about my progress, and level.

The intense study of these things could in themselves be
instructive. Of course like always, when in doubt or when you would
like feedback in certain aspects, it is best to write a post and ask
some one better than you to evaluate and give feedback and take it
from there.

**Problems**

There seem to be some potential pitfalls in this approach. I expect
most of the claims to be vague, in the first place, let alone with or
without EE. By vague I mean, the claim might not be verifiable in the
first place. I think I will start with this anyway and optimize as
necessary.

### Ability to communicate what is in the head in a systematic way

Often there is lack of clarity in my head and hence I am unable to
communicate well with people around me. I often start at a point and
then realize I forgot to tell something else and start over
again. This happens often in my work place, when in general I am
trying explain something that I have not much understanding of. Better
understanding helps, but in this case it looks like delivering the
information in a systematic way is the real problem.

I also notice the "same" thing in writing I think. I write all over
the place and then work on re-arranging things over multiple
iterations. It is painful to write like this where I don't have
clarity of what happened until now.

I was asked to deal with a trouble ticket which I had barely any
experience with. I had a look at it and had come back to my DL to
explain to him what the deal was and as expected I stammered, I
stuttered. I was slightly all over the place. I was not clear in my
head, atleast I couldn't see the flow of thoughts. In the end I
managed, owing to making notes in a notebook (observation, hypothesis,
tests)

This is almost everytime. Whenever I have to discuss anything with my
Design Leader/Boss (DL), I struggle to get shit out of my mouth in an
organized manner.

**How to DP**

During interviews I have found the STAR method (situation, Task,
Action, Result) to allow me to deliver my thoughts in an organized
manner. This I used to practice on everything that I was going to
deliver and managed to not stutter. Deliberately practicing this can
have a pronounced effect on my speech and maybe writing even, I
suspect. Maybe STAR might not be appropriate for delivering in the
above cases. I would first like to deliver the Problem, the
observation, followed by a hypothesis, test and results if applicable
i.e., POHTR (like Potter).

So the goal is to use this framework while communicating, to allow for
clarity. Improving this skill is very similar to the music method. So
practicing explaining using the POHTR method for a 1000 problems is
something that I should aim for. Where will I get so many topics to
talk about? Well, I could take sources from the news, news comedies,
TED talks, discussions on LessWrong and even the HPMOR work by Eliezer
Yudkowsky. Hopefully summarizing these topics will in addition to this
skill give me more understanding of the topics dealt with. The same
exercise can be used for both writing and speech.  

As for feedback, obvious feedback is you apply the above techniques in
situations in real life and see if you stammer or stutter. For
immediate feedback, I think I can re-read my essays, or play my
explanation-voice-recordings and determine how good or bad the
organization of thoughts was. Maybe other aspects to improve turn
up. An STM can give me feedback when he has time. For more feedback
you can ask your friends to listen to your discourse on youtube or
your blog, to give feedback of how much they understood or what you
need to improve on. A counter similar to the ones proposed in the
earlier section can be used as well to obtain statistics.


### Ability to solve unknown problem close to domain? 

At work I often get problems that I have no clue about. And it is my
task to work on solving them by asking the right people for help with
knowledge, going over the observations, proposing a hypothesis and a
testing, to diagnose the problem.

Had a meeting with my boss and another colleague (same age,background
everything) this week, to discuss an issue and how to solve it. I
sucked, the colleague who was into these kinds of trouble shooting
didn't suck at all and my boss was on top of everything. I was
surprised my colleague was this good, in the sense that he was able to
propose hypothesis and quickly look at pros and cons with a neat focus
on the goal. Whereas I had a bowl of thoughts being tossed inside my
head, struggling to make any reasonable contribution.

So looking at a lot of information all over the place, sometimes an
overwhelming amount even, throws me off. I would like a way to focus
on what is important (and why it is important) and improve my skills
in solving unknown problems like these, i.e., be much greater than my
colleagues and DL.

**How to DP**

>Coming to the applications: Much of "critical thinking", I would
>argue, falls under the chess model. The music model applies when you
>know what you want to say and it's about how well you say it. Whereas
>here, it's often a question of coming up with the right response to a

>ask yourself what move you'd make, and compare it to that of the
>experts. --- an STM

Luckily for me there is a plethora of trouble tickets (TTs) at my
work. I could say spend some time after work everyday, with the focus
of training my problem solving capability. Here domain knowledge might
be quite important, but as I said, I always worked on unknown problems
(atleast that's how my DL trains me to handle new modules) --- it's
also a way to learn about the system. So to keep it less overwhelming
I am going to look at TTs that are slightly in my domain. I should
take a look at few entries in the TT and propose actions, compare with
the actual entry and see just like in the chess model. We then move on
to the next entry.

My DL constantly works on solving some kickass problems for the
company. He gives his team the lame work and sometimes the nice
challenging work as well. I could look at the problems he has
solved. Not surprisingly I see that he uses the scientific
method. There is a clear statement of observations, followed by some
hypothesis that made it and some hypothesis that already failed, with
some clear tests. I could look at the problems he has solved and do
the same exercise of predicting what I would do.

>Real world as it is makes it hard to evaluate which of the proposed
>solutions is better. In any case the process of focusing on the
>problem and evaluating solutions is in itself instructive. 

**What about feedback?**

The obvious feedback is that you would be solving problems without
much intervention even when it is an unknown error. The feedback while
working on DP looks like it is built-in within the problem solving
framework. I could collect some statistics such as responses which are
correct over a week against the total responses made, time spent on
solving and the like, to allow me to know how I am doing.

### Solving a new problem (in life)

Since last year September (2017), I have been doing cardio 3-4 times a
week on average in addition to playing sports (1-2 times a week). I
started with riding the bike and an STM introduced me to the equation
of motivation. This meant that I get feedback of some sort, to know
how good or bad my workout is at a given instant. So I got a
speedometer for my bike. Well that was not really representative as
winds happened! So I started doing cardio at the gym (no winds). I was
looking at info such as current RPM and calories for feedback. But it
was not enough (i.e., doing cardio was painful mentally). I wanted
something more! I wanted something that would tell me about the
average workout rate during the workout. So I got a heartrate meter
(HRM). It pretty much does that, but now I want some finer statistics,
I would like to race against my own ghost even. What after I get the
exact statistics I want! Am I claiming to be able to do cardio on all
days? What do I want and what am I going after? Or will cardio always
be a strain mentally? In other words did I even understand the
motivation equation? Would thinking about body fat percentages help (I
remember an STM mentioning it)?

Upon the last measure I was at the same body fat % and muscle mass as a year
ago. It seems unclear how to go to 10% body fat despite doing certain
things. So obviously my 'fitness-model' is wrong. 

My RSI is cured. I also used the same ideas to work on my back and
knees (in terms of impact I deadlift and squat my max now), but I have
pain in some other areas occurring randomly. In order to investigate
if it is RSI-like, I would need a model that makes predictions? What
is this model and how do I make predictions?

The last one week I would come to the library and start working on
this essay. As soon as I start work I would feel sleepy. Somedays I
just couldn't resist and took a nap (30-45 mins). Then I would
continue working. At about 1-1.5 hrs in I feel the flow catching
on. What model can I use to determine why this is happening? How can I
make it feel like working on programming?

**Skills**

So, this appears to be like the last section on 'solving unknown
problems close to domain', but I am afraid working on those plethora
of trouble tickets, might not help in cases listed in this section.

So it looks like there are a couple of skills at play here. Making
accurate mental-models of the domain based on observations, making
narrow predictions and/or problem solving.

**How to DP**

To develop the above listed skills which seem to be interconnected, it
appears that the chess model would fit it, i.e., we would need to
solve a plethora of case studies and compare our performance to that
of the case study. But where do we go for such cases studies?

## Final words

This essay was really hard. As mentioned earlier, I wanted to sleep as
soon as I started on most days. But after like an hour of work, it was
alright. Generating skills off of life instances was quite a
challenge. Maybe if I see a few more examples it would help.

Today I realized how vague some of my DP for skills were, such as using
criticalthinking.org. And ended up in quite some re-writing. I am not
claiming my current DP for skills is like how I know my work-out would
be. Long way to go!

Most of the cases I came up with, seemed to end up with the skill of
'problem solving', such as cases of procrastination, failed
motivation, 'lack of application of theory to practice' etc...  I am
unsure how to deal with this skill on a DP basis. Where to source
example problems to be solved from (just like in the chess
method). And how to make this look like the chess method, aka get
feedback after every move.

Other things I was trying to explore was 'thinking aware of biases',
as I saw a recurring theme of allias paradoxes in the instances of my
life. But didn't have time to work on it.

I didn't deal at all with the aspects of doing something you couldn't
do earlier, and then doing it on demand. 

Overall I was not able to do 10 skills. I did something like 4 maybe!
Sorry!

P.S

Spent on average 3.6 useful hours per day for the last 7 days. ~25 hrs.
