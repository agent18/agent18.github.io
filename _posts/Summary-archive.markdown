#### My rough list!

<!-- <\!-- I think this needs to GO, DELETE! -\-> -->

Roughly I imagine the list to be:

1) Continuing in the same job or being a design engineer and rising
the ranks as so.

- Far too specific information learning at the moment (suspect it is useless)

As echoed previously to myself and in my archive, it appears that I am
learning something too specific, like how to make drawings and how to
design in tight tolerances, these are far too specific

- I do a bit of trouble shooting and critical thinking, I would like
  to do more.

- I do not want to work on puzzling out more about volumes and
interferences manually, say using (god-forbid) powerpoint. for
example, things I could do with a better tool. Of course I could have
a better way of work. Well let there be better problems to solve.

2) An MBA to management consulting or IB or trading(very high job
satisfaction according to 80k-hours) for now, hoping to get some
experience and a lot of money, to propel career ahead.

Right now it appears that the an MBA can open avenues into consulting,
IB and Trading. These seem to allow to get good experience and a lot
of money. Job satisfaction and long hours might suffer for a few.

Other than doing an MBA there dont seem many options. And I have
echoed my sentiment to a couple of MBA graduates who seem to agree
([IB at JP Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ram-narayan-86b7b199/)),([Marketeer from Newyork who has scholarships in
MBA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rawanalhaffar/)), Another friend who is an Analyst in California going into
product management.

But right now I do not need to make the choice of what I will be
taking. I can leave that decision for sometime in the future.

3) Data science (research, critical thinking?), moving on to
programming or not

I sort of club DS and programming together. As I see DS my first
direction to go into even if programming is what I might do in the
end. DS already involves some programming and I can get a job I think
quickly (3 months) in Netherlands and from there get better at it and
programming and see where it takes me. Although, DS would be much more
oriented towards critical thinking I guess.

4) Starting up

No idea where to start, no ideas of what to start, lack of skill and
confidence. A tech start-up sounds interesting, maybe I could find
some work there. I could go over to some meeting in rotterdam and see
what the scene is like.

I think we should expect a long lead time with tech startups,
especially ones that involve making a phisical product of any
nature.

Although I am currently working in a startup I see that I don't have
any "startup benifits"

5) Joining an EAO (Effective Altruism organization), starting as an Intern

6) Data-science or Programming in Finance (best of two worlds)
	
#### My next steps 

<!-- This has to go too -->

The focus for this article should be that I develop through this post
what I should do next, like in the next 6 months. Where should I begin
and what should I do.

I am broadly looking at few things based on the rough list I have and
the Career Quiz

1. Sticking to design engineering

	- Working in the US?
	- Staying in DE
	- Attempting to startup
	- Going into the NGO management after a few years in this field.
	
2. Moving to DataScience
   
   - DS
   - Programming
   - Machine learning PhD
   - Working at GiveWell type of NGO's
   
3. Doing an MBA

	- IB
	- NGO as analyst or management
	- Management Consulting
	- Marketting Sales
	- trading in quantitative hedge funds
	
	
4. Civil services

	Dont know where or how to start, other than in India, but I am not
    sure of the evaluating the kind of impact I can have in India
	
5. Think Tanks

6. Working at Effective Altruism organizations

### Questions to Ram

1. Can I multiply prolties? Is there a better way to do this while
   comparing different options

So I am attempting to estimate which career is my best fit. In order
to do that I look at the chances of an event A, B to G. I multiply all
of these chances to get my personal fit.

The problem is though, with every career, my events are quite
different and the number of events also are different.

Also, the more number of events I have my personal fit automatically
goes down big time. 80% probabilities in 2 events will give me a very
bad personal fit of 64%.

Can you comment on if this is the way of the world or can I do better?

**Answer**
Ram suggests to use atleast the same number of events for each case.

2. What is the best way to estimate lifetime salary.

My typical approach is assume a salary growth of 4% an inflation of 2%
and 10% increase every 5 years and take it all the way till I am 70.

By doing this my estimate really large salaries when I am say 70. I am
afraid it is realistic. So for example, my current salary is 40k/year,
I claim it to become 362k/year when I am 70.

Sometimes I really know what the salary is going to be at a certain
level and then I use that directly, say in the case of Management
Consulting.

Is there a better approach? Your thoughts on what I can do better and
what I am doing wrong.

**Answer:**
Above 45 the rise in salary cannot be as much as 4%. 

3. While evaluating careers. 

lets take MBA track with becoming partner, leaving Mc after 5 years or
do something else.

While estimating the P of each of this, the P of MBA multiplies.

I look at it like independent tracks, but in reality they are backup
options, which I will take up based on how they pan out.

How can I caliculate resulting number of balls I can buy?

**Answer**

P(partner)*impact of partner+P(mc)*feefles;

This might actually change some results and the contribution or the
total lives it can save Huh?

#### IB

[Rubin and Archer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ibMt0kQiw)were analysts quit IB for the following reasons:

- Despite putting 80-100 hrs/ week they still had to kiss ass,
  sometimes it doesn't make 
  
- Exit options are good apparently

- Mundane, not really, mainly ppts.

- Work goes unnoticed if kissing ass is not done 

- pretend to do work, when there is no work

- Very competitive

- Can learn the finance skills in 6 months.

- analyst to associate almost needs in MBA go in private equity and
  hedge funds (500k$)
  
- MBA for higher ups anyway most people.

- The skills you learn in IB can be got within 6 months (finanacial modelling), you don't
  really need to spend years working here to gain the skills
  
- Pure skills might be more freaking valuable or business skills that
  will allow you to scale a company from the ground up
 
- POlitics Bonus... 

- Pretend to do work... 

- Whether they like you are not. Unhealthy!

- They might not use your work everything you sacrificed. 

- He missed his cousins wedding and they still took the name out of
the book he made.

- If you focus on Statups and gaining crazy skill, then you will get
equity. and a fulfilling career. Stick to this part of the game.

----- 

What is IB?

Supporting companies that do mergers. Nothing sexy. As analysts
support the bbuying selling of companies, raising capital etc...

What do they do Day to Day?

There is an organizational schematic. The associate will drop at 7pm
in the evening a task of making 100 pages of document within the next
morning with good graphs and stuff that the higher ups can deal with.

Do market research, projections on excel what the company can
	buy... they present the ppt and engage as advisor. 1-2 months
	
Is IB fun?

Everybody is super excited. 100 hrs a week, not working on models
every week, lot of politics, youre even changing font colors on
things.

Lot of analysts use IB as a stepping stone finance and the corporate
world... exit opportunities. Hedge funds and private equity after 3
years. I am not sure I am 

21 years-  80-90k base ...signing bonus 10k ... bonus at the end of
the year...  75% to 100% of annual salary. 150 to 200 k ... By the 3rd
year you could make 250k . 150k easily @ 22 years. 100 hrs a week.


Exit opportunities: 

looks good on the resume.... good for MBA to exit to


Avg day: 8 to 9 am start.. 3-4 deals... need ppt by 3pm.. do
stuff... models draft by 2pm... follow up work for to other
things...until 7 pm. 

After that... you sometimes have to work until 2am and even drop off
the stuff at your MD's house. if you go to sleep at 6 am you are still
expected to come back to work at 10am. (get out of here)

Doesn't happen everyday, but it does happen. NO Weekends

168 hrs - 100 hrs work -40 hrs sleep = 28 hrs!

They have breaking into startups.

## Who earns the most

People in management law or Finance


## Consultant

X-BCG employee is glamourous?



## MBA

There are couple of things one can do after an MBA, such as management
consulting, Investment Banking Private Equity, Hedge Funds, Trading. 

I barely have a clue of what each of this is. 

In [this post](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/152549/working-for-mckinsey-bain-and-boston-consulting-vs-goldman-jpm-and-morgan-stanley) the difference between an IB'er and an MC't is
seen. 

> Investment banking (IB) denotes a financial service that creates
> capital for individuals and organizations, according to one
> definition. Investment bankers (i-bankers, or just “bankers”) give
> investors counsel on market strategies that can minimize their risks
> and maximize their returns. They provide assistance for mergers,
> acquisitions, and restructuring. Risk management is a major part of
> the i-banker job. - [MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/)


>A management consultant (MC) provides expert advice to businesses on
>operations, restructuring, and cost reduction. They are called upon
>to create strategies to help companies make a turnaround. They look
>at what their client companies have been doing and suggest what they
>can do to perform better. MCs deal with different types of problems
>and, for example, may be called upon to suggest to a marketing team
>how to improve its product delivery or advise HR people how to create
>a new health plan for employees.-[MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/)

It is clear from the above that one majors in Finance and the other
just in about anything to help a company get back or improve. MC's are
generally generalists, but somehow in the end are working for a
particular type of industry. 

Job satisfaction is expected to be better in MC than in IB, and the
hours are not that bad as in IB. Sometimes we work weekends, sometimes
not. IB in addition to all this shit, needs Facetime and 

Pay in MC is about 30-50% of an IB'er.

Pay in MC is detailed [here](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/nl-en/246284/work-in-management-consulting-how-much-you-will-make-at-mckinsey-bcg-and-bain). It appears that at Mckinsey one
earned in the year of 2017 an average salary of 140k. Which basically
a high performing engineer in apple can doing DS. [80k says a similar
salary for an associate as well (80 to 170k)](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/)

**PE** is usually seen as an exit opportunity for IB. I googled what
it is and found some finance jargon and I leave it at that. PE can be
as bad as IB in terms of hours clocked or not depending on somethings,
but the pay gets even higher than in IB is my understanding according
to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ibMt0kQiw). People usually work for a few years in IB and then
move on to PE. PE apparently has more interesting work. Hours are
better when deals are not being made. But if in the middle of the deal
16 hours. But PE hours for juniors might still be punishingly
hard. Pay is same apparently according to [this source](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/nl-en/178146/honest-account-working-promised-land-private-equity), but
somehow the environment is better and chances of a burn out are
less. The hours still look bad according to this [quora post](https://www.quora.com/Whats-it-like-to-work-in-private-equity).

**Hedge funds**

 So you start at a company
and based on the amount of success you add, you get a corresponding
compensation. So in the beginning years it is not really high as you
need time to learn the tricks of the game. 

>We found that junior traders typically earn $300k – $3m per year, and
>it’s possible to reach these roles in 4 – 8 years. Senior portfolio
>managers can easily earn over $10m per year,-[80khours-hedgefunds](https://80000hours.org/2017/05/how-much-do-hedge-fund-traders-earn/)

- Money is crazy. 
- Hours are not as bad as in IB (50-60hrs). Apparently as the job
  revolves around capital markets and market closes.

As pleasant as that may sound, a brief view of what happens as [shown
here](http://www.lifeonthebuyside.com/buy-side-analyst-good-bad-day/) wants you to get away from this as well. I cannot deal with
these things knowingly that they will happen some time. I am not cut
out for this, I think. I have hated it always and I would liek to add
value in a different way.

In all of these programs it is to be understood that there is crazy
competition and you need to be the best of the best. Also there is the
possibility of market crashing affecting you. With all the stress I
doubt I will be able to eat sometimes, or go to the gym even.

#### chances hedge fund
Earnings need to be corrected for chances of leaving a job to more
operational roles, future prospects of industry and personal fit.

## Economics Phd

Non quantitative background would need additional training. Being a
ME, I am not sure what I need.

165+ in GRE is definitely achievable with some training. 


### Personal fit

I don't know how much of a fit it is. So I am trying to estimate my
fit..

In [here (80k non-quants bc help)](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/) I find that it is rather hard to
get an Economics PhD, if we haven't done MATH or ECONOMICS. Atlest
that the switch wont be straightforward. 

Although I am in Engineering, the switch we are looking according to
the link above seems to be 1-3 years, i.e, doing a transition course
and then a masters and gathering up some decent references and then
trying to get a PhD.

I think it makes sense to consider what happened. It appears that
University of Florida (UF) is ranked 105 in 2015, the year I had
joined and TU delft is ranked 17 for mechanical engineering according
to [here](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2015/engineering-mechanical). Checking on another site informs me that TU delft is
fucking ranked 18. Get out of here!

That is going for me to say that I have actually been studying here
instead of in the US. 

The credentials that got me here in Mehanical engineering

Although I do see really fucking stupid people overall in TUDELFt,
unfortunately even in material science. People who are so stupider
than me. Who basically studied shit in their bachelors and yet got
admitted to rank 18 university. 

To further comment about TU delft. I see that, even in my batch, there
were some really intelligent people or rather, people who have done
some realted work on a subject before, but I could match their
intelligence by putting in more hours than they did with their social
life. 

The master that I joined also had one really dumb person, who somehow
managed to finish it. My problem is TU Delft although a credential
doens't reflect my capability. Although, I would say I will be inthe
80% of my class. mostly. I am not very dumb or anything, and towards
the 2nd year, I also earned quite some >9s in my subjects in subjects
that had a lot of math involved, also dynamics and the like. This I
can highlight for the team.

Coming back I cannot claim crazy references to get an eco phd. I
suspect I have better references now, example, Rixen, Matthijs from TU
Munich and Tu delft, and maybe Sandipan or Palram from IIT. Mostly I
should just do some economics course and score highly there say even
on course era or something. I need to get evaluated how good I could
be to get an Eco Phd from then on.

I think speaking to an Eco Phd guy or looking at the two guides I have
in front of me, shed more light.

But according to [ here (person from non-quants background)](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/), 

>The most straightforward route is to do either the one year economics
>diploma at Cambridge or the two-year masters at LSE (which has a year
>diploma at the beginning). These courses are designed for people who
>have done other subjects for undergrad, and if you do well in the
>first year you can progress on to do a masters. If you perform highly
>in the masters program, and line up some good references, you stand a
>shot at getting into a US PhD program at the end (and an even better
>shot of getting into an UK PhD).

Sounds like a 60% chance at best.

a) I don't have the money now to do a diploma 
b) If even then you "only have a shot", its not that good of a bet to
be placed.

Apparently a lot of harvard graduates have done a masters and then a
year of work in research to obtain a stellar reference, that gets them
some place good. 

[Certainity of finding soe job exists for sure](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html) according to Noah

My uncertainity lies in how do you define good?

How much time I need to prep for an eco master?

Frankly speaking Harvard is obviously not for me.




### How much good can you do?

[Here is one low probability scenario](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) working in the US federeal
Government agency. 

The article shows a true EA't who clearly looked at numbers and did
some amazing things. He seems very much in touch with reality, seems
to truly understand the value of one goddamn human life. So fucking
Inspiring. Wow. 

Coming back to actual impact, the author claims that a 20 year career
high of the person who interviewed him to be: raising some questions
during a meeting that probably has saved farmers from tens of millions
of dollars, in total. Thats it.

And probably nothing to this level will ever happen again.

>This is what you can expect your direct impact to be as an agency
>economist: find ways to save people money and make life a little less
>difficult for them, while still accomplishing the mission of the
>agency. This is a good life and a noble calling, for those who think
>about efficiency and the big picture, and it is unreasonable to
>expect more.

The author also shared his own stories in this regard wherein he ended
up with saving an estimated 400 lives (somehow only). Plus he also
earns more than 100k and is able to donate 30k, saving atleast 10k
people .

The key points to remember are:

>The main message of this story is that the direct impact of a
>government economist is extremely high-variance. Most of the time,
>you will do nothing to make the world better. Occasionally, you will
>do something that prevents a few million dollars from being
>wasted. And if you get very very lucky, you might do something that
>saves the statistical equivalent of hundreds of lives.

### Am I good enough?

- High grade (min. 3.5+)

Based on [authority conversion of dutch score to US](https://www.studyinholland.nl/documentation/grading-systems-in-the-netherlands-the-united-states-and-the-united-kingdom.pdf) and wiki's [internal
US conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States), I think my grade is 4.0/4.0. [Another source](https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/764/how-are-grades-different-in-the-netherlands-compared-to-the-us.html)
suggests that my grade 3.75. Both seems to be decent. 

- I will work hard on quants and try to obtain 165+ in GRE

I think I can. But Verbal I have no control over.

- Good reference letters

This is the thing that I have not much idea about.

## To Vinod

### Earning potential if you make partner 

**Impact**

- partner after 45

	- At associate level we get 130k 
	- after 5 years 250k
	- after 7 years 450k
	- 600k + bonus after 7 more years say
	- inflation of 2%
	- retiring at 57
	- getting 75% last drawn for the rest of life (another 20 years
      atleast)
	- I didn't take into account the bonuses which is expected to be a
      lot more.


- Earning by once we leave industry in 5 years

	- With compound interest of 4% a year
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- for a beginners salary of 150k (assumption i.e., after quitting
      MC)
	  
## Age

Learning to program later in life:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4350827

A decent site quoting studies and not quora for crying out loud
http://www.mempowered.com/aging/why-learning-harder-we-get-older

17 year olds were affected much more by interference in learning than
were 9 or 12 year olds.

Quoting some scientist
https://www.fastcompany.com/3045424/what-it-takes-to-change-your-brains-patterns-after-age-25

In the above article they talk about how we can make new pathways when
we are young and that as we get old it will be harder. I doubt that I
am unable to learn something new say when I am 32. 

Granted it will slower than I can now due to the plasticity thingy,
granted there will be young people who are faster than me in
that, but I suppose I have laid down some foundation for it. By that I
mean it won't be completely new.

The thing I am worried about is about having enough time to learn it
and having opportunities to intern and then change job.

I am looking for an answer where people tell me "Don't try to learn
something completely new at the age of 35" for example.
