From September 5th until December 1st I had been training almost 5
times a week, including cardio of 20 mins and lifting weights. I fell
sick for a week and then left to India for about 5 weeks. I was sick
here on and off (acidity, food poisoning, lot of drinking, fried food,
sleepless nights etc...). I still did manage to workout ~2 times a
week amidst all the struggles.



I am back in Delft and the first thing I notice is that I wake up with
some excruciating pain in my back. I have never had so much upperback
pain (between my shoulder bones), when I woke up. It continued for a
few days to the point that I would for sure wake up at 5 am and then
not be able to sleep and then roughly sleep and feel weak and go to
work. I still managed to work out 4-5 times a week. The pain I had
lasted for an hour before vanishing for the entire day.
