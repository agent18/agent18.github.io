4 more days left and at least 12k$ left to go, i.e., 24k$ more in
"total donations". More info available on their [donation

## But why haven't many people donated already?

Please help me understand "why you did" or "why you didn't" donate by
filling up an [anonymous form that takes 10s to complete](https://forms.gle/AqqJB1DmiZStwLPc9). Please
do fill it in. Thanks.

I remember thinking that it was just 20k$ and that it would be done
in no time, but it isn't. It started 17 days back. With 10 days to the
deadline it was at 5k$ and with 4 more days to go it is now at 7k$
(with 22 donors). I don't believe this will get to 20k$ in time.
