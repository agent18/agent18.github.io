In a post looked at earlier, [MBA](/mba.html), we had a look at what an MBA
means and we look at different universities where it would be
possible to do an MBA.

I don't have money and I don't want to gamble with what I have right
now, or what I could possibly save. 

I would like a scholarship at a great university, which would properl
me to great heights there after.
