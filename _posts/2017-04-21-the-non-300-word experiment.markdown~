Last week I did the 300 word experiment where I wrote 300 wrods a day, but then I have not done much after. I didnt plan another pact with a friend for 30 eurso. I just went with the flow

Last two days including today I find that I spend time as much as possible watching youtube. Recently I am trying to write a hard essay, and I find the need to procrastinate even more.  Just like in those 600 word a day post essays. 

At this point I am just writing some 300 words. I am like what is the point. no seriously what is the point! 


I find that when I am at home it is harder to write, I dont really write. Uesualy I think Vishwesh house helps. as he works and I work as well.

Last sunday I decided I am going to not have messenger on my phone. I still end up spending around 3 hrs on the phone everyday. Facebook I guess was not really the problem.

I think this is too wague and broad. I need something that will make me write and also make write well. I need to spend long times on writeing and withou being distracted. How does 4 to 6 sound?

Anyways tomorrow will write the post on availability and plan one for the next day as well. in the  realm of hpmor or stm essay collection.

The writing of this essay is itself a joke. Of course I am greatly maximising the number of words. 

How about making a couple of posts compulsory and also making some time to get off of the phone when I am back home? or go to a fucking library. No more excuses.
