## Practice tests

numerical, inductive and deductive seem to be the main focus


### inductive reasoning

The term inductive reasoning refers to reasoning that takes specific
information and makes a broader generalization that's considered
probable while still remaining open to the fact that the conclusion
may not be 100% guaranteed.


Guidelines clearly indicate to click somehting and not waste too much
time on it...

You must complete the entire test to avoid score reduction.

### num reasoning

Anytime you see "Speed is x% more than oldSpeed", think of...

than --> baseline --> oldspeed

`(New Speed- old speed)/oldspeed`

**All the following are equivalent**

Final Edit: I would say these things.

B is 500% faster than A (`(B-A)/A=500%`)
B's speed is 600% of A's (`B = 600% A`)
B's speed is 6 times as fast as A's (`B=6A`)
B's speed is greater than A's by a factor of five(awkward IMO)

**per pen cost**

Cost per pen --> Cost for X pens divided by number of pens.

## result

It was way harder with inductive reasoning and towards the end it was
impossible to stay focussed and get to an answer.

What helped was to repeat these questions over and over again. Got
many similar questions where format was very similar, so I had
alraeady worked out format about writing the questions and solving
it...

Took me 11 hrs of preparation with tons of procrastination.
