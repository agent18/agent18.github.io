With this post I want to write about where I am at with my career
change decisions. Why it is taking time and what I can do to speed it
up.

## Career @

To begin with I would like to be in a position of either
earning-to-give a lot, if possible in 100's of thousands of dollars
and/or would like to work and lead or research things that can make a
lot of contribution to mankind. As vague as that sounds, some concrete
examples would be working in say investment banking and then moving
out of it after a few years to found companies that make sense to the
world. Another example would be to join 80khours and give support to
people who can earn to give. In essence multiply your impact majorly. 


Or we could also donate to 80k hours who have their costs to coach
people. That way 

As it is highly unclear what needs to be done, or as it gets more
complex to write about things, as there are endless side-tracks
availble, the easier thing to do is to procrastinate. Like what I am
about to do now.
