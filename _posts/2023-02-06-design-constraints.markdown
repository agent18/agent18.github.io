## The Constraint is in your head

In earlier posts we saw that constraints make our decision making
easy. When my ~~purpose~~ constraint was to save as many lives as
possible, it was very easy for me to decide what to do. Go to the US?
Hell's yeah. 

Unfortunately, I don't have those constraints no more. Now that I am
constraint less, what do I do? In the [last essay](/constriaint-in-head-2.html), we realized
that we cannot blindly accept constraints, nor can we randomly take
constraints like "having a baby" just because four billion other
people are doing it. During all this we are the ones judging if a
constraint is ok or not. The constrain is seemingly in our own heads.

Not only this the constraint in our head has a tendency to change
with time, are sometimes hard to apply and get meaningful results, and
we can even discover new ones (ones that we currently don't know
about).

## The constraints in my head

Here, I want to be happy. I don't want to be miserable. I want to be
excited. 

This immediately draws me to the three types of lives that martin
seligman is talking about,. the good life, the meaningful life and the
life of flow.

Because Flow and meaning are the ones that "generate lasting
happiness" I would look into these. And try to somehow raise the flow
levels?

I will not kid. I think I am happiest when I play sport. It keeps me
going back for more. In a life where i sport everyday, I look forward
to it, it makes my day. I was recently in big community and there
there were 15 year old kids playing ball everyday. I played for three
days and it was great fun. I really look forward to something "social"
and sporty. Gym is fun, but it is a very lonely sport, I do prefer
social sports like basketball or climbing. 

However an STM seems to detest it, I need to know more. Because here I
am thinking this is science, it is a fact. 

## The constraints from others

Recently I was watching a tamil serial, where they thought the
~~purpose~~ constraint of their life was "to live gauruvama" (you have
to live so that people from your caste respect you), otherwise it was
not worth living. Lite I'll pass.

My parents thing constraint of my life is to get married and have
companion. Lite I'll pass. Do they even realize how painful it is for
them or for their DIL and Son to deal with their daughter?

An STM thinks YOLO should help generate some constraints. YOLO
constrains the space a bit. It's interesting. 

What does yolo do? YOLO tells me suntings... It says something like
what are the things you want to do before you die? Then I am thinking
things like "traveling". What do I mean by traveling? 

YOLO also means I would need money to do things. Hmmm! how much money?

Does that mean I should go to the US and come back in a bit? ok. Let's
see. 

Everything so far is vague as hell. 

## YOLO

Let's explore this. YOLO for me means there is no point struggling to
insane levels only to produce money for the rest of the life. 

Lets try to see what YOLO forbids. Be an investment banker until you
are 50. Easy no. However be an IBer for 10 years? and retire?
Hopefully by then you have a mill to 2. and move back to netherlands
with cash that people would never dream of having? at that age. 

I think we shoudl stick to the question at hand and otherwise it
becomes vague or shooting openly, so to say. 

## YOLO

Travel?
Climbing on real rocks?
Music? Sing in a choir?
Instagram followers?
Be fit?
live long?
Happy?

And fuck you persuasion is a big deal of what I feel what I want to
do? But so what everything has persuasion..

Music production? 

What am I doing... Going into an unbounded space lol. 

How do you even decide. There are many solutions... 

Don't have kids?
Don't marry?
No girlfriend?
What about sex?

You live only once so visit every country? I want to have new
experiences? I want to hike to gorgeous views. I want to go see
Japan. 

Have I ever traveled? what did that feel like? Is it something you
want to do?

What about funding? How much money do you need? Say you wanna go to
iceland? I don't know if I wil lie them I wanna try them. 

Also you don't need to have a crystal clear plan. you just need a
direction? Can you make a decision? on life? the current question?

Am back to life has no purpose... Pushing to be better at work? why?
who cares? for money? yeah makes sense?

## how do you distinguish between persuasion and "what you actually
want"?

What are the tests that it needs to pass to be "actually what you want"?
