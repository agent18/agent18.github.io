#### **OLD age**

>You need someone or you'll feel lonely.    
-my cousin said one day, when I told her I don't plan to marry.

I sometimes feel lonely, yes. But in the recent days I have been quite busy with either work from office and then sports followed by cooking and then working on my essays. It has been tight and full of flow. I don't know anymore about dealing with my loneliness when it shows up.

Why didn't any of the people in the ["Dont marry"][dont_marry] thread say anything about lonliness. Why do they think away from marriage is the best thing. Is marriage so bad that literally anything else is better? I am saying that I can anticipate and guess things that are going to happen, but what is the reality, does it really affect us?

__When I am old?__

Assuming I am able and can move around like my father at 60, then I can work at an NGO, or at a temple/mosque/church for example. I can continue some sort of consulting work based on my skills gained over the years. If I am in India, then I would prefer to be around my cousins and of course, continue sporting and going to the gym. Being married, I guess, will only curb my freedom. Also probably I wouldn't have as much money, if I am married, to spend on the things in the world.

If I am not able to work anywhere, because of my lack of fitness, then probably sign into an old age home or someplace where I can be taken care of for cheap. Or even hang around with cousins who are rich. 

If I am completely not able to move, yeah I should just find my peace, read books and do whats best possible with the money I have. 

In some more years, we should have implants that always communicates with your doctor and raises alarm on its own, in case of emergencies. So being alone and old, I can still be cared for in case of emergencies.

All these above scenarios can be thought of with an old wife, who still continues to be a pain. Maybe she helps you in your last days, or maybe she even dies before you . All your kids are probably not around to help you personally(as is the case with every single uncle and aunt in my family). If you think your kids are going to help you financially when you are old, then think again about the reason to have kids. For example, you can compound the money you save now or make wise investments and use it on a rainy day. And the best thing is if you don't have kids to spend your money on now, then what is the problem?

Looking at all the members in my family, I am not too worried, about old age. Most of them can walk around easily and do their own things. They travel to different places all the time and are capable of doing so. In my family, my dad is 60 years old and fine with health, he can walk pretty far. He is still energetic and interested in share-market and the likes. 2 of my mother's uncles are around 80. They are weak. One is in an old age home, and the other in a normal house with his wife. Both of them are quite able to move around, but one of them needs to be checked regularly. He was taking care of himself for a long time, despite all odds and then got himself checked into an old age home, after being alone for about 6 years I think. I assume that I will have similar if not better health.  Hopefully, still running and going to the gym like [scooby][scooby].

I wan't to do a lot when I can. Focus on health and leave the rest to nature to take care of. I don't want to spend my precious years (26-80) hating my life with a marriage.  I have big goals, bigger dreams, I can't waste this life that "GOD" has given me, at any cost. You have one life to make a difference. 

# Open Issue
Why does my brother and all my cousins and parents think they should marry and go on to say that I should marry? odd!

People who marry look so happy outside! But they look so happy outside? Probability
