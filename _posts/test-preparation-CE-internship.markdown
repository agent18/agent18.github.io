We are examining **guided self-help** as a potential intervention for
this year's charity ideas. Guided self-help can be used to target many
different psychiatric disorders or other problems such as chronic
pain. It can involve a variety of therapy techniques; we are most
interested in examining bibliotherapy. Your instructions are as
follows:

1.  Familiarize yourself with **bibliotherapy** as a form of guided
    self-help by reading sources you see as relevant.

2.  Use our informed consideration methodology ([link](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/informed-consideration.html#ICcrucialconsiderations)) to create a
    list of crucial considerations (CC) that you think should be
    examined before recommending this charity idea.

3.  Research the CC you think is most important.

You have a total of ~5hrs to complete this task (note: using
significantly more time will handicap your application). Please reply
to this email with the test task attached within a week of receiving
it. If you have any further questions about the test task feel free to
contact me.

## Process

1. What is bibliotherapy

2. Identify CC before recommending a charity idea

	- how much Impact?
	- Is there evidence of it working?
	- Are there other charities doing it? counterfactual impact
    - Is it neglected?
	- How many DALYs saving younger is better? age related... Focus on
      impact
		  - People 
		  - shorter life
		  - disability
		  
	  - disease burden, epidemiologic studies, clinical surveys
	
	- Scale (Good done/% of problem solved)
		How many people suffering?
		how much impact?
		How many people?
		How many DALYs
	- Neglectedness (% of problem solved /%increase in resources)
		Are there current charities that are working on it?
		Are they funding constrained? or why aren't they doing it?
		How much funding it has?
		
	- Solvability (% increase in resources for extra person or $ added)
		Is there evidence that it will work?
		
		
	Scale – if we solved the problem, how good would it be?
	
	Solvability – if we doubled the resources dedicated to solving
	this problem, what fraction of the problem would we expect to
	solve?  
	
	Neglectedness – how many resources are already going towards
	solving this problem?

## CC

**Entry question**: Should we start our own intervention charity based
on bibliotherapy? What are the significant considerations that could
affect the initiation or continuation of the intervention.

1. Is there evidence of **intervention working**? (RCTs or surveys or
   studies)
	   
	   - strength of evidence (RCTs surveys studies)
	   - number of people in the evidence
	   - how weak or strong is the evidence
	   - number of people in the data
	   - how is the data chosen (random) (refer SS)
	   - how is the data allocated in the RCT (refer SS)

2. Is there evidence of the intervention **not working**?
   what are they? Criticism etc...
   
   Is bibliotherapy hocus pocus (how is the material chosen --> seems
   vague)
   
   Are scientists devided on this? how so?
 
 
3. **Uncertainties**?

   Are there difficulties in reaching people with the intervention?
    
   What sort of people is this supposed for? the 96% or 50% who didn't
   get help.
   

3. **Neglectedness**? Resources allocated to this intervention
   already?
   
   Are there things missing like funding or awareness or other things
   that we can improve to reach BT to everybody?
	
   Is someone else performing the intervention? What issues do they
   have? Should we fund them or help them scale up or start a new
   charity?
   
   Would it be possible for a charity to even pick it up? How would
   that look like?

6. **Scale** of impact in DALYs or atleast number of people (cea?) that
   could potentially be effected by the intervention?

	What sort of illnesses is it for (low mood anxiety and stress?),
	how many people can it actually help? 

    > In the 1980s and early 1990s, bibliotherapy was a widely used but
    > poorly researched therapeutic model. However, numerous randomized
    > controlled trials (RCTs) have documented the positive effects of
    > bibliotherapy for clinical conditions such as deliberate self-harm,
    > obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and bulimia nervosa and
    > insomnia. Research also supports bibliotherapy as an intervention for
    > a wide array of psychological issues including emotional disorders,
    > alcohol addiction, and sexual dysfunction. -wiki

	What sort of ages is it for?
	
	What countries would have max impact and how many people?
	
	Actual people possible to improve (96%)? Is it all people with
    mental illness or just the people who have MNSS and are seeking
    help (50%).

7. **General:** 

	How does the intervention work?
	
	Costs incurred by affected person in low-income countries (aka
    without insurance?) or does the non-profit pay.
	
8. What sort of diseases can it cure? 

	What is population of that?
	
	Which tract to use? Affective or CBT?
	
9. Where does BT feature?

	
    > low rates of recognition of their problem by people with
    > depression, low rates of consultation by people who do recognise
    > that they have such a mental illness, barriers to access
    > treatment37 and poor treatment adequacy. --- Undertreatment of
    > people
	
10. How long does the effects last? 

11. Challenges to Acceptability?
	
## Which CC is important?

Not sure. I would ideally like to investigate 3 of them asap...

I feel scale might be for a CEA. neglectedness can add value here
informing what part of the intervention we should could focus on and
if there are ways to do that? Also anti-intervention seems most
useful, atleast you check out the issues with it?

So I guess I will start with viewing the evidence and look at the
criticism.


So I think I am going with looking into the studies and looking for
criticism and if time permits strength and uncertainties will be
investigated.

Let's do a 5 minute study on each of them?

Am I looking for types of MNSS this is going to be useful for? no?
just what are the cases where it doens't work? and work? and where are
the uncertainties?


## bibliotherapy

- Use of books as treatment of mental or psychological disorders 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotherapy

> Bibliotherapy (also referred to as "book therapy" poetry therapy or
> therapeutic storytelling) is a creative arts therapies modality that
> involves storytelling or the reading of specific texts with the
> purpose of healing.


> It is a brief therapy based on the principles of Cognitive
> Behavioural Therapy (CBT) which aims to support people with mild to
> moderate common mental health difficulties, such as low mood,
> anxiety and stress.

https://www.insighthealthcare.org/our-services/talking-therapies/types-of-therapies/guided-self-help/


> Your sessions may be weekly or fortnightly and you will have an
opportunity to agree the number of sessions in your treatment plan
with your Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner.  Guided Self Help can
be delivered over the telephone or in person at your GP surgery or
other local venues close to you with sessions lasting up to 30
minutes.

So you are engaging witha practitioner and having treatments over in
person or over the phone and the treatment you are going to use is
bibliotherapy.

Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner


## clinical use

### Tracks

Affective --> fiction (not much research but there is Shectman)

using CBT --> self-help books ("lot of research")

Visual based materials --> graphic novels etc..

## how to implement it?

Classroom reading?


## RCT's

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02307097

114 people for social anxiety disorder RCT

~~Social anxiety weighs [390 DALYs per 100,000 people in 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451993). For
such a disease burden, the solution of "self-help CBB" are not
standalone recommended. But could be used as a prelude to
high-intensity CBT. Does CBB help in either reducing CBT sessions or
can it be used alone?~~


This wiki source seems to be someone personal document collection and
refering to "studies" based on results such as "brilliant". I don't see
any statistics of how many said X and Y. Main article for RCT's. Not
convinced at all. IF several people go into a study and you don't
report the outcome fully then how are we to
judge. https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/mental-health-services/powerofwords/patientsbibliotherapy.pdf

Moreover it was an interview styled hardly RCT!

A Randomized Controlled Trial of Bibliotherapy for Carers of Young
People With First-Episode Psychosis

First episode psychosis carers of young people with first-episode
psychosis with PSBI (problem solving BI), RCT resulted in greater
reduction of negative emotional evaluations, whicle psycological
distress decreased at "greater rate" from basedline over 16
weeks. Seems to help confidently but not sure by how much.

To be noted this is used in adjunct to GOLD STANDARD SUPPORT FROM
SPECIALIST.

I see repetitive points that it might not be standalone and would
still need external help from a therapist say.

A randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of an
acceptance and commitment therapy–based bibliotherapy intervention
among adults living with chronic pain

**Conclusion:** statistically significant differences between pretest and
posttest in terms of pain-related disability (main variable),
depression (secondary variable), pain-related acceptance, and
psychological inflexibility (d = 0.46–0.88) in favor of the ACT
self-help condition. At the 3-month follow-up, these differences were
maintained and nearly 54% of participants reported an overall
improvement of their physical and mental health.


**Summary**: There are different types of BT for different conditions
(chronic pain ACT for example). BT seems to be better than wait list
cases. Cheap to administer (in cases wth "minimal therapeutic
contact").
