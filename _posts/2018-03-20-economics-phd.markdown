## Why? 

An Economics PhD is considered by 80k hours as one of the most
important things one can do, given certain attributes.

>you have a high chance of landing a good research job in academia or
>policy – promising areas for social impact – and you have back-up
>options in the corporate sector since the skills you learn are
>in-demand (unlike many PhD programs).

## What do you need?

- 165+ GRE score; 160+ is still not good!
- 3.5 GPA or higher especially in economics and mathematics degrees
- Killer letters of recommendation from people known in the field

If you are not from Economics or a Mathematics UG, it is still
possible to get a PhD from the US. Some advice is given [here](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/). The
bottom line is that we need transition years to either do another
masters followed by some research before applying or at least do a
diploma (1-3) years transitioning for a 5-7 year economics
PhD. Apparently this is the scene in Harvard even.

US PhD's are the ones to aim for according to 80k hours. One of the
reasons for going for a US PhD instead:

>Funding for post-graduate study in the UK is highly uncertain at each
>stage even if you are really good.


## Academia and real world

In case shit hits the roof, getting a job in the real world is
apparently easy as evident by the statistics. This field has the least
un-employment rates as compared to any other field

More than 50% go into academia with a decent median salary of 108k$.
>Academic jobs: 
>You can do research on high priority cause areas, like ending extreme
>poverty (see e.g. MITs Poverty Action Lab) or cause prioritization
>(e.g. in support of the work of the Copenhagen Consensus).

" Non-academic profiles jobs: 
- Government (e.g. Federal Reserve, Treasury, Department of Justice)
- Non-profit research organizations and think-tanks (e.g. RAND, National Bureau of Economic Research)
- International organizations (e.g. World Bank, International Monetary Fund)
- Business/Industry (e.g. investment banking, economic consulting)"-

## TODO 

   * [ ] Age to do a PhD?
   * [ ] How about a masters? How about the exploration value for
         that?
   * [ ] And opportunities to do direct work/ work in the industry?
   * [ ] What are the downsides of going in this path
   * [ ] Can you make it?
   * [ ]  Still need to write about Skill, connections, credentials
          and runway
   * [ ] What about an economics master and then a PhD, do I have the time? 

P.S total time spent 45-1 hr non continuous
