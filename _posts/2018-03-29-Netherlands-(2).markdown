## DUTCH PR

**Dutch PR**

  * [x] You have been living in the Netherlands for 5 years or more with a valid residence permit. 

  * [ ] You have had an uninterrupted 5-year stay in the Netherlands
        before submitting the application. This means that in those 5
        years you have not stayed outside the Netherlands for 6 or
        more consecutive months, or 3 years in a row for 4 or more
        consecutive months.
		
I have not stayed outside the netherlands for 6 or more consecutive
months. I am quite confident I pass this requirement as I went to
Germany for 7months, but came in between twice for 2 weeks or so.

  * [x] Pass civic integration
  * [x] Registered in the Gemente
  
I should be fine for the other small things.

Again I am not sure if this 5 year period is inclusive of my 2 year
masters.(TBC)

indefinitely. Your residence permit document is valid for five years,
and can be renewed.
