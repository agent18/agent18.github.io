#### Introduction

During my religious times, I and my friends would focus on being in "Good company". That is to say that we hang out with other religious people, or listen to scriptures and the like. I guess the point was to focus only on 'God', and nothing else. Makes sense for someone who's ultimate goal is to be one with GOD, to maximize the time he spends learning and hearing about GOD. In a similar idea it can be said that, when rationality is so important to make right decision and we hardly are, when it is the difference between night and day, when it can help you make the decisions no body else can, when thinking loud, writing clearly about things and doing the hard work is the only known way to make the 'right' decisions, shouldn't we be in similar "Good company as well". 

Ideas might seem clear in the head, but they pass the official test of being 'understood' only when you are able to explain it to someone either in person or via a post. It's often times clear to me, how much I suck, when I see instances of myself sucking while trying to explain a concept I thought I 'knew'. For example, I think there is a defined way in which I am using single courts, double courts and no courts. I guess I am trying to use double courts in the usual way as we use air-courts, i.e., when using something sarcastically of questioning the actual intention of words. For example, earlier I used "Good Company". The courts was only to inform that there is nothing really good about it. So now you ask me "why do I use single courts again?". I use single courts when the meaning of a word is fuzzy and yet I let it pass. For example, in this paragraph I use the word 'understood', in single court, in the first sentence. This is because I don't fully explain what I mean by understood and I expect the reader to move on from it. Coming to think about it, I also use single courts, when referring to something, as I did in the previous sentence with understood. Anyways, I guess now it is sort of clear why I use single or double courts. The words just didn't flow out of my head. It was a deliberate effort to explain something that clarified the thinking for me. I guess we can see that I 'clarified' my thinking, looking at the time it took to actually write this. It was 15 mins

Writing seems to clarify thought. Writing seems to be my 'good company'. When I write I think about rationality and such. When I don't I am on my own worried more about 1st world problems and thinking about them.

I have been writing for the last 6 months on and off. I was trying different experiments to see which one keeps me going on and on. But ultimately it was motivation from within to make the 30 post challenge. Some of the metrics I use to measure my progress implicitly are number of posts written in x days, number of posts written different periods, number of words written per post and the like. I often quote this to my friend who I arranged to pay 3 euros for lack of a post everyday (except fridays), "Look at what I have been doing from Jan to may (15 posts in total) and May to jun(>15 posts)". It's been 6 months since I began my journey of writing for the last time. At the end of each essay, I look at the number of words I have written. Something around ~500 seems fine by me on a weekday, considering the time I spend on say researching for the article, followed by writing it up and then finally reading it and correcting it as necessary. 

Currently I informed in the introduction that I use the following metrics implcitly to make the distinction if I stink or not:
	a) Number of words per post
	b) Number of posts in a given time irrespective of word count per post
	
a) These although might have some merit to it, cannot be the binding clause to determine if I stink or not. Why? An STM wrote to me once, he said, "I will not read any post of yours, that is less than a thousand words due to certain recent revaluations regarding that". STM doesn't joke around. He means business. From what an STM says, number of words>1000 is only a precondition, not a metric.

b) I have no way to justify that this is helping. The number of posts metric, only tells that someone has been _trying_ to get work done.

All of the above suggested metrics seem upsurd.

My friend came to me a couple of years back and said, measure not the means but the end. He explained further, that there is no reason to believe that your means will get you to the end. Example, measuring number of words to improve your rational ability.

What we wan't to ultimately do is measure the end. God forbid, what is the end? A milestone perhaps? 

#### What is the End?

Just like at work, the end could be milestones!

1) EA or not, else what?
2) What should I do in life, 
	a) Continue design job @ 40k Euros per annum, with a savings of 12k euros per year!
	b) Startup and earn in millions of Euros.
	c) MBA at top university, ending with an annual savings of...
	d) Finance job earning 130 k $ per annum in US, with an annual savings of...
	e) programming job earning 130 k $ per annum, with an annual savings of... 
3) Grow as an action taking rational thinker

#### Milestone

In ["Deep Thinking"][stm_deep], an STM had talked about Cal Newport and quoted one of his points. So for now I assume Cal Newport is a trustable source to provide quality information.

Cal Newport, in [this post][cal_deep] talks about 2 ways to measure success
	a) Milestones
	b) Hours spent working deeply towards a milestone

Let's say the ultimate goal for us could be for example to clear the GATE exam to get a particular score. Keeping this vision(END) in mind, we can have some milestones say through the month. And a proper definition-of-done for each milestone should help us track our progress. For example, one milestone could be to 'Successfully finish the Structural dynamics topic' with a definition-of-done being that I should be able to solve all the previous years questions.In such manner every subject can be 'finished'. This can then be followed by mock tests for the entire paper and then improving on aspects where we lag to produce the sufficient score.

In some cases things are not possible to come up with good estimates for milestones. or it is not possible to know the progress for a particular job but we need to know how we are doing still right? Cal Newport suggest in these cases to count the number of housrs spent working deeply towards a particular milestone. He further adds on in his post that a hybrid measurement of the milestone as well as deepthinking hours should help.	

A post takes its own time to come about. I cant force it and finish it within a day. But is that what we want. There is no time deadline here. 

How will I know when I going to meet the milestone. I want to know something. I don't want to count the words. I dont want to count the posts But I still want to know that I am putting in sufficient effort in the right direction.

how can you put a nuimnber on the number of days before which you will be xx rational.
#### Measure the end and not the means

The above metrics can be used to produce more content. The content although should be judged with its own metric. Having established that the above metrics are weak, we look at the end.

Your ultimate goal can be to say clear the GATE exam with a particular grade.

One of the other suggested metrics by an STM was to measure the number of arguments explained.

More over, I still continue measuring with the above discussed sad metrics implicitly. My goal currently was to write everyday for which I set myself up for a pact with a friend where in, I write every day and publish a post, except friday with a penalty of 3 euros, everyday I missed. I didn't put constraints on the number of words, except that the post should have been revised atleast once. I usually see that it is around 400 words and of some "internal" quality. The point of doing this is to primarily get the confidence of an STM to co-conspire. In the case that it does not work out it still serves the purpose of having inculcated a habit in me, to keep writing, with a penalty of 3 euros in case I don't write in a day.

#### An Assesment
It's been 6 months since the beginning of the year. how far have I come? 

#### What next?

I came across this guy on my friends blog in his post on deep thinking. The idea being that we should look at deep thinking. Deep thinking to the extent that you measure metrics such as number of deep thought hours, as sometime you do not know how long a task can take. The other thing being using milestones. It "feels" like a nice balance between these two should help. More on this tomorrow. I know its a friday. But today I did shit.
