##  Why Emacs

An STM suggested to me that if I am looking for something over the long term (20
years or more) I should check out EMACS. [This video][emacs_video] showed how
emacs could be used by writers, people who are not programmers, people who would
like their shit to be not clumsy AF, People who would like to free their mind of
the all the shit that is hindering your progress.

You want to be at your creative best and not be bogged down by shit like
formatting and the like (for example writing in word and bleeding from your eyes
as you get shit done). Plus the things that org-mode can do are really fancy
as mentioned in [the same video linked above][emacs_video], they give us better
control over what we are writing with simple key strokes.

In summary, 

- you don't have to move your hands to the right (dark) side of your keyboard.
- emacs has keybindings (shortcuts) for basic movement, without moving to the
  right side of your keyboard 
- we write in plane text and plane text only.
- org-mode allows to see just the headlines, minus the text with simple
  keybindings
- You can split the screen which ever way you want (all with hot keys) and
  screens can be mirrored with one side showing outline of the doc and the other
  showing everything else.
- Writers, programmers, academicians all praise this software and claim to have
  switched from others because EMACS fucking kills. 
- I am sold!
- I have only scratched the tip of the iceberg I suspect. I want to do much much
  more with it.

There is a whole community, some special metions with creation of
documentation and some interesting modes would be Ian Barton and
Carsten Doiminik.

## Getting started

### Installation basics

Installing from the ubuntu software centre is possible, but for some
reason it didn't install the latest version. I followed the
installation procedure [here][ask-ubuntu-installation]. I am
replecating the infor here.

	$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-elisp/ppa
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot

In case you already installed an older version of emacs use the
following to remove the current running version:

	$ sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove emacs

I ran into [this error][emacs-stack-error-thej] whence I had the old
installation. Maybe it is not necessary to fix do it right away, but
keep it in mind. Many packages including Helm and Markdown-mode didn't work.

### Things to know 

One of the ideas behind emacs is to allow you to write efficiently
without having to do silly key strokes that would involve moving your
entire arm to another location. Bear with the initial discomfort, and
it will pay off. 

We are not going to use the up, down, left, right, delete, home, end
page up buttons when we are in emacs.
