## Goal

I would like to write my resume and cover letter in Emacs. With this
post I want to log what all I did to setup Emacs and how to get Latex
working.

I would I ideally want a pdf on the right (within or not within
Emacs), and left side to have the text.

How to easily install auctex?

How to manage packages within auctex?

How to display the pdf output?

how do make a simple document with hello world.

## Info

>The AUCTeX package provides more advanced features for editing TeX
>and its related formats, including the ability to preview TeX
>equations within Emacs buffers. Unlike BibTeX mode and the RefTeX
>package, AUCTeX is not distributed with Emacs by default.
