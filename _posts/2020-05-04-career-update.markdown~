## It's a wrap

### ETG scene

prolties impact

### EA scene 

prolties, use what my internship recent one.  impact

Generalist Research, CE types?, Data Science, statistics

### Future plan

You have to start somewhere. You can grow into bigger positions: look
at AJLPAL people and all seem to have moved from a research position
to higher. 

Jumping into a DS job, prepping for it. so that I can keep ETG open
for me. Meanwhile I get better in statistics, writing, economics,
poverty stuff etc...

Just write it up. and then identify claims... I am very skeptical
about spending time on DS. I don't care about what people think. I
want to try out something like working on my research skills.

Do we need to keep ETG on the side? What if I don't get a job? that is
why i think i need to have my foot in both places. IF EA is not workin
gout hten I better get the fuck out of here to US. Become "great" in
DS. bro. Let's go.

But of course, if you look at Luke prog, eliezer, they don't have
backup plans, they are just stunningly good I would guess. They odn't
need another job. Another job needs them. there are so many people who
are taking the chance. 

### Biggest fear

### Planning Fallacy


### Other claims to investigate

It is possible to grow to bigger positions... e.g., I have.

People start in research and move to other positions. e.g.,... I have

Research/interns are the only things I can do? in Longtermism and
Global poverty

Program managers can be grown into as well.

Figure out if I have to take the Micro economics course data analysis
for social scientists and designing and running randomized
evaluations. ( This week starts on Jun2 2020. **Important**)
