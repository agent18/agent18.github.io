## Legalization of documents

https://ind.nl/en/Pages/legalisation-and-translation-of-official-documents.aspx

"You need to have official foreign documents legalised. Official
documents are, for example, birth certificates, unmarried status
declarations, marriage certificates or diplomas." **NOT PASSPORTS?**

"If you want to use a document from India in the Netherlands, you must
first have it legalised by the Indian Ministry of External
Affairs. This is done with a special stamp called an apostille."
