## introduction

Last week I have clocked 7 hrs (had some office work and some office
related social stuff I "needed to do" but I still managed to properly
procrastinate in the weekends), Week before that 12 hrs (something
came up in the weekends), week before that 31 hrs and week before that
7 hrs. OK without going into the depth of where all I
procrastinated. All this despite working 32 hours a week
only. Weekends been having some outings, or vacation trip with friends
or someones 30th birthday, or I am hungover etc... all this and a
whole ton of procrastination. There was some distraction or the
other. Nevertheless I know for a fact I have been procrastinating.

I think I feel like shit for doing nothing this sunday, despite being
sane and shit. Woke up late, slept again and did nothing other than
write my email to an STM and setup my degiro account. All in all not
counted for important stuff that I need to do and it's a whole bunch
of waste.

Work includes stuff like prepping for indrews or writing or thinking,
anything outside my 32hrs of work.

This is disgusting. Please pick up your shit Agent18. Let's get back.


Add a line of retreat... It's ok, I will not post this yes. I will fix
it and then post it. Ok? Then there will be no STM judgining the hell
out of me.
