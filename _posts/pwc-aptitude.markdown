**The various components from PWC's email**  

Deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning tests are designed to measure
your ability to draw logical conclusions based on information
provided, identify strengths and weaknesses of arguments, and complete
scenarios using incomplete information.

Numerical reasoning. Your numerical understanding and arithmetic
skills will be tested on the basis of facts and figures in statistical
tables. You will be shown a table or graph, followed by a question
about it.

Inductive reasoning. Here, the questions consist of a series of
figures, the final one of which is unknown. You then have to select
the final figure by discovering the pattern according to which the
figures change. You do that by applying the pattern logically. This
exercise tests your abstract and analytical reasoning capacity.

## Inductive reasoning

**Conclusion** With this you have come to the end of the basics of
figure series. You have learned to follow elements about the four
Figures based on the **size, color, position and orientation**. With
that you have laid the foundation to make good figure sequences.

Tip: While following the element, **say out loud what is**
happening. (small, medium, large, small, medium…. large). The logical
conclusion often follows automatically.

Tip: If you have to choose between two answers. Then **take a good
look at where they differ. That way you quickly discover what to look
for** to rule out the wrong answer.

Tip: **Do not try to check all properties at once,** And rule out
possible answers.


1. Focus on one element,
2. determine what the last position should be,
3. **exclude wrong answers**
4. then start on the next element.

### Summary of the rules

1. General
   1. Look at **color, size, position, orientation**, one at a time
   2. exclude wrong answers and check which item is different in wrong
   answers
   3. **If no simple pattern found look for Interaction**
   
2. **Interaction** (arrow pointing to ball, ball in the place of arrow)
   - **Arrow pointing to ball**
   - ball in place of arrow
   - **1st inner figure is the 2nd inner figure in the next pic**
   - **envelope filling hourglass** (**when things appear RANDOM**)
   - **Clock face arrow as number of sides**
   
3. **Only one item moves and the rest move around it**
   - signal for this is that you see one item stay in the sam place
     for 2-3 runs.
	 
4. Look for Color patters, diagonal pattern, rotation pattern,
   orientation pattern, position pattern **of one item**.
   
5. **things go missing while rotating and while creating new items**

6. **One item staying in the same place and all others moving**

7. **Basics**

	- 2,4,6,8 movement
	- 3,2,1,0 movement
	- **1,3,5,7 movment**
	- top row alone color change pattern
	- **1st hole (1,2,3,4) 2nd hole (2,4,2,4)**
	
8. **Total number of items**, 
   - balls in upper and lower half
   - number of random figures 5, 4, 3, 4, ?(4)

### Complex practice

- Made mistake with pattern Q1: Top, Right, Left, bottom (apparently
  it should be read as 2, 4, 6 and 8 (basically stopping) jumps and
  then restart)
  
  20 questions in 19 mins. could have done it faster by not checking
  wiht another block.
  
- Mistake 2 Q7: Top row always NOT COLORED


**Star mark questions**

- 3
- 7  --> 
- 8  --> 2,4,6,8 movement
- 13 --> 3,2,1,0 movement
- 17 --> top row color change

### Module 2 lesson 1

**69% obtained, expected 90%**

- 8 --> diagonal switching, single item switching (envelope hourglass
  switch), color of envelope (bww, bww)
  
- 14 --> **common mistake I am doing is working on a code which is the same
  in the remaining answers**

- 16 & 18 --> one moves and the rest re-orient

![Q16](../images/shl/mod-2-16.png)

- Q21 --> : All figures rotate counterclockwise . The figure above
  **'disappears'** and the figure at the **bottom left is a random new**
  figure.

![q21](../images/shl/mod-2-21.png)

- Q27 -->  Outer becomes 1 inner, 1 inner becomes innermost
  etc... (only 2 patterns exist here, be careful)
  
  ![Q27](../images/shl/mod-2-27.png)

**Answer E**: The outer one becomes 1 smaller in the next figure, the
middle one also gets 1 smaller in the next figure


- Q28 

**The largest figure in box 1 is the smallest figure in box 3, the
largest figure in box 2 is the smallest in box 4, etc.**

- Q31

**Start with one rule, eliminate the rest and come back to find next rule**

### Module 2 lesson 2

- Q3 not sure if it was bbw bbw or bottom row shabaang

- Q13

![Q13](../images/shl/mod-3-13.png)

**The top cross remains. The other cross moves up and down**

- Q21 Complex interplay between rules, white envelope empites and
  black envelope adds to the hourglass. INTERACTION upon randomness.

![Q21](../images/shl/mod-3-21.png)


- Q22 **When you quickly can't find a pattern there is
  interplay**. Arrow points to the circle and arrow is where the
  circle is next

### Module 3 practice 1

> You got **11 out of 12 questions (91.70%)** correct! You have now

  different paces**)

The recommended score for this quiz is 90% (and your score is 83%
). You can retake this quiz to improve your score.

![q6](../images/shl/mod-prac-2-6.png)

- Q6 Count decreases by -1, -2, -3, 4. I was looking for how the top and
  bottom differed.
  
- Q5 **First see outer to inner next, then see inner to outer next, then
see outer1 to inner3 and so on**

![q5](../images/shl/mod-prac-2-5.png)
### Module 3 practice 3

The recommended score for this quiz is 90% (and your score is 83%
). You can retake this quiz to improve your score.

- Ridiculous excercise q2
 
![q2](../images/shl/mod-prac-3-q2.png)


**too random:** The figure first moves one position clockwise twice. A
new figure is created. From the third figure onwards, the figures
slide into each other again. Therefore only answer C is
logical. However **1,2,3,2,1** is easier and "more logical"
### Module 3 practice 4

### Percentages

**Question** #13: The price of a television first increased by 5% and then
decreased by 5%. By what percentage has the price increased or
decreased in total?

**Explanation**: The price first increases by 5%, so times 1.05. After
that, the price decreases by 5%, so times 0.95.  1.05 x 0.95 = 0.9975
is the new price.  Then the percentage change is: (0.9975 – 1) / 1 x
100 = -0.25%

**Question** #14: The price of a book is 40 euros, the price of a DVD is
52 euros. What percent does the book cost less than the DVD?


**Explanation**: 40/52 = 0.77 So 1 – 0.77 = 0.23 = 23% less

**Question** #20: The price on a Playstation is reduced by 20%. In order
for the turnover to increase by 10%, the quantity must increase by
37.5%.  

**Explanation**: New sales = 110% New price = 80% 1.10 = 0.80 x Quantity
1.10 / 0.80 = 1.375 So the quantity must increase by 37.5%.

**Question** #19: A retailer increases the price of an item by
20%. Moments later, he lowers the price by 20%. Is the price now the
same as before the discount?

Price: 1 x 0.80 x 1.20 = 0.96

### num reas eng solving graphs

Shortcut:

Instead of the new-minus-old method, it can also be: (24/15) – 1 = 0.6
= 60%.

**percentage increase:** new/old -1 instead of (new-old)/old.

**Growth**: old * rate^n


**Question:** The average distance traveled per motorist was 150,000
km 10 years ago. Now that has dropped by 10%. At what percentage has
the total traveled distance in kilometers now changed?

**The number 150,000 is irrelevant**. There is a decrease of 10%. That
means that 150,000 equals 100% (1) and that is now equal to 90% (0.9).

Then you can also calculate (12.6 x 0.90) / 7 – 1 = 0.62.

**Table Question**

What is the biggest percentage increase?

*Look for the highest increase and then look for percentage increase.*


**Base Rate over many years**

BR = (FV/BV)^(1/n) -1, increase in rate

This comes from: BV x (1+ BR)^n = FV

**Speed**

Graph takes 20s before and is not 17% faster.

t1 = 20s, t2 = 20x0.83s = 16.6s (according to shl)

v1 = 1/20 (graph/s)
v2 = 1.17*1/20 = 0.058 g/s

t2 = 17s

**Betty sue and david work 2400sft in 4 hrs**

B + D =  2400 in 4 hrs = 600 in 1 hr. If B is twice as fast as D, then
B --> 400sft in 1 hr and D --> 200sft in 1 hr.

**Cumilative (GP)**

a + axr + axr^2...

a(1-r^n)/(1-r)


## how o I feel about the motivation test?

I think it's very vague. Many times I don't know waht you are talking
about?

"how does this affect your motivation at work?" What do you mean here?
Am I feeling like I can work or am I depressed adn loose focus. More
challenge more focus.

"working in uncomfortable conditions"? Like mentally challenging? or
hot climate? or what?

## How i think I did the test

I answered many questions. Induction was easyish, still there were
those ridiculous new questions with skeleton.

Deductive I was horrible. I skipped a lot of them. Num reasoning it
was ok. Last I left 3-4 questions...

Very doubtful that I am going to get ahead. :( It's ok, we move on.
