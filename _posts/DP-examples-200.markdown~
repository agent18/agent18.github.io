## Mission #5

> automatic)[2]"

You've described [2] using a lovely concrete example. However, [1] is
sorely lacking in examples. What is this "organizing information"? Or
"providing solutions"? That could be anything from "it's hot today"
all the way up to "e = mc^2". Contrast that to PG's [business plan](http://www.paulgraham.com/vwplan.html)
for his startup in 1995:

> OVERVIEW Webgen allows clients to generate web catalogs remotely.
>
> There are several other companies that can generate and serve web
> catalogs. The best known site of this type is Marketplace MCI
> (www.internetmci.com). But while these other sites use their
> generators in-house to build catalogs from materials provided by
> clients, Webgen's generator can be used interactively by anyone with a
> modem and a copy of Netscape. ...

You might want to describe what you're doing in such terms, like
"generate web catalogs remotely" or "used interactively", so that it
clear even to an outsider what you're doing.

I appreciate the fact that you followed the deliberate practice method
rigorously by making notes, setting them aside, and coming back
later. Great work!

* * * * *

Mission #5: Time to chunk it up. Right now, you are working on
sentences and paragraphs at a time. That is, you get feedback about
your output dimensions after writing the entire paragraph (or God
forbid, the entire essay). The feedback isn't immediate enough
(principle #3 from TiO). In contrast, look at how I narrowed down the
specific phrases [1] and [2] where you gave examples or not.

You need to take passages you feel you don't understand clearly
(perhaps some things you've written yourself about important yet
unclear issues in "rationality" and some outside material about tough
technical problems), mark within parentheses each important phrase
like I did with [1] and [2], check if you've given an example for it,
and if not, rewrite it with a concrete example. If you're not sure if
a phrase is important or not, err in favour of an example. 200
repetitions should be a good start. Soon, you will come to notice
immediately if you are throwing out words without any concrete
example, the way a misspelled word in an editor shows up with red
underlines.

Does it mean that PG and EY will give examples after every phrase? Not
necessarily. But they will have an example in mind as they write. I
suspect that when we say "people don't think clearly", we mean that
their words don't correspond to any concrete example (see: "critical
thinking"). And when your words don't correspond to anything concrete,
you can make them say anything. For a striking example, check out this
philosophical passage that EY tore to pieces:
https://youtu.be/D6peN9LiTWA?t=1067

What was the problem there? The words didn't correspond to any known
piece of reality. They were figments of the poet's imagination, and
yet he thought they described something real. It sounded convincing
even to me. I was like, yeah, maybe we really are fallen people
compared to those wise, brotherly ancients.

How would you and I tackle that? We would stop at the first phrase in
the first sentence: "In the age when life on Earth was full". Ok. Give
me a historical example or empirical evidence for what you mean by
"life on Earth was full". People had ACs? Cars? Long lives? Lots of
sex? (Could be true. Could also be not true. Need empirical
evidence. And if you say you can't get that evidence from millenia
ago... well, that's the whole point! Why are you using as an example
something that you have no real evidence about? End of story then and
there.)

Let's take another example closer to home. "I need to practice
critical thinking and become a master." - Anonymous, 1785 AD. Well,
Mr. Anonymous, what is this "critical thinking" you speak of? Let's
see at least one example (after you've practiced on a bunch of other
sentences).

## Translating Mission to my understanding

- Somehow it is important that we write as many examples as we can. 

- why because words are pointless they don't drive home the meaning to
  you! The difference is very clear. For example as in the mission
  statement, you see how I talked about one particular aspect of DP,
  which was that the delivery always will be controlled conscious and
  non-automatic, aka, no direct consistancy. The example of that seems
  to be tiger woods stopping mid shot because a fucking bird shadow
  appeared behind him, or that someone heckled. 
  
  Apparently you don't get better (like in car driving, or typing). if
  you leave the progress to automation or unconcious consistency, you
  will never grow or become better. But we are in the world of getting
  crazy ass skill (like what mother fucker?), like becoming better at
  critical thinking (still fluff), like solving problems that are
  important to the world like eradicating poverty, all this requires
  problem solving capabilities and that is precisely what we want.
  
  So the goal as an stm pointed out a few missions back is that words
  are fluff, they mean nothing unless they are associated with an
  example. What is the impact of this and in what content will be
  talked about later. For now we stick with the mission and maximize
  the points for this mission.
  
  
- What is expected ?

There was a complaint in the last essay from me, that things were
boring while doing the essay. Or that it was a bit easy. I didn't feel
burned down. My conclusion was the time allocated.

But an STM seems to think it was the lack of immediate feedback. While
doing DP, first I need to make some notes then write a my version and
then check against certain dimensions what needs to be done. This
overall is quite a long process, where the actual dp is 1/3rd of the
time I spend on the rest of the post.

- Side note

In the last essay I had come to the conclusion that I needed to get
also get back to what the hell was the whole point of this aka, what
do we want to improve? critical thinking, what do you mean by that!

## The rules of DP (how it looks)

1. It’s designed specifically to improve performance.

2. It can be repeated a lot

3. mentally painful

4. feedback

There are three types of DP... which..

Goal: Every sentence cannot have fluff, the sentence should mean
something to you, it just can't be, "critical thinker with an ability
to move people working towards a common greater goal for life". I will
beat you rascal!

Maybe something from the dynamics course, would be a fun addition to
add here, especially the part of the virtual work. but maybe it is a
problem for getting written. 

Or someother technical work

Critical thinking .org is rife with 0 examples about how to go about things.


## Starting somewhere


**Mission**: You need to take passages you feel you don't understand clearly
(perhaps some things you've written yourself about important yet
unclear issues in "rationality" and some outside material about tough
technical problems), mark within parentheses each important phrase
like I did with [1] and [2], check if you've given an example for it,
and if not, rewrite it with a concrete example. If you're not sure if
a phrase is important or not, err in favour of an example. 200
repetitions should be a good start. 



**Goal**: For me the goal , as an STM pointed out, to not have fuzzy words,
everything shall be associated with an clear real example. This is it. 

So we need to identify the important phrases using paranthesis and
then suggest if they have examples or not and then provide examples
where they aren't there.

This is not really the BF method, but one where I am improving the
skill of identifying and giving examples and improving my thinking in
terms of examples.

Mark important phrases withing parenthesis and check if there is an
example otherwise rewrite it.

### What is and isn't DP

From [my summary on TIO about 'What is and isn't DP'](/DP-CT-examples.html):

> Sometimes I go to basketball practice and try a few shots from one
> spot. Then I try (some drills in ball handling)[1] to (improve play
> during the game)[2]. I try (multiple variations)[3] 2-3 times each and
> get bored and then play some one-on-ones with someone and feel happy
> that I have clocked 2 more hours of practice (that hopefully gets me
> to amazing levels someday)[4]; you know, ‘Practice makes perfect’ and
> the like. The author hosts a similar example from his life when he
> went golfing and (“practiced” with golf balls)[5]. He says with
> conviction that (this will do jack shit to your performance)[6].


**Rule #1:** [1...6] have been identified as the parts that do not
have any examples. Some things that stand out for me is the lack of
examples for "gets me to amazing levels someday"[4]. I have no idea
what it means, I am thinking of a few people but I guess it helps to
put it in words.


**Rule #2:** The rewrite is as follows:

So every Sunday I play basketball with my friends. Mostly I suck and
people make fun of it, especially when you make air balls or miss a
silly ass layup when you are so close to the basket. Whilst this is
me, my friends, almost all of them, have very good shooting percentage
and good range from where they can shoot. I would like to be atleast
as good as them [2]. In order to become better (become atleast as good
as them), I go to the court on Saturdays and "practice". (I start with
shooting from different places randomly (roughly 20 shots) and then
try 5 spin moves, and then move on to left handed layups)[3] and
continue something like this for about 2 hrs and (feel happy that I am
going to be as good as my friends in a year or two)[4]. At no point
did I consider feedback, in terms of shot percentage or if my form was
different every time, if I need to shoot higher or farther, what angle
should I release the ball in etc... The author of the book hosts a
similar example of how he "practiced" with golf balls. (So, he was
hitting a few 100 balls)[5]. That's it. He didn't make any note or
consciously give him feedback about how much power he needs to give
and what angle he needs to hit the ball, and where he needs to hit the
ball. The author says with conviction that this practice will not
improve the performance noticeably, i.e. (you will NEVER be better
than your peers)[6], ever.

**Rule #1:** Except [6] none of them seem to have an example
associated with it. Although they are explained in the coming
sections, it would still be useful to see them in one or two
examples just like in [6].

**Rule #2:** The rewrite is as follows:

Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
examining. It is activity designed (specifically to improve
performance)[1], often with a teacher’s help; (it can be repeated a
lot)[2]; (feedback on results is continuously available)[3]; (it’s
highly demanding mentally)[4], (whether the activity is purely
intellectual, such as chess or business-related activities)[5], or
(heavily physical, such as sports;)[6] and (it isn’t much fun)[7].

You want to be a better basket ball player. How do you do that? You
first need to identify spaces where you suck, example, shooting, lay
ups, ballhandling, passing, court vision, team playing etc... Lets for
now say we want to improve shooting, we need to design an activity
that will specifically improve that. We saw earlier how I had designed
an activity to improve shooting. I shot from random places, and did
less than 20 shots and moved on to something else. That is surely
designed by me but not to improve performance. The design should be
such that it actually improves your performance. There is a huge body
of knowledge about the mechanics, the form and the way to do the
practice, which is available and usually works better in the presence
of a teacher as sometimes you are not able to see your own
problems. Initially I never realised that I was shooting with all
sorts of forms. Everytime I shot it was different. This was pointed
to me by my teacher and I have been working on maintaining form.

So when you practice, you need to have feedback continuously. So for
example, when I am practicing shooting, I look at the parameter of
shooting percentage and log it every week when I practice. So I know
if I am getting better or if I suck, so I can take some additional
step to keep improving. In addition I train with a friend who gives me
critical feedback, laughs at me when I suck. So, Feedback.

It can be repeated a lot. The pathetic practice I had designed earlier
seriously missed out on this. I shot 20 times from different
places. Instead I should shot 20-100 times from the same place over
and over again.

It's highly demanding mentally. It is quite a mental load to
practice. You are physically tired and you still need to keep
grinding. Yesterday I was practicing this spin move and wanted to do
it 20 times. By the 10th time, I felt like I wanted to stop, but I
needed to keep grinding. So I had to push myself to do more. I was
practicing some shooting and I was sucking so hard, but I still needed
to keep grinding over all the negativity. I have put in so much hard
work over the last many weeks and the extent to which I sucked was
incredible. I was tired, my arms cound't do it and I forced myself to
do those 100 shots from close to the 3-point-line. This is what I
think of when something is mentally demanding.

It isn't much fun. It is nice to see that you are improving, but the
improvement is so slow. If I could I would never want to practice, I
just like playing the games. But then you suck at the game, when you
don't practice. And you need to push your self more than you are
capable of, i.e, make 20 spin moves even though you are getting
breathless at the end of 10.


You need to push yourself, you need to keep at it for many
many many weeks before you see little progress. Somedays you try so
much but you still are not good enough, you still need to keep at it
with the focus on the larger goal.

**Rule #1:** It looks like [2-10] highlighted statements need
'example' explanations.


**Rule #2:** The re-write is as follows.

During DP, one must identify certain sharlpy defined elements like
shooting or spin moves in basketball, that need improvement [2] and
work on them intently like [Kobe Bryant the legend](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/kobe-bryant-story-jay-williams-playoff-workout/2/) who quits
practicing only [after he makes 400 shots](https://www.businessinsider.nl/kobe-bryant-insane-work-ethic-2013-8/?international=true&r=US) (around 3 hrs of only
shooting)[3]. These practices should be designed in such a way that
they stretch your current abilities, like Jerry Rice's practice
regimen in the off season, where he would literally be training the
whole day so that his conditioning is improving during the
games[4]. The great performers, see a couple of issues and isolate
each one of them. Benjamin Franklin understood from his father that
his work stinks. His father pointed out a few of his flaws. One of the
issues was that he had poor vocabulary, so he designed his practice
only and just for that [5]. He found the best work, made notes on it,
a few days later he would make his own version and compare it to
original. You would work on it until you see sufficient improvement
before moving on to the next aspect. So in basketball, currently I
would be happy if I reached 60% shooting percentage every week in
practice before adding other aspects to my practice, such as shooting
when there is a defender etc...[6,7]

It is recommended by the author that the practices are done with the
guidance of a teacher. In case we think that we have outgrown the
benefits of a teacher, the author suggest to atleast give it another
thought. The benefits of having a teacher cannot be stressed
enough. But for the things we are working on it might either not be
possible or too pricy to have our own teacher. Nevertheless Ben
Franklin's teacher was the writings of Spectator, some work that is
clearly of a higher class than what you are capable of doing [8].

While learning, it is ideal to be in the zone where we are just beyond
our comfort zone which makes us stretch our abilities. I get easily
gased out when I make a run or follow a defender. And it is important
to be better than the other player to outrun him. To prep for this, it
might be a good idea to do interval training at the gym on the
treadmill or biking. The stat that I use to check the performance of
the day is average-heart-rate. I know what I AHR I can reach easily
161bpm over 20 mins. If I stick to that every day there will be no
improvement. I need to push myself to a much higher AHR. So I give
myself a goal that will be much harder to achieve 175bpm, so much so
that the last 2 mins will be hell. For sure setting a goal for AHR to
be 175 BPM is pushing it way too much. But 165 bpm already is
challenging enough and just outside my comfort zone. If I really
wanted to train to be the best of the best of the best, I should be
going for 175bpm, but it drastically tones down the motivation and it
becemes such a daunting task. [9..11]

**Rule #1:** It looks like [5] is only one has examples.


**Rule #2:** re-writing...

Following all this, one can work on his technique but it is very
important to see progress and get feedback, such as if you are able to
lift more weight than the last time you went to the gym [1]. Otherwise
one will stop getting any better and stop caring about the end goal
[2]. Feedback is extremely crucial to feel motivated[3]. For instance,
I mainly care about how well I do on the sunday games. Based on how I
suck or where all I suck, I work on them the next week saturday. But
without the Sunday Games I am nothing. The Sunday games give me the
ultimate true feedback about if I suck or not and gives me the real
motivation to get back on saturday to practice. There was a time when
for 3 weeks I didn't really play on Sunday, and I felt it was quite
hard to come to practice, I was even contemplating not going to the
gym [2,3]. Feedback is king.

Sometimes results might need interpretation [4] and trusting your own
judgment might not really be the best way to go about it [5]. Its easy
to fool yourself that you played "well" today. If you scored the last
basket, you usually feel good. For a better understanding of how well
you actually performed, you need to look at some sort of statistics
like how many points you scored per game or what was your field goal
percentage [4,5]. Is the blog post clear to a new reader? Will people
get the main idea? Is it organized well? Paul Graham for example,
appears to take this very seriously. Before he publishes a post, he
runs atleast a few loops of getting feedback from his friends followed
by correction before publishing it.

**Rule #1:**



**Rule #2:**

It is painful, it is a mental strain. It is not fun. Today as I am
making this exercise, it is hard. Generating examples of all kinds,
knowing that I might not really make the goal of 200, and pushing
myself to still make it is all the strain mentally. It cannot be fun,
when you are pushing yourself to be something much much more than you
are capable of. Grinding for about 6 solid hrs is quite hard. The
violinist's from Ericsson's experiment stated that practice was the
least fun activity in their daily life.

Everyone would achieve greatness if it were easy and fun. But everyone
doesn't and it is not easy and fun. Your willingness to do it will
distinguish you all the more from the rest. Aamir Khan for a movie
makes a [ridiculous transformation in short time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aVw1gZ9Ncg). It was not easy
or fun as you can see from the video. He is constantly made to push
beyond what he is capable of. He struggles with doing it everyday, but
pushes himself anyway. His willingness, the mental struggle he had to
go through to do what he did distinguishes him all the more from the
rest just like Jerry Rice. How many Jerry Rice's and Aamir Khan's do
we know of? [4].

**Rule #2:** re-writing...


These tasks whether physical or not -such as improving physical
conditioning or playing the piano [1] -seem to drain out much of our
mental energy -as seen with Jerry Rice's conditioning or the
Ericsson's experiment of the pianists playing pieces[2,3] - as they
are all about improving an unsatisfactory performance and trying your
hardest to improve them. 

It is estimated that 4-5 hrs of DP per day seems to be the upper
limit, across disciplines (be in body building or playing the piano)[4],
with sessions lasting no more than 90 minutes. The study of violinists
are for example shows that the kids that do DP slept more not only
during the night but also during the afternoons.

There is way too much vagueness in this paragraph and the coming
paragraphs.


**Rule #1**: [1,2,3,4,5] are in my opinion important phrases. They are
extremely vague and also, none of them have examples. All the 5 points
seem to be talking about some sort of (thinking that is good)[] and
some sort of (thinking that is bad)[]. Giving examples about these
seem to be objective #1.

> Sound thinking, skilled thinking, good thinking, IS GOOD

The perfect AI, thinking free of biases, thinking clearly with focus
of the goal and only the goal, thinking that is not confused:

There has been quite some evidence that a girl is not so interested in
me, and yet I discard all that evidence and continue talking to her as
though nothing has happened. I am positive she is [keeping me
around](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2769593/HALF-women-fall-partner-standby-fancied-case-current-relationship-turns-sour.html), but yet I ignore every sensible option I have in my life,
so much so to forget the real purpose of my life, which is to earn a
lot of money and give and make some decisions that might not be fully
favorable.

So Sound thinking would be to go to another city that might allow to
improve chances of networking.

If the reason you go all the way to groningen is to have fun, meet
your friends after a long time, smoke some weed, yeah no problem, but
if you feel that *you have to do something for the newyear* and act on
it, despite the fact that you know that it is social proof that is
making you act like this then it is not an example of sound thinking.

Once I was expected to inform if the Vacuum chamber was able to go to
low pressures. I did some experiments and saw that the in some cases
it went to the expected low pressures and in other cases the leak was
too high. I was expected to present this, along with why I think it
was happening, how to verify my claim and also deliver solutions for
the problem. So I looked at the observations and failed to tell a
convincing story (logical) about why we were observing certain
phenomenon. I felt quite confused while making the presentation, and
naturally it showed in the review. I want to be better at solving
problems, or understanding observations, making hypothesis and
eliminating in a systematic way the hypothesis that dont work and
present my findings in an understandable manner to a 3rd person!

An example of good thinking would be knowing that you need to give
money to charity and giving that money to charity instead of spending
that money on an Xbox or a pricy vacation to India.



The rules of drama are simple, if you engage in it, you will be
consumed by it. A senior colleague of mine once shouted at me for
having kept a plate in a particular place in the canteen, I argued
with him as it was none of his business. But in the end he said I
can't do it because he says so. I was fucking furious, I was consumed
in Drama, I was thinking of revenge plots against him, I was thinking
about making some jokes on him and putting it on the web, but all this
would only further the conflict and you guys will have to work with
each other in the future as well. It's just not pleasent to even walk
around as your eyes will meet and you will have to ignore. So you
decide to apologise and ask him how to settle this instead of allowing
it to consume you and him and decrease the overall productivity, and
he immediately says something that works for both. DONE! When you know
being consumed is drama is the worst thing that can happen to you,
letting your ego down a bit doesn't hurt seems like a way of good
thinking.



> Poor thinking is bad (wastes time and energy, engenders frustration
> and pain, and causes other problems)

**Rule #2**: I think the whole thing needs re-writing. This is going

We all know we need to think well, but what does it actually mean? For
example, we have a problem and we want to solve it. If your thinking
can achieve this in reasonable time, then it is good. 

Oh my god this is harder than I thought. No wonder they stuck to being
vague. Being vague is easy. Conveying nothing is easy, just like how I
am doing here.

So I am thinking you have a problem, and you know good ways to solve
it and you don't fall prey to bad thinking practices. For example,

## feedback

First day - lot of yawning. While identifying paragraphs to be worked
on and identifying sentences that need example.

Just identifying was boring max, a bit painful, lot of yawning and
mighty tendencies to get in shape 

I think you need to keep typing, or do work related to that. When I
found out the sentences and tried making examples (# the real hard
work, I am feeling it)

feb 9the 18 hrs: The last one hr was alright! hard, not too intense, I didn't sweat but
making exampels is a biaaaatch

Day 2:

Managed 2*1.5 hr sessions roughly. But quite daunting. thinking of
examples and explaining them is hard. Plus my goal of 200 phrases
could be very hard! I am currently averaging about 10 examples in 1.5 hrs.
