In a post looked at earlier, [MBA](/mba.html), we had a look at what an MBA
means and we look at different universities where it would be
possible to do an MBA.

I don't have money and I don't want to gamble with what I have right
now, or what I could possibly save. 

I would like a scholarship at a great university, which would properl
me to great heights there after. 


## Plan

- Look at top universities
- Look at students who have done an MBA with scholarship and their
  past
- See what I can find online

but ultimately, what will get me into top uni's and how?
