#### Design rules connecting the value system to "reality"

We have a true value system, and a set of design rules, that help us compute the reality cheaply[[Citation needed][]]. The brain can be imagined as a computer with a ram and storage. Given an infinite ram (computational capability) within an infinitely large storage, it should be  possible to compute what will happen at a given moment in the future in this world, based upon physics of the universe and an initial condition. But we don't have such infinite ram to make those costly but True computations. In an attempt to bypass such complex computations, in a "conservative manner", we have some design rules.

When designing machines, we use rules of thumb. This is primarily to increase speed at which designs are done, without loosing too much cost. For example, if we have a thread, the mating surface will automatically have 0.5mm diameter higher hole than the thread diameter. As designers we don't need to every time, spend resources on deciding what type of mating-hole diameter we should use. By doing this, there is literally no increase in costs at all. We just save a lot of man hrs. Similarly, within our body, we have such rules of thumb (design rules); 'Sugar Urge' and 'Social proof' are some of them.

Sugary foods such as apples, oranges and other fruits are rich in vitamins. Instead of making calculations into the future regarding availability of fruits, the evolution just decided to keep a very high threshold on sugary products, as there was [no way of overeating it in the bygone days][sugar].<!-- The design rules were made in the stone age and haven't been updated to be relevant in the recent times[[Citation needed][]]. If we strictly listen to our urge and eat a lot donuts as a result we are sure to have [problems][sugar]. -->

Another example of design rule is social proof.

>Social proof, also known as informational social influence, is a psychological phenomenon where people assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior for a given situation. This effect is prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate mode of behavior, and is driven by the assumption that surrounding people possess more knowledge about the situation.

<!--If you look at the festival of Deewali in India, it feels great to participate in bursting crackers, only when everyone else is bursting crackers, not a month earlier or later for example. In a football stadium it feels great to chant stuff not just by yourself, but when others several others do it, and you do it along with them.
