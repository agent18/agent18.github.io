## First impressions

I am in my prime (26-30) and I think I can work more and as a result
gain more out of prime that I have. Management Consulting seems to be
fast paced. 

[80k hours suggests](https://80000hours.org/career-quiz/#/quantitative=yes&verbalAndSocial=yes&riskTolerance=no&challengeTolerance=yes&careerStage=early&pathType=directImpact%252C+advocacy%252C+earningToGive%252C+research) had rated 'management consulting' for me as
the best option. 

I like the idea of consulting and the associated hype of earning a lot
with the possibility of earning in lower millions if I work at the best
firms. It seems fast paced and I am not fully sure if I can stand to
its tests of working a lot, but I suspect that I can. 

It requires long hours of work and initially will require >60 hrs per week.

## Diving into the details

Skills obtainable: problem-solving, presentation, some analytics

Connections: Not sure, but should be good.

Credentials: Sucess appears to be tangible just like in DS, i.e., it
should be possible to explain to future employers why I am good.

Runway: Doesn't seem to be a problem, as this is possibly one of the
highest paid jobs. But paying for an MBA would

[David goldberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjonathangoldberg/), the ceo of founders pledge has an Mphil in
philosophy. His career is really interesting as he done quite some
founding, being in top psitions (General manager, Co-founder), and
all this without an MBA.

accomplishments, all with a masters degree in philosophy and wihtout
an MBA.

To me the need for an MBA to found companies, to be able to killer
problem-solve seems not really necessary.

## known paths

At the start

Work in consulting for a few years and then 

- go for an MBA

## Things I am unsure of

How much will **I** get paid at start, after MBA, and is it easy to
earn in the lower millions?

Do companies sponsor doing an MBA?

Is doing the MBA same everywhere?

what about MBA in part-time?
