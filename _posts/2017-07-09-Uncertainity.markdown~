In [focus your uncertainity][ele_focus], Eliezer talks about a novice tv reporter who has to come up with excuses in advance for 3 scenarios, but he has limitedd time. How would you go about it, as this is not like school where in you have clear numbers to deal with.

Eleizer doesn't really get into how to solve the problem with this essay.

>Well written, but I guess we don't have many folk here who object to the concept of subjective probability   
-[Robin Hanson in the comments][ele_focus]
