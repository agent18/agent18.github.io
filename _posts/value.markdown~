I would like to figure out what I should be doing, i.e., to go behind determining a value system?
or to just be as I am
or kill myself.

In order to do that, I first gather that I have conflicting views. Views that keep changing all the time. Views that seem to not make sense (ex: Scope sensitivity). It appears that I don't know what I want? and Even if I want something, I don't know if I really want it. So lets start to write again.


#### Conflicting views

Everytime I watch a PETA video or a video from allepo about the disastrous state the world is in, especially and most likely only ones where people are getting injured, such that the emotional quotient is high for me, I cry. I weep like a bitch. This is approximately 0.0000001% of my time in a day when I happen to, by chance come across a video with such characteristics. But everytime it happens, it bites me to bits, and lasts only for a few seconds after. After that, I am mostly just working, getting paid for that work. I come back home from work, wonder what I am doing in life, while I watch other people hanging out with women and friends, while I just go home and not be a part of such "Cool" activities. I feel sad :(.

On other days, there is gym, Man what a place to be. There is sports, Man this is life etc...

Another day, you watch some [not-so-random guy come on the tube][martin] and talk about [happiology][martin_ted], and says most  activities we do are pleasurable, only activities that give you meaning and activities that focus on your doing something bigger than you will get you lasting happiness. Things like say, being in the "service of GOD", or being in the servitude for people (BATMAN, Gandhi), or the like. You mull this over, maybe this is what you want to do and then what happens? Back to the fucking grind.

Another day, you see a video by [Peter singer][] and then weep your fucking balls off, shocked at the extent to which people are willing to go to save people they have no idea about and you share that video with friends. "And then?" you ask? Well, Back to the fucking grind.

So can we come to a consensus that it is really unclear **what I want to do**. But somehow I end up doing the same thing over and over again. I cry, don't take action, just sit around and wonder whats the use of all this?

Should I maybe do something about it?

Get to the bottom of it maybe

Well!

#### Feelings and wants the connection
We seem to have wants; Wants sucha as 'I want food', 'I want a girlfriend', 'I want a social life' etc. We want some wants more than the others, We choose one over the other based on the fact as to how we feel towards something. Based on the where we are, who we are around, time of day etc., we want some things more than others. Like for example, **NOW** I see there is a sick want to get girlfriends despite the fact that there are other things to do as there are so many millions of people suffering. But **if I am in a situation** where there is one person dying and I need to give up the only time I actually get laid in my life, well I guess I would. And **I am in such a situation now**, millions of people are dying, and I am busy thinking looking at facebook and youtube, when I am actively supposed to be generating money and pumping it for 

How many people am I supposed to save? how much is the value of a human life to me? is absolutely unclear. Feelings give me some input but they appear to not scale well, they appear to be circular as seen above. Based on the way a situation is looked at, it gives different answers. Below I would like to give examples of the following, that question the ability of feelings to help me realize what I want.

Now take this for example. 
>Other recent research shows similar results. Two Israeli psychologists asked people to contribute to a costly life-saving treatment. They could offer that contribution to a group of eight sick children, or to an individual child selected from the group. The target amount needed to save the child (or children) was the same in both cases. Contributions to individual group members far outweighed the contributions to the entire group.

With this study almost everything is the same, its only the number of people needed for treatment that varies. The bigger assumption is that all humans have the same value system [[citation needed][]] and that we can see the behaviour that we might exhibit as well. 

As Eleizer puts it in his [blog][], how can it be that 1,312,433,101 happy children is significantly better than 1,312,433,100 happy children, but then somewhat worse to have 1,312,433,108 happy children?

The contribution for the individual child far outweighed the contribution to the entire group. All children are the same to us. We don't know them, we just see the donation posting online. the individual child is theoretically the same to us as any other child from the group. Let's take the first child from the group and compare him to the individual child. Both are theoretically supposed to be the same, i.e., be valued the same. But somehow, it appears that the outcome, i.e., money received per child is atleast 8 times smaller in the case of the group. What doesn't make sense is that the value of the every child in the group, was worth less to the contributors merely by the presense of some other children. As eleizer asks, how can the value of a child go down significantly, just because he is standing next to a few other people. 

If the individual child got X$ and the group also got X$ maybe someone can come and give some reason like people want to give their limited money to a cause and they gave X$ to any cause, irrespective of the number. But apparently the individual contributions far outweighed the contributions of the group, despite both groups having the same target amount.

Frankly I am not fully convinced of the point made by Eliezer based on this study. The study and elizer seem to be pointing out that the brain is wrong in the output it produces.

Well frankly there is no denying that something is terribly wrong when 1,312,433,101 happy children is significantly better than 1,312,433,100 happy children, but then somewhat worse to have 1,312,433,108 happy children. This statement seems to be the key. If someone says that thats how the eqution is written, I guess we can chuck that argument, because, the brain clearly doesn't understand large numbers. If you tell two groups that there are 100,00 people or 100,000,000 people respectively, both the groups would beleive it, as we have no way of imagining or differentiating between the two. i.e., we don't understand numbers of such a scale. We can't imagine the difference, other than that it is somehow "much larger". For the study, we are talking in billions and adding that with 8 or 1. Looking at all the hueristics and biases, the stupid decisions that people make, I think it would be really unwise to conclude that somehow 1,312,433,108 happy children are less worthy of having in this world as opposed to 1,312,433,101 happy children.

I am tempted to say that it makes sense. I am tempted to say that we probably want to donate to a cause rather than what is in the cause. I want to say that we probably want to donate to only one thing and pretty much the same amount. This could be a hypothesis. Looking at it from an evolutionary stand point and considering the tribal stone age mentality, it appears that the analogous situation to this is saving 1 person from the tribe and saving 8 people from the tribe. Can't imagine why someone would help the only the induvidual as much and not help the group so much. 

But Why is there such a value system? 
An explanation that the emotional arousal

In some places it is straight forward, that it is hard to make certain calculations, unless we can point numbers at them as sometimes we cant just make a decision. Will you save your mother or father? But lets say we are not faced with such situations everyday.: 

Cicular altruism people exampls

#### How stupid is your brian?

There are countless exmples as seen in teh above two sections that show us how poor our system of understanding things are, and rather, how our hueristics and biases work. We come to different solutions based on the way we are asked. Emotional arousal seems to play a large part in our lifes.

A human has Wants to guide him to the truth: True or false

It appears taht it might not be true. 

A study was conducted by 

Its not clear for me what I want! Whether I want to help people more than any other thing in the world, even girls! Gasp!

If what I want is informed to me by my how I feel about it, then there seems to be problem. For example if you look here, it is clear, that at a our 

For example a study shows that donations for one person ousted the donations for a group of 8 other people by a large number. 

#### Feelings reflecting wants

We saw earlier that it appears that feelings tell us which want we want. However these feelings are sometimes circular, so we dont know what we really want. As eleizer put it, we can say look at this shit and say that it reveals some deep moral truth regarding ourselves, but then what are the odds. 

Feelings are sometimes circular. We dont understand numbers; For example, when we look at the fact that we cant differentiate between 100 and 200. The hueristics and biases that we have can be brought out in examples, along with the harm that they can cause if we blindly follow them; For example, we all have this sugar urge, that is quite dangerous to our health. this sugar urge is a hueristic of the bygone days, where in there was no way of overeating sugar and the hueristic developed was simple such that the maximum threshold for eating of sugar products was extremely high. Hueristics seem like guiding blocks. It has been identified that the sugar urge probably was the reason to maximize our intake of high vitamin sources such as fruits.


#### Feelings(intuition) as only direction pointers
Eleizer in his post on [The "Intuitions" Behind "Utilitarianism"][] says that 

>I see the project of morality as a project of renormalizing intuition.  We have intuitions about things that seem desirable or undesirable, intuitions about actions that are right or wrong, intuitions about how to resolve conflicting intuitions, intuitions about how to systematize specific intuitions into general principles.

>Delete all the intuitions, and you aren't left with an ideal philosopher of perfect emptiness, you're left with a rock.

>Keep all your specific intuitions and refuse to build upon the reflective ones, and you aren't left with an ideal philosopher of perfect spontaneity and genuineness, you're left with a grunting caveperson running in circles, due to cyclical preferences and similar inconsistencies.

>"Intuition", as a term of art, is not a curse word when it comes to morality - there is nothing else to argue from.  Even modus ponens is an "intuition" in this sense - it's just that modus ponens still seems like a good idea after being formalized, reflected on, extrapolated out to see if it has sensible consequences, etcetera.


#### Feelings(intuition) as only direction pointe (Options)

You see that your feelings are untrustable as they are giving you circular results in many places ( in cases), in someplaces they are outright wrong (sugar urge). But then we also see that feelings is the only thing we have. Apparently even Modus ponens follows from feelings/intuition, 

>the rule of logic which states that if a conditional statement (‘if p then q ’) is accepted, and the antecedent ( p ) holds, then the consequent ( q ) may be inferred.

At this point yes I did start clubbing feelings and intuition together. " I feel that modes ponens is right". Everything seems to be ultimately a feeling or rather, something that makes me feel like something is right or wrong, something I should be doing on not.

Often times I have thought of questioning my current thought process, but I refrained from it. I can't start at questioning my very thought process right now. Then I am gone! Where will I even begin then. It's one thing that I have been avoiding all along. The one tool I would continue to use and question only later is my current reasoning capability. Maybe this is it. You have to use this faulty system, to repair the faulty system. This is how far you can get with this faulty system. You think with the faulty system as Eleizer says, else you become no different than a rock. When you remove all your feelings, you don't become an ideal philosopher of perfect emptiness, you just become a rock. When you are  empty as an ideal philosopher and reject every feeling you have, (which seems like the direction to go), where will you go, what will you do?

As Eleizer says in the [same post][], 

>But what do you do anyway?

Eleizer further elborates and I seem to agree with him on this part that, if you stick to intuition/feeling, your view will be fucked because of all the things we saw earlier. Mainly circular logic, hueristics not capable of handling the complexities of current society. Inability to make killer judgements that will be right.

But if you dont use feelings, then you are just empty.

But then there seems to be a ~middle ground~ another option, wherein you reflect on intuitions, extrapolate to see if it makes "sensible consequences" etc...

Elieser in his post on [Why truth][] also says something on those lines.

>The obvious choice isn’t always the best choice, but sometimes, by golly, it is. I don’t stop looking as soon I find an obvious answer, but if I go on looking, and the obvious-seeming answer still seems obvious, I don’t feel guilty about keeping it. Oh, sure, everyone thinks two plus two is four, everyone says two plus two is four, and in the mere mundane drudgery of everyday life everyone behaves as if two plus two is four, but what does two plus two really, ultimately equal? As near as I can figure, four.

As far as I can figure out 2+2 gives 4. The idea being if you have 2 unreacting stones, side by side along with 2 more of them, in total you should have 4 and not 3 for example. 

If you remove the feelings, there is no you. You just become a rock. If you fully iuse only your intuitions you are no differnet from a cavman.

But how do you know what feelings are right?

How do you know modus ponens is right?
>"Intuition", as a term of art, is not a curse word when it comes to morality - there is nothing else to argue from.  Even modus ponens is an "intuition" in this sense - it's just that modus ponens still seems like a good idea after being formalized, reflected on, extrapolated out to see if it has sensible consequences, etcetera.

> The snow is white if and only if the snow is white

How do you know what feelings are right? 
We take every intuition we have, reflect upon it, extrapolate to see if it has sensible consequences.

Take the intuition wherein you want to save the life of a child who is dying right now, right next to you, who got run over by van. You very well know that you have to pay 10k right now and you won't get it back. But what I just said was hypothetical, whereas in real life, there are millions of children dying. Your intuition wanted to save the dying child now, so you should be atleast saving one child now although the emotional quotient is high?

Well should I just ask my self from within, and get the answer that is best suited? So should I just question myself asking, why it makes a difference if the person is next to me or not. It's a helpless child, why am I calculating what I feel into the picture? when I want that child to be alive?

My second intuition could be right and I have to extrapolate the intuition to the first...

Well you feel too stongly against this?

You also feel too strongly against going shopping should you?
But its just shopping. how can you compare that with saving a life? 

I still cant make sense of the reaonsing I am providing myself regarding this.. I need to define I feel like, something consistant and then go by it. not keep making excuses as they come up. Make the hypothesis before testing it?

our brain has some shortcomings, it can't naturally multiply, it can't naturally compare different situations.



#### What I am worried about

Prejudice!



But now I have already discussed this with my friend, a million times and seen enough footage online, that nowadays, I cry for everything. I cry for every scene in batman, Gandhi! I just need to think of it and bam! Water falls! The point I am trying to make is I am convinced on some level, and I don't want my prejudice to guide me to the answer! But maybe you cant help it or maybe you cam. 
My intuition re
garding saving people is lets say X. and then I feel I want to conclude and this is over. But no, I am afraid, that I already "know the answer" and I might make

Eleizer says, bro, you don't stop looking for an answer once you think something is or feel something is. but then despite further reasoning, observation, rational thought, if it still appears to stay the same then ok!

Lets do the first question we did now with the new reasoning abilities we have gained?


Science can always look at Hueristics and biases are always there to probably tell you better. Better how?


#### The same question

An induvidual child gets significantly more funds than a group of 8 children despite the target group being the same. 

How can it be significantly more better to have 1,312,44
#### How am I different from a terrorist?

A terrorist knows with all his heart that he is going to take his life and kill serveral others, to put the fear of god in people. That is most important to him. Why is he brainwahsed and not me?




If this is the case, then it can be imagined

I have 200 $ and I can spend it on a trivium concert or I can send it to Give Well and probably contribute to saving 



It seems not too hard to imagine someone keeping a person at gunpoint, and threatening you to give up your 60k TV that you just bought, so you can save this mans life. Will you do it? Of course you will. 


Wants seem to be divided into things that are primal, secondary, tertiary and so on. Primary wants would be, 'I want food', 'I want girlfriends', 'I want a social life', 'I want to keep warm', 'I want my people to live', 'I want to live' and the like...

We want some wants more than others. These wants, also vary based on other factors and as a result change with time. Like for example, **NOW** I see there is a sick want to get girlfriends despite the fact that there are other things to do as there are so many millions of people suffering. But **if I am in a situation** where there is one person dying and I need to give up the only time I actually get laid in my life, well I guess I would. It seems not too hard to imagine someone keeping a person at gunpoint, and threatening you to give up your 60k TV that you just bought, so you can save this mans life. Will you do it? Of course you will. But, there are people metaphorically being kept at gunpoint by yamadeva (the dying people) and yet we don't do anything to save them. It's just a fucking TV. But how many TV's is one life worth and how many TV's is 10 lives worth. 

Based on these, there are the secondary and tertiary wants so to naively speak, such as : wanting toned abs, wanting tasty foods, wanting a cool social cirlce, wanting hip clothes, wanting the latest IPAD, Mercedes etc. This we call for now as secondary wants as they are based on primary wants.

We think some secondary or tertiary wants will get us to our primary wants. If you look at the nature of people trying to workout, I imagine one of the reasons is with the hope that it gets girls. To be properly toned takes a couple of years. There seem to be far better techniques with faster and quicker results that we could pursue instead.

The real question is what do we want to do, owing to our vascillatory nature. It is clear there is no consistancy.Where do we go from here?

Summary is that what we want seems to be circular, now what?


So we seem to want some wants more than others. Like for example, we can don't mind giving up a 60k Television when someone is held at gunpoint.

I would like to figure out what I should be doing. If I should 


#### Reason for such problems

Evolutoin and the like


#### Design rules connecting the value system to "reality"

We have a true value system, and a set of design rules, that help us compute the reality cheaply[[Citation needed][]]. The brain can be imagined as a computer with a ram and storage. Given an infinite ram (computational capability) within an infinitely large storage, it should be  possible to compute what will happen at a given moment in the future in this world, based upon physics of the universe and an initial condition. But we don't have such infinite ram to make those costly but True computations. In an attempt to bypass such complex computations, in a "conservative manner", we have some design rules.

When designing machines, we use rules of thumb. This is primarily to increase speed at which designs are done, without loosing too much cost. For example, if we have a thread, the mating surface will automatically have 0.5mm diameter higher hole than the thread diameter. As designers we don't need to every time, spend resources on deciding what type of mating-hole diameter we should use. By doing this, there is literally no increase in costs at all. We just save a lot of man hrs. Similarly, within our body, we have such rules of thumb (design rules); 'Sugar Urge' and 'Social proof' are some of them.

Sugary foods such as apples, oranges and other fruits are rich in vitamins. Instead of making calculations into the future regarding availability of fruits, the evolution just decided to keep a very high threshold on sugary products, as there was [no way of overeating it in the bygone days][sugar].<!-- The design rules were made in the stone age and haven't been updated to be relevant in the recent times[[Citation needed][]]. If we strictly listen to our urge and eat a lot donuts as a result we are sure to have [problems][sugar]. -->

Another example of design rule is social proof.

>Social proof, also known as informational social influence, is a psychological phenomenon where people assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior for a given situation. This effect is prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate mode of behavior, and is driven by the assumption that surrounding people possess more knowledge about the situation.

P.S

I've read that post atleast 5 to 10 times fully. I suspect that this is all I do, even when I start writing. I think like a bitch. I ponder. Shut up and write. just keep writing. and then edit the fuck out of it.... refucking writing.

This is about the part that I seem to sort of understand that there is nothing else to do other than use feelings!
