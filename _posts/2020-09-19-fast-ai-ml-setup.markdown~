## Prepping ubuntu

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	
Software and updates also does the above. But you see errors with
[ppa](https://itsfoss.com/ppa-guide/) with `sudo apt-get update` [it seems](https://askubuntu.com/questions/362872/is-using-software-updater-the-same-thing-as-running-apt-get-update-and-apt-get-u).

If PPA seems not necessary anymore: Fixing errors with `sudo apt-get
update` --> fixed with `#` in the `ppa` directory (source: [here](https://itsfoss.com/ppa-guide/)).

Had errors in ppa from opencpu, seems to be used for R but I don't
know if there is even a point in maintaining the ppa. For later. For
now `#`.


## changing ubuntu desktop

All the info you need about environments is [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/65083/what-kinds-of-desktop-environments-and-shells-are-available). There is unity,
there is gnome there is kde...

Unity is default till 16.

## Installing fastai

**Resources**

How to install nvidia drivers is [here](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-install-nvidia-driver-latest-proprietary-driver/) and [here](https://askubuntu.com/a/851144/443958) and [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/61396/how-do-i-install-the-nvidia-drivers).


### question (no answer on stack) (archive)

[Stack link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1276660/identify-and-install-the-latest-nvidia-driver-for-ubuntu-16)

**Goal**

I somehow installed the driver 3 years back and want to check if I
have the latest ones and if they are upgraded.

**Status**

`Additional drivers` in `Software & Updates` shows a bunch of
NVIDIA graphics drivers. And currently `390` has been installed and I
see it working with the processes using the GPU, with:
	
	nvidia-smi

I dont think I have added repos ever, (like [this][1]):

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
    sudo apt update 

I know this because I don't see the `graphics-drivers` PPA's in 

    grep ^ /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*


**Question**

0. When I look in Nvidia website there is a higher proprietary version
[450](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/163238/en-us), based on the official [Nvidia driver finder](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us). When I look in launchpad it says [`430`][2] is the current supported version, but`450`
is not shown in `additional drivers`. Why? What am I missing?

1. I want to go to the latest driver available. Is `390` the latest
   stable release for Ubuntu 16.04? How do I figure this out?
  
2. There are many ways to install `450` (I am afraid of conflicts or my
   system breaking). Which should I prefer now that I have `390` via
   `additional drivers`? 

	- download from [Nvidia site](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/135161/en-us) and install
	- apt-get has it's own install `sudo apt-get nvidia-\*\*450\*\*`,
      once I have the `graphics-drivers` PPA's.
	- add PPAs and install from `additional drivers`

3. Should I uninstall `390` so I can install `450` and if so how? (there is no option in
   `additional drivers` to unselect all options). Is the following ok?
   
		$ sudo apt purge nvidia-390 -y
		$ sudo apt autoremove -y
		$ sudo apt autoclean

4. Should I [disable][3] `secure boot` before installing and enable it afterwards?

**Current Config**

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS & Windows 10 dual boot
- 8 gb ram
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050/PCIe/SSE2

## Installing fastai with dependencies

**Packages to be installed** can be found in the [`environment.yml`](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/environment.yml)

**What seems to work (period)**:

	conda create --name fastaiclean 

	conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda fastai 
	
	conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda gh
	
	conda install -c conda-forge notebook
	
Yes to all the disclaimers such as additional packages to be installed.
	
	
Based on [this stack answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64056681/5986651): We don't need to install anaconda
package as the miniconda install doesn't seem to require it.
	
	
**What doens't work**

	`conda create --name fastai --clone base`

[Man page](https://docs.fast.ai/#Installing) instructions and directly into existing anaconda setup
leads to conflicts (not sure how to solve):

	conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda fastai gh anaconda


**Error** seems to be some [HTTPS error with Pytorch](https://forums.fast.ai/t/pytorch-installation-in-conda-environment-failing/6703). 


**What else seems to work (but didn't try)** 

**Source:** [forums of fastai](https://forums.fast.ai/t/platform-local-server-ubuntu/65851/22)

	git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai2
	cd fastai2

### GPU not working (running intro.pynb)

``` python
ImportError: IProgress not found. Please update jupyter and ipywidgets. See https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html
```

Fix from this [link](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html), 

	conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets

**FASTAI works.** Somehow the GPU was not used, and what took 1 min
for the lecturer in lesson 1 took me 15 mins (atleast that's what it
said).

### Fixing slow computer (swap)

- Swap occupied and reverting back from swap

Based on this [stack answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/756409/443958)

	sudo swapoff -a
	sudo swapon -a

## Fixing GPU not working

### Installing the right drivers

**Basically**: `Additional drivers` tab in `Softwares & Updates` does it for you.

Check which drivers are installed?

- `dpkg --get-selections | grep nvidia`

- Go to `Additional drivers` and see what is selected

**Identify the latest stable driver** for Ubuntu 16 and GTX 10 series
GeForce 1050 by:

- Highest in `Additional drivers`

- Launchpad (graphics drivers ppa basically)

- [**launchpad**](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) says `430` (430.40)

	- Also the version names contained in the table below show 16.04
      for `430`.

**Uninstall and Re-install**

Add PPA.

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa

**Don't uninstall**! Just change on `additional drivers` and
rebooted and see that `nvidia-smi` shows `430`. 

**Note**: `dpkg --get-selections | grep nvidia` now shows `nvidia-390
deinstall` and `nvidia-430 install`. This doesn't matter.

**Note**: It also says it is **open source** in my `addtional driver`
tab. This looks like a [bug](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1185924/nvidia-vs-nouveau-drivers). It is **proprietary** as fuck.

### What Nvidia driver should I install for Ubuntu 16.04

My question on [AskUbuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1277947/what-are-the-latest-stable-proprietary-drivers-for-ubuntu-16-04-and-nvidia-gefor):

Which is the **LATEST STABLE proprietary drivers** for UBUNTU **16.04** and NVIDIA
Geforce **GTX 1050** (4gb)? There are simply too many answers which I have compiled below:

1. **Nvidia site** says [450](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/163238/en-us)(450.66) is the latest for GTX 1050 (not
   ubuntu version specific)

	- download from [Nvidia site](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/135161/en-us) and install
	- apt-get has it's own install `sudo apt-get nvidia-\*\*450\*\*`,
	
2. **Additional drivers** tab in `Software and Updates` only shows version
   `390`
   
   - **Note:** `graphics-drivers` PPA's have not been added yet.
   
3. [**launchpad**](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) says `430` (430.40)
   
    > Current long-lived branch release: `nvidia-430` (430.40) Dropped
	> support for Fermi series
	> (https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4656)
	
4. [**Launchpad**](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) also says old branch for GeForce 10 series (1050) is
   390.129
   
   > Old long-lived branch release: `nvidia-390` (390.129)
   > For GF1xx GPUs use `nvidia-390` (390.129)

5. [Launchpad here](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) shows overview of packages (scroll down).

	Here the version names contain 16.04 for `430`.
	
6. [Ubuntu recommended drivers](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia#NVIDIA_drivers_provided_by_the_Ubuntu_repositories) shows different version for
   ubuntu. If I go by this then only `384` has supported versions for
   16.04 (Xenial Xerus)

## Fixing issues with Cuda

`pytorch` needs to be compiled with the right cuda. If you look on
`pytorch`'s website it is always installed with torchvision and cuda
version.

CUDA version needs to be matched by the nvidia drivers as per [table 1](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.HTML).

[pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) will use it's own cuda (looks like). External CUDA driver from
NVIDIA website not required.

### Multiple versions of cuda in the system

[Stack question by me](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64089854/pytorch-detection-of-cuda).

I have Nvidia driver `430` on Ubuntu 16.04 with Geforce 1050. It comes
with `libcuda1-430` when I installed the driver from `additional
drivers` tab in ubuntu (`Software and Updates`). I installed `pytorch`
with `conda` which also installed the `cudatoolkit`. 

1. `nvidia-smi` says I have cuda version `10.1`

2. `conda list` tells me cudatoolkit version is `10.2.89` 

3. `print(torch.cuda.current_device())`, I get `10.0.10`? (it
   looks like):
   
    > AssertionError: The NVIDIA driver on your system is too old
		(found version 10010)

4. `print(torch._C._cuda_getCompiledVersion(), 'cuda compiled
   version')` tells me my version is `10.0.20`? 
   
   > 10020 cuda compiled version
   
What am I missing? What version of CUDA is my torch actually looking
at? Why are there so many different versions?

<!-- Based on [Nvidias site](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html) I know I need to have <=`CUDA 10.1 -->
<!-- (10.1.105)`. -->

### what is your version of cuda

1. `nvidia-smi` is just showing version it can handle according to
   [Berriel from stack](https://stackoverflow.com/q/64089854/5986651)
   
2. Using `torch.version.cuda` we can find out which version pytorch
   was built with. this was found to be 10.2 (as was `cudatoolkit
   version`)
   
3. & 4. forget it.

Suggestion was to remove pytorch torchvision and cudatoolkit

	conda remove pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit

### Does your cuda work?

[Source 1](https://chrisalbon.com/deep_learning/pytorch/basics/check_if_pytorch_is_using_gpu/), [Stack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48152674/how-to-check-if-pytorch-is-using-the-gpu) 

**If testing goes well**

``` python
In [1]: import torch

In [2]: torch.cuda.current_device()
Out[2]: 0

In [3]: torch.cuda.device(0)
Out[3]: <torch.cuda.device at 0x7efce0b03be0>

In [4]: torch.cuda.device_count()
Out[4]: 1

In [5]: torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)
Out[5]: 'GeForce GTX 950M'

In [6]: torch.cuda.is_available()
Out[6]: True
```
**If wrong version of cuda**


	print(torch.cuda.device_count())
	0
	print(torch.cuda.current_device())
	
	AssertionError: 
	The NVIDIA driver on your system is too old (found version 10010).
	
Looking the assertion error on google points to [github pytorch
issues](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/4546) where they talk about versions not matching of the driver
and the CUDA version. Digging a bit deeper you see the NVIDIA website
regarding cuda and driver version numbers [Table 1: Nvidia site](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html).

### Downgrading cudatoolkit without conflicts

Current version of cuda:

	torch.version.cuda
	
	10.2

Version corresponding to NVIDIA driver (in this case 430)

- nvidia-smi says 10.1
- [Table 1: Nvidia site](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html) also says 10.1 and below (roughly).

**What doesn't work?**

In the current conda installing with `cudatoolkit` `pytorch` and
`torchvision` gives tons of [errors](https://pastebin.com/WPJRDwBw).

``` terminal
conda install pytorch==1.6.0 torchvision==0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1.168
-c pytorch
```

**What works**

Pytorch installation seems to be paired with pytorch torchvision and
cudatoolkit according to [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/).

Remove pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit:

	conda remove pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit

	conda install pytorch==1.6.0 torchvision==0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1.168 -c pytorch


Again it asks for several things I say yes blindly but 	seemingly **NO
CONFLICTS**

check what torch.version.cuda is: `10.1`. GREAT we have successfully downgraded.

**Checking seems successful** based on [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48152675/5986651)

``` python
In [1]: import torch

In [2]: torch.cuda.current_device()
Out[2]: 0

In [3]: torch.cuda.device(0) ## previously this gave "old driver error"
Out[3]: <torch.cuda.device at 0x7efce0b03be0>

In [4]: torch.cuda.device_count()
Out[4]: 1

In [5]: torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)
Out[5]: 'GeForce GTX 950M'

In [6]: torch.cuda.is_available()
Out[6]: True
```
`torch.cuda.device(0)` previously gave the assertion error that Nvidia
driver was too old. Now I have the value as 0 which seems to be
expected as per: [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48152675/5986651). 

**Fresh error:** Now fastai is missing probably got removed when I
removed pytorch or re-installed pytorch.

    conda install -c pytorch -c fastai fastai
	
So far so good. Testing again:

``` terminal
eghx@eghx-nitro:~$ conda activate fastaiclean
(fastaiclean) eghx@eghx-nitro:~$ python

**Other tools**

		conda search -c pytorch cudatoolkit ## searching for available version
		
		conda list pytorch ## current version installed




## Making GPU work faster

So 2 things I can do. Install libraries that do faster work and then
remove all other processes on the gpu except cuda.

**Removing xorg processes**

1. change intel graphics card on `nvidia settings`

	or `prime-select intel`

2. added the 

		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia-430:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
		
and then restarted....

- Put command in '2' in .bashrc to work with every terminal
open... `LD_Library_path` loses its value after terminal session


**Result**

- visibly no difference in speed
- you only save 11% of the gpu. 
- second screen doesn't work
- need to spend even more and more time to fix it.

| Reverting back                  | 2.10  | 1.18  |

| second time                     | 0.58  |1.17  |

We can pursue this later if required.

**Going back to xorg and all the same way**

[Nvidia forums](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/nvidia-settings-error-unable-to-load-info-from-any-available-system/60804/5): `prime-select nvidia`

works.

**Next: So** let's add the xconf file back and see what it does. or
modify it ..

If this allows monitor to work, we keep it otherwise we go back with
`prime-select nvidia`

I want to check out the xconf solution without even modifying any
xconf process.

[components of a GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_server)

It's too complicated to get other screen to work and get cuda to
run.. Especially for the complete lack of progress I got. so screw
that.

`sudo prime-select nvidia`

**Making GPU work faster with libraries**

Don't know what this does. Blindly followed it

	conda uninstall --force jpeg libtiff -y

### Unable to reproduce the "faster libraries" in another env

Unable to reproduce this in other python environment for
some reason. Don't know why...

Based on [stack](conda list -n python3 --export > python3-packages.txt

0 differences found, even with manual conda list. don't know where I
screwed up the installation... or what to do to rectify it.

### PIL error

``` python
ImportError: The _imaging extension was built for another version of Pillow or PIL:

Apparently, "This is only an installation issue."---[stack](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27804221/5986651).

**Uninstalling pillow and pillow-simd**

	conda uninstall pillow

Said yes to everything

	conda uninstall pillow-simd

Doesn't work. It says no:

Open jupyter notebook and do the [following](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60492355/5986651):

	!pip uninstall -y pillow-simd
	
check with 

	conda list pil
	
now reinstall it...

	CC="cc -mavx2" pip install --no-cache-dir -U --force-reinstall --no-binary :all: --compile pillow-simd

Was I supposed to install pillow first?

now somehow fastai is missing. :(

	conda install -c pytorch -c fastai fastai
	
yes to all

OK that nonsense works. 

**BTW pillow is currently not installed...**

Checked timings with the standard file and all seems well.

## power off when sleep when GPU is full (recovery)

**What seems to work with existing config**: 

- sleep/wakeup and shutdown normally

- If I shut down the gpu by closing the jupyter kernel then all is
  good.

- whether I shutdown the gpu or not I can still shutdown.

**What doesn't work with existing config**: 

- when Jupyter finishes running and the gpu is full sleep doesn't work

- It hangs (`C-M-F7/F1`) doesn't work. It's hung I think.

### What all I attempted before screwing up the system.

I am tempted to try the following:

1. [18.04 Screen remains blank after wake up from suspend](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1032633/18-04-screen-remains-blank-after-wake-up-from-suspend)

	- look into kernels
	- remove gdm and go to lightdm? (but I seem to already have lightdm)
	- hybrid settings in bios
	- install unity-ubuntu-desktop
	- nouveau.modeset=0 (but i am not even using nouveau)

2. [System freeze after suspend](https://askubuntu.com/questions/882843/system-freeze-after-suspend)

	- switch to lightdm
	- do I have hybrid graphics?
	
3. [suspend, hibernate issues issues with nvidia](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/solved-suspend-resuming-and-wakeup-with-nvidia370-28/45282/10)

	- 5 steps to do. Maybe try this as it is from nvidia. Doens't work
      for 18 but might work for 16 I guess.
	  
4. trying to perhaps see the error

	- remove quiet splash to see [where the error is](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2329042)
	
5. other blind guesses

	- [reinstall the driver](https://askubuntu.com/q/970880/443958) (Not sure but it is in comments)
		- downgrade perhaps (really not sure if this is the direction)
		- suggestion of using 390 and 16 seems to work for [this
          guy](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/problem-with-resume-from-suspend-ubuntu-16-04-gt-940mx/51410/69) (with instructions)
	- adding no modeset in grub screen?
	- changing kernel?
	- resetting [monitors before sleeping](https://askubuntu.com/a/804831/443958)? `xrandr -s 0`

This is ubuntu 16 pertinent.

5. [Almost same issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54393074/black-screen-after-waking-from-suspend-ubuntu-budgie-18-10)

	- change powermizer to adaptive is one solution (change it back later)
	- other unaccepted solution of the same question in [ask
      ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/a/1114748/443958) is to change grub to something else...
	  
			GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet acpi_rev_override=1 acpi_osi=Linux scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=1 nouveau.modeset=0 nouveau.runpm=0 mem_sleep_default=deep"


6. [Updating kernel](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/problem-with-resume-from-suspend-ubuntu-16-04-gt-940mx/51410/61) to 4.17?

	- update kernel to next version?
	- kernel apparently didn't do it all for [this guy](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/problem-with-resume-from-suspend-ubuntu-16-04-gt-940mx/51410/69) with ubuntu
      16 and 4.15 kernel
	-[ Another user](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/problem-with-resume-from-suspend-ubuntu-16-04-gt-940mx/51410/77) reporting this is not working for them :(
      kernel 4.17
	

**What all I did:**

1. Based on [Nvidia forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/solved-suspend-resuming-and-wakeup-with-nvidia370-28/45282) added the following to grub and updated grub (sudo grub-update)

		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet acpi_rev_override=1
		acpi_osi=Linux scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=1 nouveau.modeset=0
		nouveau.runpm=0 mem_sleep_default=deep"
		
		sudo update-grub
		
		sudo gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
		
		nvidia
		nvidia_modeset
		nvidia_uvm
		nvidia_drm
		
		sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
		
	Got some warning for this but apprently it doesn't mean anything as
    I have an i5 system ---[Stack](https://askubuntu.com/a/832528/443958)

2.  Didn't change kernel as there was no evidence towards it. People
    changed to 4.17. Ming is currently 4.15

	- [4.17 but it didn't work](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/problem-with-resume-from-suspend-ubuntu-16-04-gt-940mx/51410/63)

	- [this guy](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/problem-with-resume-from-suspend-ubuntu-16-04-gt-940mx/51410/69)

3. Tried different suspends ([Suspend](https://askubuntu.com/a/1795/443958))

4. Tried downgrading.
	
		sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
		sudo apt update 
		
	Selected 384 version.
	
	It didn't allow me to work with pytorch 1.6 so I wanted to go
    back.
	
5. Tried upgrading back to 430

		sudo apt-get purge nvidia*

	Additional drivers tab was all greyed out.
	
		sudo apt remove nvidia-*  
		sudo apt autoremove  
		
		sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
		
	Rebooted to black screen of death (tried [this](https://askubuntu.com/a/1096038/443958)) but all seemed
    ok. Added `nomodeset` to grub (In hindsight I could have done:
    `nouveau.modeset=0` I think).
	
	As a last step went to `prime select intel` and it finally allowed
    me to boot with just intel graphics card. Despite having 430
    installed nothing works with it...
	
	Again blank screen and then `noveau.modeset=0` did the trick
	
6. did complete re-install of xserver, unity, lightdm and the nvidia drivers
	
So far I have one screen working and the gpu not being NVIDIA.

that's when I gave up... Now god forbid I had to recover.

### Recovering linux system from said fatality

**"re-installing" xorg, lightdm, unity and then nvidia**


**Graphical interface/~~Display manager~~/Desktop environments**:  Unity, Gnome

Protocol between GI and DS: X11, wayland etc...

**Display Server**: Xorg | window manager: Compiz (resize or postion
window, close minimize etc...)

**Display manager**: Lightdm or gdm etc... (starting your login screen)

This has to be my best recovery so far. It took so much time to prep
know the details. But I can say I did it STM. I think I can. Usually I
was so afraid of screwing up the system (rightly so), but now I read
and read and read, see what other's advice is, know "roughly what the
commands mean". And then plan out the commands and jump into it.

Based mainly on [How to install Nvidia drivers](https://askubuntu.com/questions/61396/how-do-i-install-the-nvidia-drivers), [Graphics issues
in 16.04](https://askubuntu.com/a/760935/443958) and [re-installing xorg and xserver](https://www.computersnyou.com/4945/re-install-xorg-xserver-completely-ubuntu/), [What is gdm3,
kdm, lightdm? How to install and remove them?](https://askubuntu.com/a/829110/443958).

Went to TTY screen which I invoked before logging in:

**X-server and Xorg and Lightdm**

	sudo apt-get purge xorg-* "xserver-*"
	sudo apt-get purge lightdm
	
Removing dependencies and recommended packages of the purged packages
(if installed with them),

	sudo apt-get auroremove 
	
	sudo apt-get install xorg xserver-xorg
	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg
	
Configuring lightdm means selecting lightdm instead of gdm

	sudo apt-get lightdm
	sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
	
Now unity. So in my system ubuntu-desktop was not installed, instead
only unity was installed but everywhere I found ubuntu-desktop being
included so just added it. A quick search showed that ubuntu-desktop
has it's own unity.

	sudo apt-get purge ubuntu-desktop
	sudo apt-get purge unity
	
	sudo apt-get autoremove
	
	sudo apt-get install unity ubuntu-desktop
	
Re-installing nvidia

	sudo apt-get purge nvidia-*
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
	
	sudo apt-get update
	
To see the recognized drivers and what is the recommended driver etc...

	ubuntu-drivers devices

Installs the recommended drivers also can be done manually with `sudo
apt-get install nvidia-430`.

	sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall

We can go and check in the `additional drivers tab` later.

The last step I did and probably the most important was to make an
`xorg.conf` file. This I somehow had in the previous installation and
`nvidia-xconfig` didn't bring it back. So I literally copied a back up
and pasted it.

``` conf
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier "layout"
    Screen 0 "nvidia"
    Inactive "intel"
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier "intel"
    Driver "modesetting"
    BusID "PCI:0@0:2:0"
    Option "AccelMethod" "None"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "intel"
    Device "intel"
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier "nvidia"
    Driver "nvidia"
    BusID "PCI:1@0:0:0"
    Option "ConstrainCursor" "off"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "nvidia"
    Device "nvidia"
    Option "AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration" "on"
    Option "IgnoreDisplayDevices" "CRT"
EndSection
```

That was it. I didn't put anything in grub I think.

**Check with**

`nvidia-smi`

&

`nvidia-settings`

& `aditional drivers tab`

**Result**

System works like in the past. the issue with not being able to sleep
when GPU is full is still pending.

There are [many people](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/problem-with-resume-from-suspend-ubuntu-16-04-gt-940mx/51410/2)who were not able to solve this on their
system. For some users it was concluded that it was a BIOS issue with
their ASUS systems. Read this entire thread [here](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/problem-with-resume-from-suspend-ubuntu-16-04-gt-940mx/51410/2). So if you can't
get it to work. It's ok. It's alright. We're the same and there is no
need to cry.

## fastai functions not working


NameError: name 'widgets' is not defined


Is it supposed to be in fastbook?

Why do we need fastbook? What's happening?

**Where are these functions?**

**Is it in fastbook**

Seems like it... tried it out on Gradient and I am certain it is this
lack of `fastbook` and `graphviz`

**Re-installing until fastai fresh env**

	conda install -c fastai -c pytorch fastai cudatoolkit=10.1.243 gh
	
	conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets
	
	didn't help

**Unable to install fastbook via conda install**

Also python version seesm to have downgraded to python 3.7 (in
fastaicleantest alone)

It seems like a known issue that `conda instal` doesn't work whereas
pip works WTF.

1: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9868

2: https://github.com/KevinMusgrave/pytorch-metric-learning/issues/55

pip install seems to be the way to go...

Testing...

clean test seems to be distroyed. Won't install graphviz


## Fastai cuda not working AGAIN :(



## Quick reinstall

	conda install -c fastai -c pytorch fastai cudatoolkit=10.1.243 gh
	

ends up downgrading 3 packages including pythiath
	
	conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets
	
ends up installing new packages

	pip install -Uqq fastbook

0 output

	conda install graphviz


Not tested the last part with `graphviz`. While installing
fastaiclean4 I installed graphviz after `gh`. And then had problems
with fasiai recognizing that I had installed graphviz. Removed and
reinstalled and all seemed to be goo.


fastaiclean is ok with libtiff steffs

	Sometimes I get the fastbook.setup_book() error related to
	graphviz... I don't why I get it sometimes and not someother
	times. Jesus

fastaiclean test is ruined (can't recover)

fastaiclean4 is a fresh install without the libtiff steffs. 



graphviz still causing issues... I don't know why? it is not
displaying hte pictures via gv...


## GPU full

``` python
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 22.00 MiB (GPU 0;
3.95 GiB total capacity; 3.01 GiB already allocated; 19.50 MiB free;
3.10 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch)
```
Tried changing batch size (bs) as suggested by Jeremy but reducing it
to 32 and 16 didn't yield any results. 

A possibility could be to try and free up the space in the GPU used by
compiz and Xorg. But it sounds like a bad idea, as it will take tons
of time. I have already spent 1-2 full days on it without any
results. My dual screen wont work and I don't know how to get it to
work. 

While using the system and the GPU it is impossible to do any work
despite the ram being completely free. 

Considering all this, it seems wise to move to paper space. It seems
faster maybe I might have to end up paying money. But that is a choice
i think I can figure out later if necessary.

Sometimes cuda memory becomes full while running the cells fresh... It
also takes a long time. Unsure how to reduce it at the cost of
accuracy.

So I think for now as paperspace is faster and freer and I don't use
emacs anyways... So I don't see the value of trying to get it to work
in my pc. Let's move to paperspace. the error I see that made me do
this is:

## Question

**Suspend not working after GPU is full**

On normal occasions when `xorg` and `compiz` is running in my gpu, I
can `Suspend` peacefully. However if I run some **intense** (90% GPU
in use) training (via jupyter) related to `pytorch`, and subsequently
suspend after the processes are over, it refuses to sleep/wakeup.

I am positive GPU being full or not empty is causing the issue. I
don't know why "some process" possibly related to the GPU is not
Suspending. When I run `jupyter` and run `1+1` (or a simple process)
and `Suspend`, then also no issues.

**Question**

Kernlog shows me nothing "fishy". I have tried a bunch of online
remedies. Now at a dead end. 

How do I identify what is happening? any ideas?

**Other symptoms**

It sort-of sleeps but I still hear some sound from the laptop when I
hit a key (it sounds as if it is booting up). And then blank screen
after that. Sometimes I get to go to the TTY but can't type anything.

**What all I tried to rectify this issue?**

Spent a good 5 full days understanding and searching and re-installing
etc... Now at a dead end.

0. Checked the [kern logs (pastebin link)](https://pastebin.com/B1TNtKPt) but didn't see anything
   "fishy". (at `02:08` I start sleeping and at `10:21` I hit hard

1. Based on [Nvidia forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/solved-suspend-resuming-and-wakeup-with-nvidia370-28/45282) added the following to grub and updated.

		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet acpi_rev_override=1
		acpi_osi=Linux scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=1 nouveau.modeset=0
		nouveau.runpm=0 mem_sleep_default=deep"
		
	Added the following to iniramfs-tools/modules and updated.
	
		nvidia
		nvidia_modeset
		nvidia_uvm
		nvidia_drm

2. Didn't change kernel as there was no evidence towards it. People
   changed to 4.17. Mine is currently 4.15.

3. Blind try: Trying different ([Suspend](https://askubuntu.com/a/1795/443958))s
   
		systemctl suspend
	   
		pm-suspend
		
4. Tried downgrading the drivers to 384 from 430 with changing it at
   `additional drivers`. This was not useful as this was not capable
   of co-existing with `pytorch=1.6.0` 
   
   
5. Complete remove and re-install of `nvdia-430` as per [here](https://askubuntu.com/a/760935/443958):   
   `purge`, `add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa`, `update`
   and `autoinstall`.
   
   This ended in the black screen of death. Recovered it with
   `noveau.modeset=0`. Somehow GPU was not working anymore. 
   
6. At this point did a [complete re-install](https://askubuntu.com/a/760935/443958) of `xserver`,`unity`,
   `lightdm` and `nvidia-430` over tty terminal before login screen.
   
   This recovered the system to it's previous state i.e., `suspend`
   when GPU full hangs the system.

**My system**

- Ubuntu 16.04
- Nvidia 1050 GeForce
