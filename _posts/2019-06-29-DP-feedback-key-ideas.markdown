**[Actual essay](/DP-claims-9.html)**: DP claims #9

## Feedback from last essay

Mr. Agent,

Good job on continuously doing the exercise for 5+ hours every day.

> There are (many issues)[1] we haven't been able to look into yet, so
> we expect there are other (high-impact areas we haven't listed)[3].

What made them expect that there are other areas left? If I don't like
plain Parle G biscuits even after trying many times, I won't say that
"I expect there are other tasty, plain Parle G biscuits that we
haven't listed".

Perhaps they've seen an average of 3 out of 10 areas to be promising,
so based on that they expect that maybe 3 out of the remaining 10
would also be good. Or maybe not 3, but at least 1 or 2.

If they had tried a hundred areas and found zero promising ones, they
would not expect too many promising areas in the future.

**************************Reply***********************************

Great! Didn't think of it like this! I tried to look for evidence
related to the hypothetical example you gave, but didn't find info on
how many issues they looked into. Could I have done better?

****************************End************************************

Your response:

> example.
>
> For [8], we think of a personal fit of more than 50%
>
> For [7], we think of an impact of 5300*50%=2650 lives which is

But that doesn't use [8] at all. Why is it **particularly** worth
pursuing if you are "especially motivated"? The "impact" [7] you
pointed out would seem to be the same if you had [8] or if you didn't.

I would expect an example where someone who had this magical [8] went
on to have particularly great "impact". And I suspect that they do not
have that example.

Consider this: You can bowl a particularly high bouncer if you're 6
feet tall. Showing Bhuvaneshwar Kumar bowling a bouncer is not an
example. You have to show Courtney Walsh bowling a bouncer that is one
foot higher than usual bouncers.

**************************Reply***********************************

OK! So it seems that I have missed the comparison of [8] vs not
[8]. i.e., what happens when AI safety is not motivating or less
motivating.

****************************End************************************

The word "most" should trigger your spider sense. If you recall our
past discussions, you can say "most" only when you've actually
compared against everybody else in the set and found it to have the
highest value.

This sentence uses "most" thrice. They may be right about what they're
saying, but can you verify it? For [3], have you compared global
problems to see which one is most "pressing" (A)? For [2], have you
compared the bottlenecks to progress in that field and found the one
that is most "pressing" (B)? Finally, for [1], have you compared the
"effectiveness" of different careers, however they define it, and
found the most effective one (C)?

For the claim to be true, when you look at career C, you must
independently see that what it is addressing is B and the global
problem it is working on is A. Otherwise, that claim is false.

**************************Reply***********************************

When we have "most", the work needed to give one example for that
claim becomes n-times (where n is the number of items in the set). For
example, if we talk about "most careers" we need to evaluate the
"effectiveness" of all of these n careers.

For [1], I can't compare all careers practically, so what should I do?
how big should the set practically be? what do you expect? Is it good
enough to show say 5 careers that are "top" according to 80k and go
from there?

For [2], I can look at say 3 of the bottlenecks to progress of [3].

For [3], I can probably compare the top 5 80khours set of careers that
they think is pressing

Is that ok? or?

SST has been re-activated.

One way is to look at the rejection rate, if available, for
professorship or post-doctoral fellowship for those who went to the
industry after PhD. This data may not be publicly available, but
professors who are on the hiring committee would know and would be
able to tell people like 80k. They could tell you if they expected
higher results from those who left academia.

**************************Reply***********************************
So when I come across such claims, what do you expect from me? I think
I searched for atleast an hour regarding this. Should I skip these? or
should I make a comment like you have done above ("rejection rate ...")?

They aren't claiming that it is "good". They are claiming that it is
"especially high-impact". They should have a rough cutoff for how many
lives or dollars or whatever constitute "low-impact", "high-impact",
or "especially high-impact". Then, you won't need to contrast against
anything else.

**************************Reply***********************************

1. I have covered the "especially high impact" in the next claim
"[3] is high-impact". I see your point, the first 2 sentences could
have been combined to 1, and I would have only one claim to answer. I
usually look at sentences in isolation when I write claims, unless
they are connected by words like "these roles". I will try and be
aware of this thing.

2. But 80khours believes in WORDS like "high-impact", what do you expect
from me when I send you these things for feedback? Is the example I
have good enough for now? or?

Empirically false. Plenty of people doubted it before AI safety went
[mainstream](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/495759307346952192?lang=en) in late 2014. Many still doubt it.

**************************Reply***********************************

This seems to be another "most effective careers" moment, where the
word "most"---and in this case "NO"---is critical. Either I provide,
every example of people not doubting [1]. Or I provide 1 example for
doubting and I am done. Correct me if I am wrong!

In other words, we have no concrete example. If they said that
diseases put human civilization at stake, we can point to the Black
Plague, which killed nearly half the people of Western Europe. Or
nukes (Japan). Or asteroids (dinosaurs).

**************************Reply***********************************

Because they are predicting something of the future, you are saying
there is no example! 

But we can imagine one concrete way atleast (Russia using an
autonomous weapon system resulting in war) where [3] is at stake due
to AI. Isn't that the point though, that we do "concrete thinking"
aka, remove the words and think of examples (hypothetical as they may
be)? Why do you seem to be against hypothetical examples?

"most".

**************************Reply***********************************

But how will the example look then?

**Example**: So I would need to compare the industrial revolution to
the only other "popular" revolution---agricultural revolution---and
compare it to show which one was "profound". Correct? 

If there are 10 other revolutions, do you expect me within the scope
of this document to compare all 10 and identify which one was the
"most profound"?

It's not. There are [polls](https://intelligence.org/files/PredictingAI.pdf "page 15") of AI experts asking when they think
"AI" will happen.

**************************Reply***********************************
1. My mistake is that I only gave the example for ONE EXPERT? where as I
need to give an example (aka polls) where MORE EXPERTS are involved?

2. And also my interpretation of "third revolution" as the
doom of mankind, was also wrong. Correct?
****************************End************************************

**We don't have concrete examples for "could happen"**, because it would
then be "did happen". Should ask them why they are so confident if
they haven't seen any concrete examples.

> I have no idea how to answer this claim, how do I give an example
> that will inform if A then B.

Again, it's great if there is a concrete example, such as "if you boil
water on the stove, it will evaporate" - I saw it myself. But if not,
you have to **mark the claim as "no concrete example"**.

Another sentence: "Given that we want batsmen who are short and have
curly hair, here are the batsmen we found: Sachin Tendulkar, ..."

So, if you sorted the table of "all careers" using the fields "how
pressing is this problem?" and "how pressing is the bottleneck they're
focusing on?", then the five top careers are ...

Giving an example of Jacques Kallis would be wrong because he isn't
short and doesn't have curly hair. Ricky Ponting would be wrong
because he doesn't have curly hair.

"Generating ideas for new career paths". Maybe AI is tough for someone
because he has no CS skills, but he could switch from political
science to a PhD in economics. The list gives concrete examples of
careers they could consider. Imagine if they didn't. You might never
even "generate the idea" of a PhD in economics. Or you might go for
something like becoming a dentist.

**This is already a concrete example, not a claim**. A claim would be
something like "Mozart isn't a lot more precocious than modern child
pianists", for which you would give the above example.

Mission #9: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
concretely analyze the key claims in the book Superintelligence by
Nick Bostrom (the book mentioned in the Elon Musk tweet above). He's a
PhD at Oxford who's been writing about AI safety along with guys like
Eliezer for nearly two decades. The book has detailed arguments and
examples about all the topics like possible paths to
"superintelligence" (whatever that means), types of
"superintelligence", the control problem, etc.

No need to write "Question: " - doesn't seem to have changed your
answers.

Don't have to go sentence by sentence; look at one key claim for each
section, usually the one in the first few paragraphs, or one for each
paragraph if you feel it's an important section. For example:

> CHAPTER 2 Paths to superintelligence
>
> Machines are currently far inferior to humans in general
> intelligence. Yet one day (we have suggested) they will be
> superintelligent. How do we get from here to there? This chapter
> explores several conceivable technological paths. We look at
> artificial intelligence, whole brain emulation, biological
> cognition, and human-machine interfaces, as well as networks and
> organizations. We evaluate their different degrees of plausibility
> as pathways to superintelligence. The existence of multiple paths
> increases the probability that the destination can be reached via at
> least one of them.

The key claim is "How do we get from here to there? Answer: Artificial
intelligence, whole brain emulation, ..."

Feedback checklist:

1. Could it be that this claim has no/any example at all? For example,
   "civilization is at stake" or "5, could lead to extremely positive
   developments"

2. Could this claim be false? Remember the "there is no doubting"
   example.

3. Does this claim say anything about "best" (need to compare against
   the entire set) or "most" (need to show it's the majority in the
   set) or "no" (need to show that nothing in the set matches)?

4. Did you stick to examples that are in the chapter itself? That way
   you don't have to search online for too long.

5. Did you use a running example for a technical phrase? There will be
   lots of new phrases in the book, like "convergent instrumental
   value" and "orthogonality thesis". Whenever you see them, you
   should recall whatever running example you've used.

6. If this is an "if-then" claim, did you either get a concrete
   example or mark it as having no example?
   
   **************************addition***********************************
   or is there an If ("if you are especially motivated by one of them"
   example) or Given (Given Short black hair, Jacques kallis will not
   fit there in that claim) in the statement? Have you used them
   appropriately in the example?
   ****************************End************************************ 


Short names: none; false; best; chapter; running; if-then.

Please refer to the checklist after every claim analysis to ensure
you're not making old mistakes. If you want to add to the checklist
based on mistakes found in past feedback, that's great.
