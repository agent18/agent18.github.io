**Bypassing my problems**

Apply for PR and apply for passport simultaneously. I am confident I
will get a PR. It will take me atleast 3 years from now to receive it
in hand.

People have gotten their Citizenship rejected and Pr not as in the
same post above, for not meeting the requirements. However, appeals
can be made. I need to write soem FB posts and check with others
regarding what works and not.

**Q&A in the website**

[Indians in Netherlands Citizenship](http://indiansinnetherlands.com/my-experiences/dutch-citizenship/) is gold. 

Masoud: What do they check when applying for citizenship? RP
records/gemente records?

Suri: Only if you de-register it is a problem, otherwise, it is not!

Mostly my case but it is risky considering I was not in the country.
