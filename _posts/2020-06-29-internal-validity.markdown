Confounding variables check

Based on procedures of a study.

Alternative explanations ruling out.


**Cause and effect**

> As a brief summary, you can only assume cause-and-effect when you
> meet the following three criteria in your study:

> - The cause preceded the effect in terms of time.  
> - The cause and effect vary together.  
> - There are no other likely explanations for this relationship that
> you have observed.  

**Factors that improve internal validity**

- Randomization

- Random selection

- Blinding participants

- Experimental manipulation (cessation to smokers)

- Same study protocol to both groups

**Causation Correlation**

> Recall that two variables being statistically related does not
> necessarily mean that one causes the other. “Correlation does not
> imply causation.” For example, if it were the case that people who
> exercise regularly are happier than people who do not exercise
> regularly, this implication would not necessarily mean that
> exercising increases people’s happiness. It could mean instead that
> greater happiness causes people to exercise (the directionality
> problem) or that something like better physical health causes people
> to exercise and be happier (the third-variable problem).

**Checking assumptions**

If they use t-distributions then they come with assumptions.

check if the assumptions are valid.

If there are two samples then each sample has different assumptions



**Format**

Confounding variables?

Random

Randomization

Systematic issues (biases such as )

pertains to lebanon and female population

Skips "uneducated?" 

Sample issues (potential other variables)
