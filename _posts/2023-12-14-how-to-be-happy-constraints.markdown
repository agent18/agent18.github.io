## The power of "Purpose"


In the [last essay on how to be happy](/new-year-new-me-2.html), we talked about how I am
lacking a purpose. If only I had a purpose I would be much better off
I thought. We also quoted Zed from Swat Kats.

> Purpose is important, Purpose is all --- Zed (Swat Kats)

In the past, I had EA giving me that purpose. And that pretty much
guided me to figure out what I needed to do. It was soooo clear to
me. I remember once when I was speaking to a friend and she asked me
how do I know what I am doing is right. I just knew. I had
purpose. She didn't, that fool, and as a consequence that fool
couldn't make choices as easily as me.

Purpose gave me solutions to pretty much most questions I had. Spend lots
of money and travel? Nope. Grind infinitely? Yes. Become great?
Yes. Should I feel eternally guilty and keep giving as much as I can
like Shindler? Fuck Yes. Should I cook my food and spend more money?
Yesish if I end up grinding more. Should I live with roommates and save
rent? Yesish (with the idea that it helps me grind more). Should I go
to the US? Yes and make more money to give away. Making decisions was
easy with "purpose". EA was important, EA was all. EA was purpose.

If I [taboo](https://pradeep90.github.io/Rationalists-Taboo.html) the word purpose-if I am not allowed to use the word
"purpose" no more-, then what EA did for me is give constraints that
bounded, an unbounded solution space. It helped me answer questions
like "Should I work towards becoming great?" with a resounding YES. No
ambiguity.

My parents keep telling me, "marry and have kids you will have purpose
in life". Lol aside, half-assedly I actually agree with them. I think
what they prolly mean is that it will help me find solutions to
questions. Go to the US? Yes, better life for kids. Earn shit loads of
money despite feeling like shit in the US? Yes, good for your kids
future. Which location to buy a house? In the neighborhood of the best
school. See? Much less ambiguity thanks to ~~purpose~~
constraints.

However, there is still ambiguity. The constraint developed by
marrying and having kids, doesn't tell you which is the best school
for your child. Despite knowing that he (my brother) needed to buy the
house in the neighborhood of the best school, he was struggling with
understanding which the best school was. Nothing a game of
Rationalist's [Taboo](https://pradeep90.github.io/Rationalists-Taboo.html) cannot cure.

## ~~Purpose~~ Constraints FTW

Both, having a "purpose" and having constraints seem to do the exact
same thing. They both constrain the solution set to help me/us get a
non-ambiguous answer to what I/we need to do.

The only difference being, "Purpose" is this all-fancy word that
almost feels like everyone should have it. Even Martin Seligman talks
about having a purpose (not constraints) and that working with purpose
leads to lasting happiness. Whereas, "constraint" just strips away all
that fucking magic.

"Purpose" is an awesome word something everyone should strive to
have. Where as "Constraint" is a dull-ass word that no one really
cares about. I swear there was a halo shining everytime someone said
"purpose". But both of them have the exact same outcome (to
constrian). Both of them have the exact same effect.

## But the problem still remains

But without ~~purpose~~ constraints, I am fucking lost. Same questions
as before, but no answer this time. Should I go to US to do a Masters
now? Well umm (read it like Kamal Hasan). You can do all
the pros and cons list you want, but you are still the fool without
any ~~purpose~~ constraints, and as a consequence you can't make
choices as easily as you did before (without regrets). :(

## Questions I want to answer next

1. What does the "solution inside the head" constrain. 
2. How to uncover more of the solution?
3. Is designing flow level work a dead end?
4. Can we add constraints now? and how do we add it seemingly
   non-arbitrarily?

## Ideas that came while writing: 

"Purpose" is the same as "constraints", "Purpose" has halo around it.

When I read an [stm's article](https://pradeep90.github.io/what-creates-meaning.html) a few days back, I was like "ok,
what next". Also an STM pointed out in his feedback that "purpose" was
the key word and that I should taboo it. I didn't think too much of it
even then.

I didn't really expect such a "revelation" as I had today. As I was
writing a draft for todays essay it suddenly hit me, the essence of
his essay, the essence of my essay too. Not-surprisingly an STM had
written the exact same revelation in his blog too: "Lack of “Meaning”
is due to Lack of Constraints". Somehow I missed it back then. Somehow
I didn't understand it back then. "Writing makes you understand" nu
chumma va sonnanga.

I finally get it now why he was so excited about the first
essay. Fuck!
