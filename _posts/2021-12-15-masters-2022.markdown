## MIDS Berkeley

Seems like they made this completely online, with a 3 sessions on in
person stuff.

> Currently offered three times a year, each three- to four-day
> immersion is crafted to deliver additional learning, networking, and
> community-building opportunities to students.

It takes anywhere between 12 to 20 months to get done.

https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/curriculum/

> The MIDS program consists of 27 units and can be completed on one of
> three paths: accelerated, standard, or decelerated. Students who
> wish to take the program on an accelerated or decelerated basis must
> receive approval from UC Berkeley.

> The accelerated path gives students the opportunity to take three
> courses per semester to complete the program in as few as 12 months.
>
> The standard path is designed for working professionals and can be
> completed in 20 months, with two courses per semester.

**Tuition**

https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/admissions/tuition-financial-aid/

2712$ per unit X 27 enrolled units + 800$ per year = 78k$ Fuck me!


**Questions balance**

1. Is it stem?
2. Can I study in the US?
3. what about internship?
4. Doing the course in person?
5. how many inperson sessions can I attend?

Science job?

**Claim**: how to choose universities?

Brother gave a few unis, check them out, log them all



   * [ ] What are the dimensions you care about?

   * [ ] Find people ready to talk and help you with this?
   
   * [ ] Which universties to look at today
   
   * [ ] Ask karan pappala who went where? Try to call him?



## Thoughts

But what do I do?

How do I get a small

Any university is fine? 

A university is fine when it can produce Faang products and good
placements. So look in Linkedin for that info.

Alternatively it might be possible in certain unis to get merit based
scholarship and also

What masters should I choose? a CS, or a Data Science or a BI or a
Data Analyst. 

Bro said he'll fund 50-60k 0 interest loan with the understanding that
it will be very difficult for me to pay back in case I have to go back
to Netherlands if things fail.

## Rant

How to select universities?

I ideally would like to get to Faang. University to FAANG
Potential. With GSI potential.

Pricy uni with "high" GSI potential is ok. --> jobs from previous batch

Cheap uni with no GSI potential is ok. --> jobs from previous batch

Right now I can't get far with `jobs from previous batch`, I need more
info. So I should look at both Pricy (top30 unis) and eval their GSI
potential.

Then there also comes the question about doing a 1 years program or a
2 years program. I think I am ready to do 2 years if I start fall or
1.5 year if I start summer (I will have more experience). This is for
sure arbitrary. Atleast people value years, body keeps saying any
education is not better than 2-3 years exp. He values these tings
More?

I want to ask people what unis they considered. I want to stick to a
data science masters and take up a data science job. 

Look at videos, 

Get a pool of unis to look into

google unis cheap data science
google one year masters data science
google masters data science ranking
google 

Just get info of some 30 unis, then we shall go into GSI potential and
jobs from previous batch. This is going to be very hard to get, but a
proxy for that can be got in linkedin.

How to know about these? 


## Kaushik

Fall, **Internship to do, then you need 9 months**. So eligible for
summer internship,

Spring/Winter Jan, summer gap of 2-3 months (courses in summer), from jan,

Before applying to online courses, Machine Learning, 

fall apps, jan 15, **Rolling** apps then don't go...

No GRE, TOEFL and IELTS, 

Field: Data Science, CS --> Data Science, 

What are you doing? 3 internships? Data Science co-operation, NLP

internships are cpt --> do only 365 days.

Data Science (jack of all and master of none), You can go into
anything. He claims. Look at the courses as well, Applied Machine
Learning, Business Analyst and data analyst. 

Data Science algorithms to do, pre processing, and how to get good
result, dashboards. 

Market for Data Science, cloud, Data Analyst, and engineering skills,
API pipeline, be ready for 

**Key skills** Machine Learning, Coding, Cloud, and interface
Engineering. 

**How did you choose?**

9 unis, 3 ambitious, 2 moderate, chances 3,

Chance 3 --> dallas, sunny buffalo, UC riverside,

Moderate 2 --> NE, Virginia tech (no), USC

Ambitious --> UC davis, Penn state (no), riverside (no)

You got everything?

Lesser students, **Yocket** for whatsapp uni for diff universities
(students going abroad), 

CMU (GRE 315 and 320) --> 70k a year.

**National ranking is less than 100 (USNEWS)**, Visa rejection for F1 3 of my
friends more than...

170 students for Data Science, 600 students now... 

**Costs**

50k for years --> tuition, stay --> 2bhk 6 of us 500-700$, stay NE -->
1k month, co-ops --> 30$ 60$ 40 hrs week (In your works --> ), Amazon 

**Internship**

90% talking about internship, all people I know

UT dalls get internships and good job

**Rankings**

Rankings don't matter, no one asks what, clear an interview it
doens't matter,  I don't think it depends on the college.

MSFT, Google (interviews)

mmid-size (give a lot of importance Work ex)

**Ranking**

99% got a job.

Fees to be less --> state to be less (RA or TA)

Don't think about the money right now, The way you study peer, 

struggling for my first internship, (which uni was that? Gigi)

CO-Open Philanthropy, 
full time work-ex, 

### Notes summary

**Other notes**

RA TA is a cherry on the cake, don't fully count on it, if you get it,
then great, otherwise we'll see.

Don't do more than 364 days of internship or coop.

MSFT, Google (interviews)

mmid-size (give a lot of importance Work ex)

**Internship**

He was struggling for his first internship

**North Eastern**

most got jobs already. and most of them got 1 internship at least.
He did 3 internships.

50k for years --> tuition, stay --> 2bhk 6 of us 500-700$, stay NE -->
1k month, co-ops --> 30$ 60$ 40 hrs week (In your works --> ), Amazon 

**Universities to consider**

Georgia Tech (co-op is there), North Eastern should probably be the
same if you don't

no--> he didn't get

Chance 3 --> dallas, sunny buffalo, UC riverside,

Moderate 2 --> NE, Virginia tech (no), USC

Ambitious --> UC davis, Penn state (no), riverside (no)

**Other claims**

1. CS ranking is a proxy for RA chances!
2. Don't apply to Universities which have rolling scenes
3. Data Science gives more salary why go for Data Analyst or BS, and
   focus on Data Science masters if you want to go into Data Science.
4. Internship ??? and Co-op can only start after 9 months??? How can I
   do SFO program then.
5. Rankings don't matter

**Key skills** Machine Learning, Coding, Cloud, and interface
Engineering.

## Yadnyesh: What to ask people (Tuition, GSI, )

Course, don't do winter, CPT, 

Coops --> think of

be open, freeflowing, west coast, lot of 

Data Science vs BI vs Data Analyst courses vs CS courses with Machine
Learning specialization

1 year courses vs 2 year courses? 

**What universities to consider?**

~~San Jose State~~, ~~San Deago state~~, Binghanton, State uni bufaalo, state
new york, binghamton, tony brook

SUNY (state uni of new york) look at that, 

Uflorida? 

North carlonia state

UCAlSystem, berkely, erwin, san deogo, san jose state, U washington

Talk to your advisor, 

2 assistanships, scholarship --> pythion neural 

as soon as I got my admit, I had RA -> tuition waiver (), 


professors might not have funds, 

how to know the chances?

STEM, general, 6 on the west coast, and east coast, state uni NY,
california, UF and north carolina, ucal los angeles,

Computer science, OS, DS track, (he thinks is the best)

**OPT**

Science and tech get another 12 month + 24 month (90 days before you
graduate, EAD card to work, )

**What cheap universities to consider?**

Any info about GSA from diff unis () CS ranking based on research get
have RA, TA (reducing)

Info on previous year students Success (99% jobs)

Fall (sep) vs spring impact on H1B, 

COOPS? 

VISA --> STEM website 

**What did he do?**

Learnings? clemson, choose courses, research and courses. 

Deep learning and programming, 

how hard is it? 15-20%, (wearable tech) startups, 6-7 months of
applying, few calls then, not able to convert them, Research assistant
contract was long, helping new researchers. No intership, Research
side of things, Co-ops, more companies, overall it is better out here,
seeing my friends --> industrial, computer, and , H1b is in process and 

Clemson stats

**What I care about:** Tuition, Potential for jobs, possibilities for
