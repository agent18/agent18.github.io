## Going deeper?

Ease of getting in: 
Pretty easy, as we are counting on experience to take us to the
top. Any degree seems to be good. Advantage if we have majored in say
economics or something related to marketing.

Skills: 

>A decent chance of reaching leadership positions in companies and
>good preparation for entrepreneurship.

Connections: Doesn't look very lucrative as in consulting.

Credentials: Probably boastable credentials. I saw some sales
profiles, the boasting is straightforward with things such as "grew
sales 3x or grew market share 3x"

Runway: Money is good after a "few" years, but not as prestigious or
well-paid as finance, consulting and law.

A [Sales analyst](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Sales_Analyst/Salary) makes on an average of about 40k euros. The trend
of a decently higher salary (56k Euros) at bigger companies is expected. 

other: Consider this if you are looking for good work-life balance and a future entrepreneurship

Career Capital: Every organization needs marketeers and Sales people. 

>You develop a highly transferable skill set because marketing is a
>function thatâ€™s necessary in nearly all industries.

> Transitions from one industry to the other is not completely
> straight-forward

For example, if one has to move to a non-profit, marketing here could
be based on fund-raising which could be hard when moving from the
industry. The skill-set it requires is probably different.

It is future proof as it is one that needs, social and creative
intelligence. There are decent estimates of growth (according to 80k)
for marketing managers and a 32% increase from 2012 to 2022 for
market research analysts(data science/statistics).  

Direct impact: barely possible according to 80k. They have a 1/5
rating.

Growth: 

>Marketing also often leads into general management and senior
>executive roles, which give scope for even more influence and high
>compensation.

## Example in Sales

My cousin who did his bachelors in BITS pilani and was working in the
shop floor for 3 years, managed to convince a company and got hired in
Sales. *It's is probably not that hard to get in*, and you are
probably paid low in the beginning as echoed by 80k. He has risen the
ranks considerably in 25 years. I always remembered him living in posh
places. So he earned a lot of money by Indian standards back in the
year 2000. Anyways that says nothing quantitative. At 48 he has a
green card in the US, and he was not in the US for that long even. He
was so good at his work, he was pulled in from the company in India to
work in the US on an L1 and  got his green card. His ~ 25 years of working has
landed him a green-card in the US with possibly a salary of at least
300k - 500k$, I would guess.

## Entry requirements

Ability to think and communicate very clearly (during
interview). Literally, any discipline degree is okay.

## Marketing roles

Marketing associate, Brand assistant -- client side

Marketing consultant, analyst -- agency side

## To be wary about

Harmful effects of marketing is unclear 


## Final impressions

Until 30 I want to try something crazy, out of the box, something if
it clicks then I could be somewhere else. This seems straight-forward
or a career to fall back on and not to aim for.

P.S

Wrote this directly from 80k's profile. Spent time reading the profile
and writing this post for about 1.2 hrs and then took a 45 min break,
before completing it in 20 mins.
