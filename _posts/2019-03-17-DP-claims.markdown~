That's great. So first we come up with an example (above example of
choosing between company A B) and then we check if it can be tested!

- identify what the text is not saying! the text for an example to
  pass a claim is that it should have atleast one example!

Similar to the previous sentence about "better" we again have an issue

- The goal seems to be not to understand principle of virtual works,
but to understand what I don't understand and where and why?


- we can skip certain parts that are "vague" as below or get by as

## Mission #7 

Mission #7: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
identify claims and get concrete examples to test them.

Primary target: The same work-related document as last time that you
need to understand thoroughly but currently don't. For each sentence,
identify the claim, break up any "or" and "and" into separate phrases,
get a concrete example for each, and test whether the claim is true
for that concrete example.

If the author provides a running example, hold on to it for dear life
and use it throughout that section or chapter. (When I said "running
example", did you think of Stripe and "schlep blindness" and did you
imagine going through PG's essay with that in mind? SS should have
T-ed.)

If you don't "understand" something, specify exactly on which part you
failed.

For [1], we can think of the equation of the POVW used to identify the
relationship between force (F) and stiffness (k) for the truss problem
below.

$$\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2 = F\times\delta y $$

![truss example](./images/images-DP-3/truss.jpg) 


For [2]: determining the force F at equilibrium (the truss is still)
for a given stiffness

For [3]: Energy of a spring, `$\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2$`

For [4]: Work done by the Force F, `$F\times\delta y$`

For [5]: If F increases then k increases. Contrast
this to vector mechanics, where we have to write atleast 6 equations
(`$\Sigma Fx=0$, $\Sigma Fy=0$ & $\Sigma M=0$` (2x)). In these
equations we also have the reaction forces at A and C involved, and
the forces in the truss members. We can solve all this (I can't do it
by hand, will take too long), and get a function `f(geometry, reaction
force, internal force, stiffness)=0` from which it will not be as
handy to see the effect of stiffness on the force F; unlike in the
POVW equation, owing to the several useless new terms inside (reaction
forces) 

For [6]: When you look at the POVW equation above, we are able to see
the relation between `F & k`

> the system in a global sense)[8], (disregarding the specifities)[9]
> of the (forces)[10] associated to (kinematic constraints)[11] imposed on

For [7]: the POVW equation seen above for the truss

For [8]: We look at only the **input** F and the **output** travel of spring
to balance the force. We skip the internal forces, reaction forces at
A&C for example.

For [9]: we look at the lack of internal forces or reaction forces in
the POVW equation.

For [10]: Internal forces in the truss member and the reaction forces
at A & C.

For [11]: The yellow plane does not allow Point C to move in the
horizontal direction

For [12]: the system refers to the truss members and the spring

**Claim and testing**

**Claim A**

>{(The variational approach)[1] to (mechanics)[2] is based on the
> (concepts of energy)[3] and (work)[4]}(A)

In the example below we clearly see the usage of energy and work to
identify the relationship between F and k. 

$$\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2 = F\times\delta y $$

**Claim B**

> The variational approach to mechanics is based on the concepts of
> energy and therefore (provides a better understanding)[5] of
> (mechanical phenomena)[6]}(B)

We have seen above that the usage of vector mechanics makes it hard to
understand the mechanical relationship between F and k [6] owing to
the presence of reaction and internal forces. When we use the
variational approach we see the relationship between F and k. When F
increases k increases as the geometry part (dx, dy) is a constant.

*is the writing (in quotes) considered as poor writing? due to the
lack of comparison of the variational approach to something?*

**Claim C**

> In some sense one can say that {(variational principles)[7]
> (consider the system in a global sense)[8], (disregarding the
> specifities)[9] of the (forces)[10] associated to (kinematic
> constraints imposed on the system)[11,12]}(C)

The variational principles allow for the following equation:

$$\frac{1}{2} k \times dx^2 = F\times\delta y $$

which considers the system based on input and output[8], not bothering
about the reaction forces that are generated at C and A imposed by the
yellow plane.

For 4, think of the motion equation of a single pendulum

$ml^2 \ddot{\theta} +mgl \sin{\theta}=0$ 

For 1 and 3, think of the derivation of the motion equations for a
simple pendulum using the POVW approach. - pg 22 Mechanical Vibrations
by Daniel Rixen

For 5, imagine a double pendulum.

For 5a, with a simple pendulum we deal with a 1x1 matrix (basically
not a matrix) in the derivation, which is very easy to work out by
hand, but with a double pendulum , we deal with 2x2 matrices which is
hard to keep track of with a double pendulum, in the derivation of
motion equations.

![double pendulum](./images/images-DP-3/dp.png)

For 2: when we use the POVW to derive the motion equations of a double
pendulum we have 2 equations in the end which need to be solved. When
we use the newton-euler equations we quickly see that we need to
construct 6 equations and solve them simultaneously.

For 6a, we think of the derivation of motion equations for a double
pendulum using the POVW.

for 6, we imagine giving the output of the variational approach (the
differntial equation) to a computer to solve

For 7a,

"Numerical solution:

let's guess 𝑥=1: 𝑓(1)=1−5=−4. A negative number. Let's guess 𝑥=6: 𝑓(6)=6−5=1. A positive number.

The answer must be between them. Let's try 𝑥=6+12: 𝑓(72)<0
So it must be between 72 and 6...etc.

This is called bisection method." - [Stack](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/935458/332456)'

*Here I would actually try to show solving the equation of motion
using exact and numerical methods and show what is meant by
approximation, but I need more time to re-understand how to use them,
so I have not done them*

For 7, [Runge Kutta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)

For 8, solution for $ml^2 \ddot{\theta} +mgl \sin{\theta}=0$ will look
something like $\theta(t)=\theta_0 \cos{(\omega t + \phi)}$, where
$\omega$ and $\phi$ need to be determined.

For 9, we think of a double pendulum

For 10, we think of a beam with a time-varying force $F=F_0
\sin{\omega t}$

For 11, it is not clear what the intention of the author is, so we
skip it

*I don't know what example to give for "gives rise to"! Does it need
an example? I am here thinking what does "giving rise to look like"*


**Claim A**

> - (It)[6a] (gives rise to)[6] (approximate)[7a] (numerical methods)[7] for the (solution)[8] of
> both (discrete)[9] and (continuous systems)[10] in the (most natural manner)[11],
> as will be later explained in Chapters 5 and 6.

Claim AA: Variational approach gives rise to approximate numerical
methods for the solution of discrete systems.

Claim AB: Variational approach gives rise to approximate numerical methods for the solution
of continuous systems.

If you take a double pendulum[9], and produce the motion equations with
POVW[6a], you get 

![double pendulum](./images/images-DP-3/dp.png)

When you give this to a MATLAB[6] it will use Runge-Kutta  (or similar
techniques)[7,7a] to find the $\theta\_1$ & $\theta\_2$ at say t=1s [8].

A continuous system like a beam with a varying load is split into finite discrete elements
(100 elements), following which it is treated like a discrete system
which is "approximate"as above.
