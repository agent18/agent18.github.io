## You can always do more

Shindler was a nazi himself and somehow he decided to do good and
ended up freeing 1100 jews. He could have done more (as he realizes
himself).

"There will be generations because of what you did". But Shindler felt
it was not enough. **I agree**. How can you stop, how can you face
those people and tell them "I had to buy an expensive car", "I want to
go on a vacation"?

Jeff Kaufman and his wife Julia have pledged 30% of their income and
continue to however do [~50% for the last 8 years](https://www.jefftk.com/donations). Wow, but could
they do more? **Certainly**. Consider how selfish Jeff is by saying
the following, regarding the constraints for him to find a new job.

45hrs per week? Man GTFO! In addition he chose to have 2 kids, a wife,
a mortgage, and plays the banjo guitar at his local community. Man, he
could be grinding to become better.

Julia Wise when she was an intern at the psychiatric hospital,
"refused" to keep a patient company because she had to get to the bus.

Really! a bit more of your time, valikudha (hurts is it)? Why so
selfish.

I went to an EA group in holland once and the guy who was running the
show said he gave 10%, I was like (in my head) "bro common, you run an
EA group, standards man".

Clearly everyone could be doing more. But how much more?

## How much more?

For me to *do more* (maxing out) in my life I could do the following:

1. Increasing total earnings by "becoming great"
2. Increasing percentage of donation to a very high value

Increasing earnings by "becoming great" is not going to be easy. We
are talking about working for years on end without "burning
out". 10-12 hrs a day for the rest of your life. How long can you
**sustain** this? (assuming I know what exactly to practice
on and how to practice it).

I think of the last 2 months which was a really stressful and an
anxious period of my life where I was applying for jobs (doing
interviews, getting rejections) while working a full time job (as I
picked up a new role and had to deliver what I promised). I probably
did 11-12 hours on many weekdays and 4-8 hours on the weekends. THIS
sort of lifestyle, is ok for 2 months, but after that I needed a
break. I was so looking forward to being done with this shit. It was
exhausting.

If I look at my past, grinding for weeks on end at "max capacity" has
always crashed and I eventually slack, feel like shit and give in to
days where I do absolutely didly squat. I am unable to sustain the
motivation at such a high level for a few weeks together, let alone
few years.

You also need to make other sacrifices. Working at "such a high level"
(assuming we do) means optimizing your life by not wasting time doing
things like meeting friends and spending an evening with them. In the
past two months I reduced social interactions to a great extent (once
in 2-3 weeks), but I don't want to be like this. I clearly long for
social interactions (once a week or so). Even in those times of hard
grind, I sometimes couldn't just do my work (like a robot) and went to
my friends house to just chat or have a beer. Clearly it is "somewhat
important" to me.

**Bottomline**: It's going to be hard to sustain grinding for years on
end.

---

Increasing the donation percentage to very high numbers is going to be
hard to **sustain** as well. Think donating 50%.

I didn't do the calculations but I am afraid this might mean
optimizing my life to the point that I might have to live with others,
or perhaps even having to make my own food and reduce outside eatings
and celebrations. In any case,

What if this makes me feel really miserable? 
What if I loose my job in the US and can't keep up with the 50% anymore?  
What if the DS salaries fall for some reason in the future?  
What if I am burned out, but I still need to continue pushing cause
"vaaku kuduthutain velu" (meaning "I gave my word").  
What if I want to take a holiday? A breather after 2 months of intense
grind?
And what about the stress and sustaining it?

Is this going to be sustainable though? Am I going to be feel good to
continue doing it at "such a high level" for years on end?

---

Understand you are not a robot and don't hate yourself for not having
the "Jeff Kaufman gene"? I want to be like the superstar, Jeff
Kaufman, I want to max out and feel exhausted like when I do in some
runs, but how long can you sustain maxing out day in and day out? I
had to scale back on my running goals so that I can do it often rather
than develop this hatred towards running and not do it at all.

There are people like Jeff Kaufman who are able to pull off a 50%
donation (with ease I guess). Somehow they have the
motivation. However am I like Jeff Kaufman? Do I have his
motivation. Perhaps Jeff Kaufman is like a corner case? Look at your
past perhaps.

> Know your limits, master wayne.

I don't want to set myself up for failure and feel like shit. And
at the same time I would like to do a lot.

So what now?

## So, how much could be good enough

I like the idea of sustainability over a long term than burning out
and panicking. Doing less for longer, than doing max till I
burnout. This doesn't sound all that fancy. In fact it sounds
lame. Grinding, on the other hand is hot; Doing small amounts for
longer is not. But I am afraid the latter is sustainable.

When Julia asked her supervisor if she should have stayed back and
kept the patient company, the supervisor said, "Go home when it's time
to go home. There will always be someone who wants you to stay. You
can't come in here and do a good job if you're worn out from the day
before." Julia adds further,

> To me, that's an example of what one [author](https://books.google.com/books?id=fHqQAgAAQBAJ&dq=boundaries+and+self-care&lr=) on burnout calls
> "boundaried generosity." I will give my best up until this point,
> and then I will stop. That's what makes high-intensity,

[Slate Star Codex seems to be saying something similar](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/). Commit to
10% of earnings and that is it. No talk about increasing earnings,
working, or whatever. Your moral duty to help other people is
satisfied. You don't need to volunteer, protest or donate anything
else to any other cause if you don't want to.

10% is sustainable I think. I can personally lead a great life not
hold back on expenses (I think) and save a generous amount for the
future, for future contingencies. It lifts off the pressure to go ham
every single day, and perhaps eventually fail and feel like shit. I
think 10% is achievable (I have done it in the past).

## Why exactly 10%?

(I mean I am not going to articulate it any better than the MAN himself.)

## Why not do more?

I guess I can certainly do more, but we'll have to evaluate if it is
going to be sustainable. Let's stick to 10% and lets' take it from
there.

Like Jeff Kaufman, I would like to commit to a percentage but try to
do more. 

> We've pledged to donate 30% of our income, but we've been targeting 50%.

For far too long I have romanticized the idea of grinders. Grind being
the only lifestyle that I respect. Being great and giving away as much
as possible. But what about actually sustaining it over long times?
I guess there are limits (motivation, injuries etc.). Limits that
I refused to believe are going to affect me in the past. Limits that I
assumed at some future point I would have figured out how to
conquer. Limits I thought were my flaws.

And there is no need to feel like shit because you are ~~only~~
committing to 10%. EA is not about 1 person winning, it is about the
entire community winning for billions and billions of years.

## But, how can you tell a person in need to Fuck off?

It feels cruel to say to stop with 10%, or leave home at 5pm cause you
have to catch the bus, or work 45 hrs a week ~~only~~, or for
Shindler ~~only~~ to save 1100 jews.

> But Shindler, there are 1100 families. Think about their
> generations.

Think about doing something sustainable. Commit to something and stop
feeling like shit. We are not robots, unfortunately. :)
