## Possible stages, information that you would ask , and how you would
ask for this





Hi, 

This is r2d2s from [Happier Lives Institute](https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/), an organization that
researches, evaluates and recommends funds, to the most cost-effective
ways for making people happier.

As part of our research we believe [Thinking Healthy Programme](https://www.mhinnovation.net/innovations/thinking-healthy-programme)
(THP), to be [very effective](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uzLRw7cjpKnsuM7c3/hli-s-mental-health-programme-evaluation-project-update-on). And we were informed by \*\*\*\*
that [Mata Jai Kaur](https://matajaikaur.org/) works on THP.

To understand that if we are a fit for each other, we seek more
information about you. But there seems to be little information that
we could find on your website ([p42 of your 2017 report](https://matajaikaur.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MJK-2017-Report.pdf)).

We thus ask your hand in cooperation to help us with the information
needed to accurately understand and perhaps evaluate your THP
intervention.

Please let us know if you are able to work with us in our attempt to
make more people happier.

Thank You for your time. 

Regards,
r2d2s
