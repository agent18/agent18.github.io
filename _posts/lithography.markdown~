## body

1. design of experiements (56 jobs)
root cause analysis

make recommendation, create data impact, insights
statistics

hypothesis testing

deisgn

correlation analysis

drivers (feature importation types)

A/B testing hypothesis (randomised unbiased) truly unbiased outcome,
causal. 


2. ""productivity improvement projects and the work typically involves
   a lot of (machine and customer) data crunching, detailed breakdowns
   of tact time of stages, handlers and track, bottle neck analyses
   and the creation of options and solutions to enhance throughput and
   output""
   
   Customer support
   
   hands dirty with data (difficult data) comprehensive data
   story.... workign with unclean data answer data.
   
3. I look at data from ASML's customers to suggest customised
   productivity improvements based on their usage of lithography
   machines. I am involved in new product introduction, and multiple
   stages of the product generation process. I also do data analysis
   and reporting as part of application and business support.
   
   
4. Data mining with some home made tools, to suggest improvements

Writing queries, cleaning, manipulating it, adding features, if
required data products, making insights and presenting it

Full stack data analyst --> ^^^^ good analysis...  ML and more
statistical rigor is Dat scientist.

operations analyst --> understands data to create impact...

You will be sucked into domain...


Big data ()

## lith

In device and on-product metrology

 

In-device --> using actual device repetitive features not specific marks

On-product metrology --> using marks placed inbetween chips

 

Machine overlay --> overlay within the machine scanner

On-product overlay --> actual overlay over the entire process

1. **Cleaning** H202 cleaning the substrate

2. Layer of silicon (masking film)

3. **Preparation: HDMS** (increase adhesion of photoresits) RRC reduce resist
   consumption
   
4. **Coating and prebake** photo resist --> thin coating (0.5 to 2.5 um)

5. extra photo resist is removed edge bead removal (FLAT LAYER)

6. pre bake (drive off excess photo resist)

7. **Exposing:  light** --> conddenser lens (collimated beath) --> photo mask -->
   projection lens --> photo resist has a pattern now
   
8. **Development:** wash away exposed parts of the photoresist (+ve
   resist) (soluble photoresist)

9. **etching process**: remove upper most layer of substrate (silicon)
   unprotected by photoresist
   
10. **Photoresist Cleaning** remove insoluble photoresist


11. SiO2 is deposited  --> so we have Si unexposed region and Si02 in
    the exposed region gaps

12. make several layers

13. Etch SiO2 to reveal 3d stretcher.

### terminology

- camera stepper or scanner that projects an image of photomast onto photoresist
