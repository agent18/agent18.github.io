## Entry question

What should I do now?

## 

I have estimates but there are guess in it (so I think of them as
Fermi estimates), I possibly also didnt consider some things, things
can change in the future. All things considered a factor of 10 is the
expected how off I am. I could be biased etc...

This is the final estimation I have from this article.

{:.tablestyletwo}
| Effective value                | low      | BGE      | high     |
|--------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| DS Masters                     | 713k     | 741k     | 865k     |
| DS L1                          | 642k     | 662k     | 875k     |
| GW Researcher                  | 914k     | 1.43m    | 1.95k    |

With GIVEWELL Researcher of course there are many guesses, literally
things I pull out of my ass such as "counterfactual contribution of
GiveWell", "counterfactual contribution of Researcher" and "even
contribution of a researcher". I tried doing a "better" job here (in
another post), but also ended up with the same type of contributions
which I need to fermi like estiamte. 

Fermi estimates are usually off by a factor upto 10. So taking that as
the hard bound then, we are literally looking at 1.95m or 195k. The
sad thing is I will NEVER know.

Comparing this to say Data Science masters route, which also has
estimates, but reasonably based on the past. Such as getting a faang
job after 2-4 years, I think I have seen enough people land in the
Faang sector who started with me in school (who were "my level" going
to an ok college and masters and then Microsoft, intel etc...). I am
sure they worked hard and that it was stressful and shit but they made
it. Even my brother after 2 years is in apple, sil in paypal, where
they get paid really good. 

Amount donable for example I assume to be 30%. I know one example
where Jeff kaufman, even recessions and other things are much more
based on history. You can get "reasonable prolties" for this as there
is some if not great dater.

The good thing about Data Science is i will know exactly how much
money I am able to pump. 

Research could however provide me opportunities to have more
counterfactual impact in the sense that I could one day found an
organization, but again all the previous accusations of research work
being less tractable still exists. So I don't know if I am doing good
or bad.

EA so far seems really competitive. The general competitiveness is
well established in other posts, and even my personal score is only
clearing first few interviews but failing at the rational and actual
research aspects. Of course I can skill up? Can I?

## upskilling

Upskilling an STM seems to claim is harder with EA than is with Data
Science. I don't know how to test this... Perhaps I should find a way.

I mean I had the worst experience with predicting what is required to
get a job in the Data Science market. Ended up not getting
much. Perhaps I should try a bit more.

1. It seems hard to predict how to get in

2. Can I actually get the skills? Do you know what skills are
   required? Is spending 1-3 years worthh testing out my personal fit,
   if I can,
   
   What if I don't like job? I mean just working with all sorts of
   uncertainty can only get you so far, as this guy from RP saulius
   said.
   
## Personal fit

Arun gertler told me something like this one year back. Peter also
suggested something similar, Now STM is also suggesting you can't
really know as things are off by factor 10 bro. And this is a close
call. So maybe it makes sense to go the Data Science route?

however with the Data Science route I am concerned about making it in
the US, with the probabilities from 



if with Data Science it is true that one can get ahead by practicing
and there are ways to practice, then I think maybe there is hope for
me. maybe. practice with feedback... with practice with EA it does
seem vague, ohw to get there with writing, GIVEWELL research. Maybe it
will work out, but I don't know the impact anyways.

If Data Science is as tractable as they say, and even if after my
masters I fall down, IF I AM GREAT I shold be able to make it to US? I
know a few people who moved through the L1 route, with a degree in
India. One guy is in apple so much so that he is making the big racks
and doesn't even have a CS degree. via L1. There could still be ways
to get you in to the US, provided you are "GREAT"(what ever that
means). This guy got a job in nvidia purely becuase his kaggle level
was god mode. 

Chris Olah although he is a legend made it to the US wihtout an
undergrad degree with an alien with extrordinary ability, I am just
saying there are examples who are great who made it to the US.


This whole shit about being great and getting a US visum needs to be
quantified, and I think it is possible. Looking at all the
examples. But I need to do that. Maybe it even takes until 40 years to
get there, but the wait might be worth it if I am making fucking 500k
a year where I hopefully can donate half (god willing). Everything I
do here is meaningless as soon as I get a job in US.


So trying to be great is the key. What it means to be great needs a
lot of work. But lets do it pandian.. ... . . . .  money WILL come
back. Just go behind extrodinary ability.


Just freaking 3-4 years at 250k donations is all I need to meet the
"lowerbound" claimd thing by EA researcher. I'll take it. Working hard
and not counting any of my previous stuff seems to be the key. 

In addition I would be "good at rationality" in 10 years, statistics
and understanding claims, this will all hopefully allow me to also
invest etc... If I put my mind to it perhaps there is a lot of scope
to make and grow money. STM is also there, hopefully we can talk and
there is always EA support to get there. Lets' jump bro. Lets'

Next what I am going to do is isolate different aspects of this thing
that I have written, arrange them and start rewreiting. I mean this is
the "crux" of the shit.



Increasing odds my trying many times? to go to US, Masters and L1 for
example?

Wiht masters I think I will have less time to develop concentratedly
the skills I need. Let's look into a 1 year masters. or a part time masters.


Write to Data Science in google ask them what I need to do to get
intot gokul in the next 5 years... Someone will fucking BITE... 


Value drift? Well what can I test now to know that I am going to be
ok? The general claim is it is hard to do this forever. How the fuck
do you know this... Over the last 5 yeasr I would be easily averaging
2 hrs a day. Wihtout flinching an eye.  I mean some days it is hard, I
think htat is cause I don't know what I am working on, even DP days I
think have been pretty good as they are engrossing. Vague shit is
hard, (like writing an essay and exploring what I need to do), not
knowing exactly what to do, and needing a pomodoro to help
you. Yesterday for example was shit. but today it seems ok. And leave
all feelings aside, for thelast 5 weeks I have been systematically
making comitments and almost succeeding at them. but the fact that I
am and continuing to do this... Stop thinging that 5 years from now I
will feel like this life suclks... shut up... I have made it in the
last 5 years. I am fine... This is in fact better than not having to
do anything and bve like pal and feel bored out of my shit. I have a
purpose bro. 

I will become better at rationality alongside Data Science., I am
going to solve the problems with motivation. I am not going to have
value drift what that means... I am oging to ocntinue this being 1 day
I can plan an event, but if I don't that is great.

focus on one thing and ACE it ACe!



Quantity and then comes quality, god bless. Always. Just vomit and
then clean up. I came to the idea of fermi being off by 10 only
beacuse I wrote, so calm the fuck, down. It's the uninted
consequences of why we should continue writing, not sure which
direction to go. God bless.  also realizing that the way I want to
write and things start becoming clear when I do claim example type
stuff. God bless.
 
 
I was hoping I guess that women, but I don't need it, ofr the pleasure
of a few mins I am not going to put my whole life in shit. thats
another essay, but let's leave that alone.


After this essay we continue with the shit... 

Of course we need to come back to cleaning this up, claims and trying
to have a structure, this way, I can start writing the article
properly even.

I often make the mistake of thinking about the future and saying oh I
wont have it ever, like women or value drift over time. But to all
those claims I say, look at the past. I am fine bro. I will be fine,
persuation, just stay away from it. It is strong, but know that once
you release the feeling is gone. 

> he can take it

I mean he could take it for the last few days, for the last year or
so, maybe I was closing myself, maybe I should continue to close
myself. Not in EA brother, but that is ok. Not al spouses of EA boys
are deeply into this.

## 

Whats the plan your honor?

I have a guess on what is the potential impact in some cases. I have
decent numbers in the US case I think. I am not sure. And lot of
guesses in the other case.

As they are in theory fermi estiamtes, I really can't do much about
it. I can't really get better estimates and I will never ever get to
know what the right answer is for some estimates as they involve
counterfactual thinking.

One thing I realized when I was doing this fermi estiamte is that this
is probably how it is going to be while doing this type of
research. Many vague numbers and "there is no way to check" types. for
example the counterfactual percentage. 

In addition to this STM has said give up this researcher thingy and go
behind Data Science as the skills are atleast manageable. Not sure
what he means, but we can "test" this.

I have with me 5 + 6 + 5 + 5 hrs left to write about it, sort of a
conclusion, for this i want to know somethings, which are most
important. I am really going to time box this. I am really going to
time box this. And that way I can try to focus on the most important
things just like in a real job. 

## What I would like to know

- Impact of Data Science
- Impact of Researcher
- Effective value with Data Science 
- Effective value as Researcher taking into account everything.

- looking into claims such as what sort of earning potential do I
  have if I am unable to make it to the US?
- looking into claims about what I can get feedback in  and what I can
  "grow to my max potential in"?
  
- should I do masters or try the L1 route?

I am afraid my mind is made up. But I need to answer this my
self. That is about it... maybe out of scope...

- impact of Researcher is clear so far. I  want to look into effective
  value calculations and see if I can simplify it with smaller
  probabilities?
  
- how good is the effective value of Data Science?

	- how good is the impact of a Data Science career in US?
  
## Data Science in NETHERLANDS

I would think I would end up with 315k modest donations over my
lifetime (minimum). I could try the masters route?

Are there other countries where we have high earning potential?

How long does it take to setup a masters? 

how easy is it to get a canadaian pr?

## Salaries in other countries

## Planning

- I will look at effective value of a researcher first.

Data Science for life? let's do it...

Answer claims? 

## Making the Case for Data Science vs Ea

**Claim**: EA lack of feedback to practice EA skills than Data
Science?

**Claim**: there are a lot of guesses for Ea 

**Claim**: tyhere are not lot of guesses for Data Science

What do I do when all shit goes loose? Impact when US is not an
option???? Very important and what is the probability with that?

And the other option is comparing the EA vs US worst case... Is all I
want to know. 

I can check todays estimate. I could be wrong but that is one thing I
can verify!

## side

Girls, bro these thougths consume you... you know that, you think of
them in the middle of nowhere. That's not what I want to be doing. i
want to do other thing s in life like the ones where we are going to
be focussed in the important things in life.
