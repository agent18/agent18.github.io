#### Problems with Dell Latitude E5430

- Ram is low when using multiple tabs on chrome
- 2 year life
- cannot sleep over night, always needs a charging usually. Could be
software related.
- It looks like am going to be doing DS so might need decent ram to
  prep and do courses with some extra visualization.(I suspect)
- Cant play games
- Needs to be returned asap.

#### Pros

- Ubuntu setup is ready
- Laptop is movable and looks stirdy enough to go on for the next 2
  years!



#### arg for buying
- I have to buy it now or I am going to be losing 200 bucks
- Urgency comes hence!
- I need a computer with 8 gig ram atleast and at it I would like a
  proper graphics card t
  


#### arg agains buying

- I don't know if I should be gaming! and investing for it
- Money, why spend 900 bucks! fuck me!
- Gaming consumes lot of time. 
	
	
#### Why are you really buying a laptop?

Would not buy a laptop with a decent enough graphics card and 8 gb
ram?

Well if I put in some more money I can buy a gaming laptop, so why
not. For a few more hundred I can get more !


### Buying laptop in india

It appears that I might save 100 bucks. and will haev to go through a
lot of struggle to ensure saving that. 

100 bucks I spent without thinking in so many places. It is not really
worth that much to me. And I don't want to be spending time looking at
how to save that! Nahmean

Plus here I can return try etcc... as needed. Which I prefer, as I
don't know what works and what doesn't with ubunut dual booting and
stuff!

If I buy in india, then I ahve to return it there, and cannot have
more than 2 iterations, and that will already be pushing it.

### Spedngin time on discounts

max I should be able to get 50 bucks of discount!

#### To check

Warranty, guarentee, return policy confirmation

Check on tweakers for lowest price!

#### Difference between gaming and normal laptop?

#### Will you even  buy the laptop if you don't need gaming?

Absolutely not!

So I think I am primarily in this "buy-now-or-else" phase, and I think
I am having to make a decision right now.

how much do you care about 200 bucks?

Right now I should not care about wasting anything. It is worth 200
bucks only and thats it, no CO2 costs and shit like that!

I am not sure if I wan tto game, if I will need a higher ram /
graphics to do DS projections.

I am worried about having to buy something then. I want to buy now and
get over with this!


### Summary:

Laptop has problems like battery and life in general and inability to
sleep and hang ram. 

Dont use chrome, change battery as needed and wait for those 2 years
to get over are common suggestions

a) If I keep this and if I have to buy a new laptop, waste of money

b) if I send this back and buy a new laptop with gaming (>200 bucks),
best use of money

c) 

Important goals in the next few months, decide what to do. and do it!
I cannot waste any more time. 200 bucks is nothing in the long run. I
barely value this money, looking at having spent 250 bucks to see
terror, and 

The argument I hear from underneath is that ?

If you decide then to buy a laptop again, you could have bought a
laptop for 1050 bucks instead, which would be a kickasser laptop.

I would barely notice the difference between 850 and 1050 bucks. Yes
it would be faster and I can play in ultra HD. Well is that really
needed! 

Setting up the new laptop will take another week atleast! 

Sleep issue seems to be kernel related!


Spending 200 now and then in a few months spending more ...

Why not just buy the new system if money is not an issue.. I dont want
to rush. I am being forced by deadlines to make a decision. And I
don't want o 




#### Judge by impact:

Cost of one hour 15 euros

Cost 


Biggest goals: get work done. 


Biggest fear: loose 200 bucks, as this laptop doesn't look like its
gonna get any better with sleep and ram


#### Problem

Unable to decide if I should buy a laptop(gaming) or keep existing
laptop.

Laying down pros and cons is not working. I have been doing that and
that sucks!

#### Solution

Impact is king apparently. What is the impact you want.

What is most important to you right now and do you have the means to
acheive it?

YEs. I suspect it will take two more weeks of writing before I know
what I will be doing in life. 

If it is an MBA, then I don't need a new laptop.

If it is a DS, then I might need a proper laptop. 

**Would you need a new laptop?**

P of choosing DS = 0.7

P of choosing needing a better laptop  = 0.6

P of ram not enough = 0.8

P of needing a new laptop = 0.7*0.6*0.8 = 0.336 right now

P of need a new laptop at a later date = 0.5 atleast, else I wouldn't
buy then

**It is also nice to game, instead of youtube, have a proper reward?**

You need a laptop irrespective, in that case.


P of reward working to improve motivation and get me to write everyday
= 0.5


**Value from laptop if I buy now**

Value = P of needing a new laptop * cost of laptop 

**Value of laptop later**

-200 euro now + P of needing a new laptop * cost of laptop = 


Cost now = Cos to laptop- refund from disfunc laptop + setting up
time + P(this system not working)* costs involved in getting another
laptop

Costs of getting another laptop:

- research time (1 hr)
- Time of buying and seting up (15 hrs)
- cost per hr now 15$
- cost per hr later 10$
- anxiety of sending the package 20$
- cost of new latpop
- refund of old laptop

P (the new system not working and needs return) = 0.05
 
Cost now assuming 100% probability laptop is needed =  15$x 15 hrs + 20$ + 850$ -200 $ + 0.05 (15x15+20) = 907.25

Cost later assuming 100% probability the laptop is not needed = 10$x15hrs + 850$ + 0.05 (10x15+20) = 1008.5 

Time now is worth atleast 1.5 times than later

But the probability that the laptop is needed now is  0.336

Actual value including P of needing NOW = 0.336x907 = 305

Actual value including P of needing LATER = 0.5x1008.5 = 504.25

Cost of failure = (1-0.336)x907 = 598

Cost of failure later = (0.5)*1008 = 504

Cost of failure will be higher now considering gaming
probability. Probability of knowing if I need it will increase in the
next few months.. So for the cost of failure now, the initial
probability of not needing games is 0.5 and later will be about 

So there are 4 situations:

- I buy now and I don't need = 0.66
- I buy now and I need = 0.33
- I buy later and I need = 0.
- I buy later and I don't need =


value = (850-200) * (0.336*0.4)

Value later = *700 850 * ()


#### 

I am considering buying a laptop. This laptop might just do. But there
are two other things that are forcing me to buy a laptop.

### New laptop

- ability to game!
- ability to DS for sure to a "good extent"
- no lag due to ram
- Speed is too good
- Cost 850-200 
- life: 4-5 years


Basically gaming: 650 + 15$*15hrs +2*50 5 years

per year: 975/5 = 195 per year

### Old laptop

- no ability to game
- possible inability to DS (graphics wise)
- ability to lag because of ram! (70Euro) can be upgraded| Already see
  signs of lagging when using a couple of heavy sights on crome!
- Speed is fine for my current level
- Cost = 0
- life 2 years
- Laptop doesn't sleep, I think problem with OS kernel, no solution
  worked yet! But there are work arounds and I don't really care too
  much regarding this for now, as 

+70$ + 50$ + 200$ +$10*15 hrs 2 years

Price per year = 



#### Goal

- Career direction 9/10
- increased motivation using laptop 6/10
- ability to DS in high graphics?

There are some indicators indication, that I am primarily doing this
for gaming!


I am looking for evidence that a laptop will change my life? gaming
will change my life?  other than the fact that it can act as a
motivator, I don't see any! When I see in the past, there have been
many interesting things to do at the end of the day. There have been
days when I had planned events happening in the eve and I basically
just procrastinated until shit got real! I always do that. I am very
excited to game, no doubt, I am sure it can give me countless hours of
gaming. I suspect this could be the problem with gaming as well. 

Writing is hard work, thinking is harwork. Yes it is exciting or
gripping many a time, but I still need to get out of my bed to do
stuff and I have been sucking at it for the past so many months.  I
can hope that things change, once and for all. Also, I see gaming as a
much more desirable reward than everything I have done. 

Making the reward real, in the sense that I make agreements with my
friend that I will only use it to reward me.

It is a costly experiment worth 650 bucks.

The events that I mentioned earlier, might not be as powerful as 

a gaming device suddenly seems dangerous! Money is seriously not a big
deal for me. But good decisions are...


####

Granted I woudl not have anything to look forward to! No source of
proper entertainment to cheer up an Agent and to allow him to do
amazing work, but there is no evidence.


#### The value of gaming

- Flow
- reward at the end of the day

 Based on the evidence for procrastination I deem the probabbility of
 this working as 50%, which I think is far far conservative number
 based on the only thing 
 
 
 based on my calculation, I need a 3x imporovement in everyday writing
 @ 50% probability for buying a laptop to be worth it!


#### The finisher


I claim that if I do 9 hours now as opposed to 6 hours. I suspect that
gaming is going to do any of this. I am worried it might even make the
score negative. 

Second, if I buy now I might end up spending a lot of time fixing the
computer, which I could be using to write the summary


I have to spend 800 bucks on a laptop which seems right now purely for
gaming. I think what I should do is for now

I think it will be a good addition to my life though.

Am I ready...

I am afraid its just the consumerism high that I am getting

I have never made such a decision in my life, to go against, what I
feel! Let me start. The evidence is scary

I am not ready to make a commitment for 2 months and then buy the
laptop. I am afraid it is not going to do anything to motivate me,
atleast it shows my confidence. IT sppears that I would still need to
go to the library or be somewhere else to get the job done.

Unless gaming can improve your life, we dont buy it! period!

ok! 200$ doesn't fucking matter to you! right! yes! in the long
run. Buy something for yourself or treat yourself, if you get work
done. Use the 800 $ budget to kill. Say you will spend the next 2
weeks killing it for a godforsaken laptop.

First kill then buy. Without killing there is no point buying!
