## ***Entry question*** : How to get posting after installing jekyll.

---


## Github pages

1) Follow githubpages word to word to make agent18.github.io work. And now we have "hellow world" displaying in the website.

Note: Cloned folder is also called username.github.io

## Jekyll 
(http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/)

After installing Jekyll(fingers crossed), type the commands below as found in  http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/ or below:
	

	$ jekyll new myblog
	$ cd myblog
	$ jekyll serve

- myblog is now a folder you created with basic file structure of jekyll in it.
- "Serve"  hosts the site locally. Serve also watches for changes you make and updates the local site.
- The command below puts the files in the github cloned folder that exists on your pc.

	$ jekyll build -d ¨full directory without courts or anything¨

## Github and jekyll


Once it does the above, then you can use the following to send it to your repo(sitory). Go to username.githun.io folder then;

	$ git add --all
	$ git commit -m ¨Initial commit¨
	$ git push -u origin master

Username and then password and then go to username.github.io and it works like a charm.
