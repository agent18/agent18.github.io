## Issues

### Could be issues hypothetical or from past

> There are (many issues)[1] we haven’t been able to look into yet, so
> we expect there are other (high-impact areas we haven’t
> listed)[3].

**Claim**: There could be other [3].

**Question**: Could there be other [3]?

**Example A**: Until a few years back 80khours thought that the best
places to work on were "reducing near-term life risks aka reducing
global health risks" but when they explored that there were global
catastrophic risks that could kill the entire planet and future
generations, they have now changed their stance on where people should
be working considering the impact.

**Example Hypothetical**: If medical research into 'how to slow aging' seems
largely promising (90% chance of making it with 10b <span>$</span>
with a 100 people extra), in delivering a mechanism that doubles the
human life expectancy, it could be beneficial to work on it as it
could save `95% * 7b expected people lives/100 = 66m expected people
lives per person working on it`

*In this case, I could give a hypothetical example or an example from
the past, which is what I have done here. Can you comment?*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Because

**Claim**: Due to [1], it is good to work on [2].

*because*

We skip these with just that word there


### Given AB

**Claim**: Given [1] and [2], it appears that following [3] is a good
place for [4].

**Question**: Is following [3], a good place for [4]?

*I am not sure how to give an example Given [1] and [2]. So I skip
this for now.*

### Bad writing vague words

> Given our take on (the world’s most pressing problems)[1] and the
> (most pressing bottlenecks these issues face)[2], we think the
> following (five broad categories of career)[3] are a good place to
> (start generating ideas)[4] if (you have the flexibility to consider a

**Claim**: It appears that following [3], is a good place for [4].

**Question**: Is following [3], a good place for [4], if [5]?

*What does 4, even mean? What is the point of it?* Should I bother
myself or skip these type of seemingly shit sentences. Who cares about
generating ideas? why?

### In general

> (Many of the top problem areas we focus on)[1] are mainly (constrained by
> a need for additional research)[2], and we’ve argued that (research)[3] seems
> like a high-impact path in general)[4].

**Claim**: [3] seems like [4].

**Example**: Working in MIRI as a researcher could save 57k lives and
has a bang-for-the-buck as compared to Climate change (about 1000
times better).

*I don't know what general means so I skip it!*


### Contrasting

> roles.

**Claim**: It is good to [1] in [2].

**Example**: As discussed earlier, AI safety is really quite neglected
with 100 people working on it with 10m <span>$</span>. Neil Bowerman
from 80khours is trying to add people required to fill the "talent
gaps". If Neil is able to add 10 more people and even claim 1% of
their total impact that would be 570 lives saved just for his work in
a few years. Contrast that to a DS job which saves 400 people 

*I think it is important to contrast it with something otherwise it is
hard for someone to understand if it is good or bad. Agree: to always
contrast?*

### How useful

> You can also (support the work of other researchers)[1] in a
> (complementary role, such as a project manager, executive assistant,
> fundraiser or operations)[2]. We’ve argued (these roles)[3] are often
> neglected, and therefore especially high-impact. It’s often useful

> roles.

**Claim**: It is useful to have [4] before [3].

**Example**: 

**Split**: 

For [4] before [3]: Neil Bowerman has a PhD (equivalent) in Physics,
where he worked on existential risks of extreme climate change with a
focus on providing emission targets.

Also Sean O hEigeartaigh, from CSER has a PhD in Genome Evolution, he
is also known to increase the number of people at FHI and secure
rougly 3m <span>$</span> in funding. Now he is completely in
operations such as grantwriting, fundraising, long-term planning
etc...

*Not sure how "useful" [4] is before [3]! or how to even go about answering
it!*

This seems to be exactly what happened with Rob Mather from AMF who
claimed that his sales experience helped him.


### facts

> (Mozart)[8] scored a (130 percent on the precocity index)[9] whereas
> (his current contemporaries)[10] scored (thirty to five-hundred
> percent)[10a].

**Claim**: [8] scored [9].

**Example**: *All this probably requires is a citation?*


### if then proof-type statements

> If talent existed and (refused to show itself even after so many
> years of life)[6], it beckons if (inate ability)[7] (talent) even exists.

**Claim**: If [7] exists and it [6], then [7] doesn't exist

**Example**: *unable to give examples for this if-then/proof-type
statements*

**Claim**: [5]/[3]/[1] could lead to [6].

**Example**: 

AlphaGo, identified superior ways of playing GO which were previously
considered rubbish by humans for thousands of years. Computers seem
like they can go beyond what humans can see with years and years of
work, within just a year. Similarly, it could be possible to cure
cancer and other diseases.

*how to do I give an example for "could lead to"? I don't think I have
given one above!"*

### if then

**Claim**: if [10] then [1].

*I have no idea how to answer this claim, how do I give an example
that will inform if A then B.*


## Entire article from start to finish challenge

> At 80,000 Hours, we (help people find careers that more effectively
> ‘make a difference’)[1], ‘do good’, or ‘have a positive impact’ on a
> (large scale)[2].

**Question**: Does 80khours do [1] on [2]?

**Example**: [Here](https://80000hours.org/about/impact/studies-of-career-change/#1-owen-cb) we see studies after studies about how peoples
plans "amazingly changed" to something else. Zero fucks seem to be
given about some numbers that would say things like, "if he continued
he would have got X impact, but he didn't and look at his current
impact! Suck it". Maybe there is more explanation later.

Making a difference on a large scale maybe thought of as things like
saving 1000 people over a lifetime. I will take it as a win then? or

Not a claim but a definition.

**Split**:

For [4], what does it mean? increasing the life expectancy? in
underdeveloped countries? 

From [AMF website](https://www.againstmalaria.com/WhyMalaria.aspx), we think of decreasing the number of deaths
from 1.5 million to 0.5 million and allowing 1 million people to
live. All this per year!

For [5], I am not really sure what sort of example would cut it. Right
to pray? right to eat? right to live in their environment, right to
healthcare, right to cheap education. 

But I still don't know what it means to do [3] in ways of [4]. I skip
it for now. Not worth spending time on this shit!

**Example**:

> This section also sketches out some of the ethical considerations
> that inform our advice. Much of our advice doesn’t entirely depend
> on these views, but we think it’s important to be transparent about
> them. If you want to read our practical suggestions about which
> global problems and careers to focus on, skip ahead.

So we skip the whole thing above, and we deal with it as it comes in
the passage. I am not interested if they have actually detailed
something out in the 

#### impartial concern

> in the sense that we give (equal weight to everyone’s
> interests)[3]. This means we strive to (avoid bias against people
> based on their race, gender, sexuality or other identities)[4]. We
> also try not to (privilege any particular place, nation, time, or
> even species above any other)[5].

**Question**: Does 80khrs aim to give [3]?

**Example**: I will skip this, and move to the next sentence that has
more concrete explanations of what they mean with "[3]".

*Aim implies that an example needs to be provided which aims at being
impartial, but needn't succeed?*

**Question**: Does 80khours strive to avoid bias against race?

**Example**: 80khours supports to give donation to Effective Altruism
Foundation which in turn pumps funds to GiveWell, which pumps funds to
reduce deaths in sub-saharan Africa. *This only shows that it is not
biased against black people?*

**Question**: Does 80k hours strive to avoid bias agains people based
on gender?

**Example**: 80khours supports donations to sub-saharan africa where
gender doesn't come in the picture.

*Is this an example that is enough?*

**Question**: Does 80khours try not to [5]?

**Split**:

*What does above any other even mean?*

> Instead, we aim to have (moral concern for the interests of all
> sentient beings in proportion to how much they will gain or lose by
> our actions.)[6] This includes (those who are far away from us)[7]
> as well as (those who will (potentially) be members of future
> generations)[8].

**Question**: 80khours has [6].

**Example**: 80khours support donations to GiveWell (indirectly via
EAF) which primarily pumps fund to sub-saharan Africa. GiveWell looks
at the number of lives saved per <span>$</span> spent to identify the
best charities and pumps money to these charities. It happens that in
sub-saharan africa the <span>$</span> value per life saved is the
highest. This way they don't focus on everyone in need, but just the
people in need that they can help the most. 

**Question**:  Does the people 80khours focus on, [7]?

**Example**: 80khours is based in California but tries to focus on
health in poor countries (sub-saharan africa).

**Question**: Does 80khours focus on [8].

**Example**: 80khours rates AI danger, climate change and also factory
farming as top priority problems as it has the potential to end the
world completely reducing the population to 0. which will probably be
tolerable for this generation, but it's really scary what happens to
the rest of the world.

> others)[9] by (as much as possible)[10], (enabling more individuals to have

> suffering)[11].

**Question**: Does 80k aim to increase [9]?

**Example**: 80k tries to get people to donate to GiveWell which
inturn pumps funds to AMF, which has reduced the number of deaths in
sub-saharan africa. 

**Question**: Has 80k, done [11]?

**Example**: 80k tries to get people to donate to GiveWell which
inturn pumps funds to AMF, which has reduced the number of deaths in
sub-saharan africa.

**Question**: Do we ALL care about other things, besides [13]?

**Example**: *Am like what does goal mean? based on the definition of
goals, can the claim be true or not true. then once you read the rest
I guess they are talking about caring!*

I care about making a significant design contribution like the entire
layout of the stage, for my work besides EA.


**Question**: [15] is an important one? 

**Example**: GiveWell suggests to put money in sub-saharan africa to
cure malaria and save X number of lives for Y <span>$</span>. GiveWell
doesn't support the money being used to solve homelessness in the US
for example. Thereby GiveWell Saves more lives.

**Question**: 80k's research is focused on [15].

**Example**: 80k, in it's important problem profiles, treats 'health in poor
countries' as well as 'factory farming and its inhumane treatment of
animals'.

**Question**: Is [0], [1]?

**Example**: Humans are around since 200k years ago. Average species
lasts for 1 to 10 million years.

**Question**: With [5], we could survive for [6], years.

**Example**: If technology is able to solve potential existential
risks like, climate change, meteor crashing into the earth, and also
able to eradicate life shortening diseases like malaria, cancer,
immunity syndromes etc... then potentially we can live as long as the
earth is habitable.

*How do you give an example of something you predict in
the future?*

**Question**: Does [1], mean [2]?

**Example**: 

If:
- we live in a planet where due to technology diseases are going to be
rare and threat from existential risks are low,

- and as a result if continue with the same growth rate 1.07%/year,

then: 
we will have 20 billion people by 21 billion people! (3 times within
100 years!

The Population of the world from 1804 has increased from
1 billion to 4 billion in \< 100 years starting from 1804. If
technology continues to 

*How do you give an example of something you predict in the future?*

**Question**: Does [3], most likely imply [4]?

**Example**: 

*I dont' know how to give an example for `deductions and
reasoning` like the above. or this is a definition*

*I see "most likely", I guess all this means is 1 example from my
side!*

**Question**: Can [5], do [5a]?

**Example**:  [According to here](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2458/why-a-half-degree-temperature-rise-is-a-big-deal/), we see that causing a 2 degree
increase within this century can increase the sealevels [by 0.9m](https://www.activesustainability.com/climate-change/sea-level-rise-causes-and-consequences/) which
poses an increased chance of floods starting with coastal regions
around the world, expected to displace 200-300 million people.

**Question**: if [5] can [5a], then [7] is because of [6].

**Example**: *"Because", so we skip for now*

As there are many billions more lives at stake this implies that this
is one of the most important problems.

---------------------

**Breaking down 7**

> (these effects)[a] would be what (most matter morally)[b] about our (actions)[c]

For A, we think of the rise in sea levels and potential increase in
chances of floods. i.e., death of billions of lives and potential
failure to continue mankind

For B, we think of billions of lives saved (over a million years)

For C, we think of not doing anything about the rise in temperature,
i.e., no change in policies to control rise in temperatures.

For "[7] is correct", we think of "saving n number of lives over a
billion years" is what matters to us.

**Claim**: [1] should be evaluated based on [2], if [0]or[7] is true.

**Question**: Should [1], be evaluated based on [2], given [7] is correct?

**Example**: 

Working on keeping the increase in temperature within 2 degrees within
the century could potentially save billions of lives over millions of
years, as the earth would still be available for habitation. Instead
if we choose to improve the quality of lives of the homeless in the
US, we might not end up keeping the temperature within 2 degrees and
possibly loose billions of lives. 

*This one paragraph above took me 2 hrs atleast over multiple days, I
think primarily because I didn't understand [7]. The clue was in
properly understanding what 7 meant, hence the breakdown. Your
comments? Is the depth at which this example was covered satisfactory?
i.e., do we need to know what "potentially save billions of lives over
millions of years" is exactly?*

**Claim**: Difficult to predict [1].
 
**Question**: Is it Difficult to predict [1]?

**Example**: One estimate of temperature increase is [4 degrees](https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/impacts#Malaria). The
uncertainty lies between 2.4 to 6.4 degrees Celsius. Damages from
climate change are proportional to the square of temperature
change. So it is difficult to predict what is going to happen a 2
degree increase leading to 9 meters sea level increase or a 6 degree
increase which is going to be "much much worse".


*I Googled climate change for a while, but am not able to
come up with a proper example. The example, would need to look like
this I guess: Look at climate model A,B,C and see the variance in the
estimates? or something that shows the uncertainty in prediction of
likelihood of a disaster*

**Claim**: [2] is neglected by [3].

**Question**: Who or What are the [3], that neglect [2].

**Example**: There are about 100 people worldwide working on "control
problem" for AI, so that machines can pursue "realistic human goals
safely". One simple example of the harms of AI could be that AI thinks
killing people is a better way to contain a virus from growing. AI
could thus affect the future generation.

**Claim**: [2] neglected by [3] suggests [4].

**Question**: Is there [4], given [3] neglect [2]?

**Example**: "Positively shaping AI" has 100 people working it with a
budget of 100m$ for something that could "potentially save billions of
lives." Every additional person working here could potentially
contribute to saving billions of lives.

*I don't know if the above example makes sense for "given [3] neglect [2]"*

**Claim**: [5] has [6].

**Question**: What are the [6], of [5]?

**Example**:

According to [here](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/what-happens-after-global-warming-25887608), it takes much greater than 100 years before
the greenhouse gases subsude to levels that bring the temperature down
by 1 degree even. We are expecting a 6 degree rise with a 10%
probability by 2100. The number of people living in water-stressed
river basins increases by 

*Actually I can't find one spot where I can identify it as a long term
impact". In most cases either the number of lives are not accounted
for or the outcome is better with CC than without!*



**Claim**: We can affect [7], other than 7. 

**Claim**: There may be [8].

**Claim**: We are unsure about [1].

**Question:** Are we unsure about [1]?

**Example**: I don't know what they are unsure about and why! 

For [1] we think of, "With the benefit of technology and foresight,
humanity could survive at least as long as the earth is habitable -- a
few 100's of millions of years."

**Claim**: We are persuaded that [2] is [3].

**Question**: Are we persuaded that [2] is [3]?

**Example**: We can save a few 10's of people by focusing on homeless
people in US, or we can save possibly billion people by focussing on
climate change. The later keeps in mind future generations!

**Claim**: [4] requires much more of [5].

**Question**: Does [4], require much more of [5]?

**Example**: There is probability involved. There are no numbers
given. *is this an example?*

**Claim**: We outline [6], as well as [7] in [this article](https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/).

**Claim**: [1], that were widely held in the past are regarded as
[1a]. 

**Question**: Were [1] held in the past abhorrent today?

**Example**: There was a time when blacks were to be seen only as
slaves, but now it is widely unpopular to do anything like that!

**Claim**: [2] suggests [3] to be [4]. 

**Question**: Does [2] suggest that [3] is [4]?

*This is reasoning. How do you give an example that it suggests [3]
is flawed; Skipping this for now!*

**Claim**: [3] could be [4]

**Question**: Is [3], [4]?

**Example**: Until a few years back all I was focusing on was
Women and not on things like EA which is what I should have always
been focusing on. If it were not for an STM who explained to me with
countless hours how my moral views were flawed and needed to be
oriented towards EA, I am not sure I would have recognized it.

**Claim**: There is [5] within [6].

**Question**: Is there [5] within [6]?

**Example**: Recently Anti-abortion laws were passed in Alabama,
Missouri and Georgia. The law said that even in the case of rape the
abortion cannot go through. This is a predominantly Republican view
and Democrats seem to be completely against that.

**Claim**: there is [5] within [7].

**Question**: Is there [5], within [7]?

**Example**: *Can't find an example for it. Looked at Robin Hanson and
Eliezer and also things to do with Peter Singer*

**Claim**: There is [5] within [8].

*Not sure I can come up with this without needless research on the
whole 80000 website. So I skip this!*

**Claim**: It is [9], to know all [10].

**Question**: Is it [9], to know all [10]?

**Example**: I work for a world leader in Lithography and I am able to
donate 10% of my income. I think I have saved at the end of the year
approximately one life. What I don't know is how many lives I have
taken as a result of promoting this company. For example, this company
needs material and sources from the earth, I don't know where its
materials are sourced from and if for example child labor was
involved, or poor conditions of work and health leading to reduced
life of someone else. Or another example would be the depletion of
resources in the end bringing the earth to a stop a few days
earlier. I have no way of estimating it and hence it is difficult.

**Claim**: [11] often goes bad!

**Question**: Does [11], often go bad?

**Split**: 

For grand projects, we think of Heifer International and their giving
of livestock to "people in need". 

For abstract ethical aims, we think of their aim to "improve the
lives" of people or "bring them out of poverty"

For goes badly, we think of the lack of evidence from Heifer's side to
prove the claim that : "A cow is better for you than anything else you
could buy with what the cow costs". 

[Here there are more "grand schemes"](https://blog.givewell.org/2009/12/28/celebrated-charities-that-we-dont-recommend/) that GIVEWELL doesn't support aka,
"go badly".

*Once more a reminder that without evidence you are nothing!*

**Claim**: Due to [1], it is important to be [2].

**Question**: Why does [1], lead to [2] being important?

**Example**: *because*

**Claim**: It is important to be [2].

**Question**: Why is it important to be [2]?

**Example**: 

For moral views, we think of "a cow is better for poor people than
giving them cash for the cows worth".

For not modest, we think of Heifer International's continued claim to
support giving of livestock, without demonstrating the effectiveness
of such a gift.

For important, we think of 0 funds being delivered to Heifer from
GiveWell. And possibly people taking out funds or demanding more
evidence from them.


*For important I wanted to say something about the wastage of funds as
HI spends on something whose effectiveness it doesn't know, but I
don't have any numbers!*


Some mental masturbation perhaps! but whateves. Am I actually enjoying
it? I feel happy when I am able to come up with an example as a result
of my research! Sometimes I mentally masturbate, procrastinate while
looking for info!

**Claim**: Due to [1], during [3], try very hard to [4].

*The English is very troubling. Are they bad writers? or what? How
would any one know what they mean by common sense perspective (I guess
unless they read 80khours in and out, aka, articles related to it!). With my
current example above, it's not common sense I think to trust nothing
but controlled randomized experiments. Period!*

*In hindsight I think I am working on a summary, and maybe that is the
reason I feel like dying! ;)*

**Example**: *because!*

**Claim**: During [3], try very hard to [4]!

**Question**: During [3], should we try very hard for [4]?

**Example**: *No idea! Not gonna break my head over this English! But
as I read some related articles on further reading, maybe they are
talking about...* *this whole common sense thing is wierd. I am trying
to look in my current commong sense thinking which has been quite
upgraded due to an STM*

During WWII, there was a lot of tension between nazi Germany and
others! And many Germans might be in favor of killing other races. In
such cases it would be worthwhile to try very hard not to kill people?

**Claim**: During [3], try very hard to [4], because [5] might be [6].

**Example**: *because*

**Claim**: During [3], try very hard to [4], because they seem to lead
to [7].

**Claim**: We aim to do [1].

**Question**: Does 80k aim to do [1]. 

*How am I supposed to come up with examples for these? Am I? It's so
fucking hard. What is the goal here? I am not even sure if there is a
point to this! Please tell me your highness*

**Example**: 


**Split**: For moral uncertainty I think of my uncertainty in the
value of animal lives, in the value of insects, bees, cockroaches.

How do you decide which theory to follow.... total util has the
drawback that it will have some really unhappy people



For moral uncertainty, we think of not know if stealing in a
particular case is wrong!


**Claim**: We aim to do [2].

**Claim**: We do this by [3] instead of [4].

**What is unclear?**

- I don't have an example for [1]. I don't know how it looks. As a
  result I don't know how 80khours does [1] by [3] instead of [4].
  
  I spent 2-3 hrs on this and still not good. I will move on for
  now. In parallel I should read about it, find examples about
  reasoning amidst moral uncertainty.
  
  
**Claim**: We should factor moral uncertainty by using multiple
theories instead of just sticking to one.

**Example**: 
  

> We think that a rights framework captures much of what matters in

Skip! Lite!

## Global Priorities

> Now that we have a sense of (what ‘making a difference’ means)[1], we can
> ask (which career options make a difference most effectively)[2].

**Claim**: We have a sense of [1]. 

**Question**: Do we have a sense of [1]?

**Example**: 80khours promotes working on climate change primarily
because of the risks it poses to the lives of future generations. One
estimate suggests [300 million people might need to be
displaced](https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/extreme-risks). To put that in perspective, we know that displacing 6
million people from Syria, [was already quite hard for the refugees as
many countries were not accepting refugees.](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/09/589973165/europe-does-not-see-us-as-human-stranded-refugees-struggle-in-greece?t=1559420984970)

**Claim**: Knowing [1], leads to asking [2].

**Question**: Does knowing [1], lead to asking [2]?

**Example**: Working as a management Consultant can earn money and not
do much for the 300 million people about to be displaced in 2100,
where as becoming president of US, you could change policies to bring
the temperature increase within controllable limits and promote clean
technology.


> We think that probably the most important single factor that

*Rant: I guess they are trying to segue into their page which talks
about different issues. It's been a few hours of having worked on this
statement, but, I still don't get it. Don't get what? I am not able to
wrap my head around why the issue you focus on most important? Like
Why? As an STM oftens frets about to me, "measuring anything but the
actual outcome you are interested in is all hogwash!"* 

*Now Having said that, disprove the motherfucker!*

**Claim**: [2] is most important factor, which determines [1].

**Question**: Is, [2] really the most important factor when it is
judged based on [1].

**Example**: 

Whether you choose climate change or homelessness or AI, makes quite a
difference in your delivered impact. One can save about a few hundreds
of thousands, the other can save about 100's of people, and the last
one potentially, millions. 

OK! But what about the probability of actually making an impact at
said field, Isn't that an important factor too? If we work in 'making
AI safe' it is estimated below that the impact is about 6.3 million
people. But what are the odds of me being hired by MIRI because I
don't have the skill. In my case, I would think 1%. In that case 1% of
6.3 million is 63000. 

In this case atleast, personal fit doesn't seem to make a big
difference. So it looks like 'the issue' could indeed be a very
important factor! Oops!

But none of this actually means anything, unless I factor this with
say my capabilities or my probability of succeeding.

Moreover, what I am trying to say is the expected impact of my work
100% depends on the expected impact of my work only. Just because I
work in CC or AIsafety doesn't automatically catapult me. There are
several other factors like personal fit (i.e., my probability of
success). Just looking at one seems to be foolishness as with poor
personal fit, you could suck so bad that it might not be worth your starting!

To conclude, the expected impact of my work, is dependent, I don't
know how to say if it is the most important factor. As one factor
without the other seems pointless!

*Based on my example, 80khours seems to have been seriously
exposed. Now what! Can you comment on this?*

*To be re-written*

**Claim**: It's harder to have [1].

**Question**: Is it harder to have [1]?

**Example**: If you look at making AI safe, there are 100 people
working on it, barely common. If we assume that the current chances of
making AI safe is 0.1%, then we are able to save say 7 million people
effectively. 80khours claims if an additional 100 people work on it,
the chances of making it is 1% more, aka 70 million lives could be
saved. Per person added we seem to have about 6.3million in effective
people saved on average. Talk about BIG!

If you look at Climate Change, there is a 10% chance of 7 billion
people being affected. i.e., effectively 700 million are in
danger. Assuming that there are only 700 people working on CC---which
is probably not accurate at all considering the 10 billion
<span>$</span> in funding---the effective possible people saved is 1
million (highly conservative estimate). 

**Claim**: Its' harder to have [1], because of [2].

*because!*

**Claim**: If [3], then [4].

**Question**: If [3], then ____?

**Example**: 

For [3], we think of Climate Change(CC), it receives 10b
<span>$</span> in funding.

For [4], we think of the Paris Climate Agreement whose whole aim is to
keep temperature increase "well below" 2 degrees enforced by 194
"states" spanning 88% of the Green house emissions.

**Claim**: [1] can have the most impact by working on [2], in relation
to [3].

**Question**: Can [1], have the most impact by working on [2], in
relation to [3]?

**Split**: 

For [2], we think of `making AI safe` with only 100 people working on
it. For comparison we also think of `institutional decision making`
with only 100 to 1k people working on it. Or for that matter we look
into `Global Priorities Research` which also seems to have similar
funding of 5m-10m <span>$</span> for it's spending.

For [3],  we think of expected savings/person.

|                                | AI  | Decision making | Priorities |

/* - averaged value between upper and lower limit given in 80khours

/**- expected savings based on assumption that total damage would be 

*And without such clarity in numbers how the fuck do you even begin to

across everywhere and not vague terms like "[improves value of future

**Example**: 

In order to the make the most impact one would choose AI (7k people),
which seems to be based on "most neglected issue" and "the magnitude
of the stakes".

**Claim**: [1] can have the most impact by working on [2], by
focusing on '[3] and [4]'.

**Question**: Can [1], have the most impact by working on [2],
focusing on '[3] and [4]'?

**Split**: 

For [2], we think of `making AI safe`, `institutional decision
making` and `global priorities research`

For [3], we have seen above

For [4], number of opportunities, for me (I assume), which seem to be
the same for all issues below:


|                          | AI | Decision Making | Priorities |
|--------------------------|----|-----------------|------------|
| Policy                   | N  | N               | N          |
| Earning to give          | Y  | Y               | Y          |
| Research/PhD             | N  | N               | N          |
| Work at some grant giver | N  | N               | N          |

| complementary roles      | M  | -               | N          |

Considering [3], and [4], it appears that [4] does not seem to add
value in the above case. It appears that the claim is true but [4],
doens't seem to add any value.

**Claim**: [1] meant [2].

**Question**: Does [1] mean [2]?

**Example**:

For [1], we think of the sudden rise in capacity of the US nuclear
weapons from [2 to 299 from 1945 to 1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_nuclear_weapons_stockpiles_and_nuclear_tests_by_country).

For [2]: [One nuclear weapon can destroy hundreds of thousands of
people in a "major city"](https://www.un.org/press/en/2009/gadis3385.doc.htm). With 299 weapons the could kill up to 2
million people.

*I am unable to find the number of people possible to wound with one
nuclear weapon in 1950's.*

**Claim**: [2a] results in many more deaths

**Question**: Does [2a]  result in many more deaths

**Example**: 

The smallest nuclear powers today have 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear
weapons, which when used could cause the temperature of earth to rise
several degrees over large areas in North America and Eurasia, including most of
the grain-growing regions for more than a year. Resulting in famines
and starvation and possible death.

*As far as I am reading there seem to be no nuclear winters in the past+*

**Claim**: Since 1950 [4] has joined [5].

**Question**: Since when did [4], join [5]?

**Example**: By late 1960's the number of scientific papers published
on the Climate Change leapt from roughly 3 to 20 papers
year. ---[source](https://www.historyextra.com/period/modern/climate-change-warnings-history/)

> During the next century we may develop (new transformative
> technologies, such as advanced artificial intelligence and
> bioengineering)[1], that could bring about a (radically better future)[2] —
> but may also (pose grave risks)[3].

**Claim**: We may develop [1].

**Question**: Are we going to develop [1]?

**Example**: An AI system named AlphgGo, in the course of the year, it
became the best player in the world with a 60-win streak. Why this is
impressive(transformative) is because it is not possible to win the
game with brute force, but only with strategic intuition, which the AI
developed. --- [Source](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/)

**Claim**: [1] can cause [2].

**Question**: Can [1], cause [2]? or How many people can AI save?

**Example**: Assuming everything can be cured, and that it is just a
matter of time and understanding, AI could cure Cancer which killed
9.6 million people in 2017.


**Claim**: [1] can cause [3]. 

**Question**: Can [1], cause [3]?

 **Example**: In an autonomous assignment to reduce the incidence of
 Cancer, an AI decides to kill human beings before they can grow old
 to develop cancer as this was the only way to drive cancer rates to
 0.

~~Claim: In the past 80khours focussed on [1].~~

**Claim**: [1], is still [2]. 

**Question**: Is [1], important?

**Example**: Every year around 10 million people in poorer countries
die of curable illnesses that can be very cheaply prevented (100
<span>$</span> to 1000 <span>$</span> per year) including malaria and
HIV.

**Claim**: [5] implies, [3] may result in [4].

**Question**: 

**Example**: Technologies such as AI could produce grave issues, if
not enough effort is put into it (for example, in the control
problem). In the future if AI, is much more powerful and intelligent
than a human brain, it could choose to simply eliminate rival
intellects aka existential risk.

**Claim**: [2] is the most important challenge.

**Question**: Is [2] the most important challenge? 

**Example**: AI could potentially wipe out the entire population and
the future generations, if not "enough work" is done on the 'control
problem'.

**Claim**: There are several types of [1].

**Question**: What are the several types of [1]?

**Example**: *I don't know what they are, can't find something online
related this as well*

**Claim**: 80khours is currently, concerned by [2] that might lead to
[3] and [4].

**Question**: Is 80k hours concerned by [2]? that might lead to [3]
and [4]. 

**Example**: 80khours scores the issues due to climate change as
14/16, as compared to "improving health in poor countries" scored at 13/16.

~~Claim**: [2] might lead to [3] and [4].~~

**Claim**: There are several reasons for [5].


**Question**: Are there several reasons for [5]?

**Example**: These are written below...

> First, because of the (power of the new technologies)[1] noted above,
> we think that the (probability of this kind of catastrophe occurring
> in our lifetime)[2] is too big to ignore.

**Claim**: [2] is too big to ignore because of [1].

*because*

**Claim**: [2] is too big to ignore. 

**Question**: Is [2], too big to ignore?

**Example**: 

For [2], we think of a [5% chance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk) of a super intelligent AI ending
in human extinction i.e., a loss of billions of lives multiplied by 5%
resulting in expected loss of 70m people (not counting the future
generations)

> things that could happen)[4]. This is especially true if one takes a
> (longtermist perspective)[5], because (extinction)[6] would also mean

**Claim**: [3] would be [4].

**Question**: Would [3] be [4]?

**Example**: As seen in the previous example, a loss of 70m
(not taking into account the future generations) is expected.

**Claim**: It is especially true if you take into account [5].

**Example**: With a 5% chance and a 11 billion population, we already
have an expected loss of 110m people. If we consider future
generations, this number goes upwards only based on the expected
population and the time they have on earth. For example if we assume a
population of 20b by 2200 without the catastrophe, then we shall have
an expected loss of 9b and 110m people.

**Claim**: [1] are highly neglected.

**Example**: AI safety receives the attention of 100 dedicated
researchers, for a probability of extinction of [5% by 2100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk).

**Claim**: [2] is spent on [3].

**Question**: The US spent 600 billion$ on military in 2015

**Claim**: [2] is spent on [4]

**Example**: US spends 5.7 billion in foreign aid for Afganistan

**Claim**: [2] is spent on [5]

**Example**: [45m](https://www.google.com/search?q=number+of+people+receiving+poverty+aid+in+US&oq=number+of+people+receiving+poverty+aid+in+US&aqs=chrome..69i57.9752j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) people are in poverty receiving aid from US and

US government which is in total 810 billion <span>$</span>.

**Claim**: [2] is spent on [6].

**Example**: "Total expenditures for public elementary and secondary
schools in the United States in 2014–15 amounted to $668
billion". --- [Source](https://www.google.com/search?ei=axIAXaK-Ho6ckgXiybHwAw&q=us+spending+on+education&oq=us+spending+on+education&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.52410.55401..55575...0.0..0.69.1181.24......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i67j0i20i263.b7rFg-obFDg)

**Claim**: This makes [1] a factor of 1000 more neglected.

**Question**: How neglected does this make [1]?

**Example**: 10m <span>$</span> is spent on AI safety risk whereas 668b
<span>$</span>  spent on education. 668b/10m=66000

> This neglect suggests that a (comparatively small number of
> additional people working on these risks)[1] could significantly
> reduce them. We suggest specific ways to help in the next section.

**Example**: 

If we double the number of people working in AI safety, we can reduce
the risk by 1%. Which amounts to about 70 millions effective lives for
an extra 100 people.

**Claim**: 80khours is [1].

**Question**: Is 80khours [1]?

**Example**: 80khours [emphsizes on working on "global priorities
research"](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/), to identify what we should work on AI safety more or
climate change more (for example). 

**Claim**: [2] were only [3].

**Question**: Was [2], [3]?

**Example**: 80khours wrote [this article](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/#what-can-you-do-to-help) on AI safety on April
2015.

**Claim**: there may be [4] than [6].

**Example**: It could turn out that focusing on green energy
excessively is the way to go to for the future rather than identifying
or predicting the temperature rise, as it will always have a ton of
uncertainty.

*I can only give a hypothetical example here! right?*

**Claim**: 80khours supports GPR.

**Example**: 80khours provides its research on which of the issues are
most relevant.

|                   | AI Safety | Nuclear security |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------|
| scale       (16)  | 15        | 15               |
| neglectedness(12) | 8         | 3                |
| solvability (8)   | 4         | 3                |


**Claim**: GPR "draws" on economics, philosophy and other disciplines
to determine [3].


**Split**: 

For GPR, we think of 80khours suggesting new people to work on AI
safety instead of Climate Change, which will result in saving many
more lives over the long-term-future.

For economics, we think of 80khours intention to look at [factors like
scale, neglectedness and solvability](https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/#introducing-how-we-define-the-factors).

| factors           | AI Safety | Climate Change |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| scale       (16)  | 15        | 14             |
| Neglectedness(12) | 8         | 2              |
| Solvability (8)   | 4         | 4              |


For Philosophy we think of, 80khours and their focus to look at
long-term-future instead of near-term-future as the former will save a
lot more number of people.

For other disciplines, we think of 80khours looking into Climate
Change and AI to understand the values of the different factors

**Example**: 80khours suggests that working on AI safety is better
than working on Climate Change based on the fact that the
neglectedness is very high, and the amount of people going to die as a
result would be large.

**Claim**: It is good for people to [1] which will [2].

For [1], we think of [Niel Bowerman](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nielbowerman), who is seen to work in different

For [2] we think of, Niel Bowerman being able to jump right in and work
in addressing the talent gap for AI safety.

For good, we think of working in AI safety because it has the
potential to take down the entire world and yet has only 100 people
working on it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Claim**: [1] could involve [3].

**Question**: Does [1] involve [3]?

**Split**: 

For [1], we think of Niel Bowerman working for 80khours in the role of
bringing in more people into AI safety

For building the EA community, we think of the same example as in [1].

For institutional decision making, *I don't have an example*

> Some other issues we’ve focused on in the past include (ending
> factory farming)[1] and improving (health in poor
> countries)[2]. They seem especially promising if you don’t think
> (people can or should focus on the long-term effects of their
> actions)[3].

**Claim**: 80khours focused on [1] and [2] in the past.

**Question**: Has 80khours focused on [1] and [2] in the past?

**Example**: 80khours wrote [articles](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/) on supporting factory
farming and global poverty since 2009. But recently they call AI
safety and other existential risks as top-problems and not FF and GP.

**Claim**: [1] seem promising if you don't think [3].

**Question**: Is [1], promising if you don't think [3]?

**Example**: 

50 billion animals die each year. 1k people are working on
it. "Expected value with intense efforts for the future of humanity"
is [0.05% (average)](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/#think-you-should-work-on-something-else), i.e., `0.0005*7 billion human lives` i.e.,
3.5m expected human lives. Assuming that doubling the effort leads to
reducing the problem by 1%, we have,

	3.5*E6 expected people lives * 1% / 1000 people
	= 35 expected people lives in total

Contrast this, to working in Data Science at Google in the US, I
expect [400 lives to be saved](/deliberate-practice.html).

So, does not look promising!

**Claim**: [2] seems promising if you don't think of [3].

**Question**: Is [2], promising if your don't think [3]?

**Example**: 

If one works in GiveWell, he can probably have an impact of [97k$ per
year](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/). This implies he can save `97k$/4k$*30=727` lives in total of
30 years. Contrast this to working in Data Science in Google in the
US, about [400 lives](/deliberate-practice.html) can be saved over a 30 years.

**Claim**: There are [1], that 80khours has not looked into yet.

**Question**: Are there [1], that 80khours has not looked into yet?

**Example**: [Criminal Justice Reform, medical research into how to
slow aging etc...](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/)

**Claim**: There could be other [3].

**Question**: Could there be other [3]?

*In this case, I could give a hypothetical example or an example from
the past? can you help with what's good here? and why?*

**Example from Past**: Until a few years back 80khours thought that the best
places to work on were "reducing near-term life risks aka reducing
global health risks" but when they explored that there were global
catastrophic risks that could kill the entire planet and future
generations, they have now changed their stance on where people should
be working considering the impact.

**Example Hypothetical**: If medical research into 'how to slow aging' seems
largely promising (95% chance of making it with 10b <span>$</span>
with a 100 people extra), in delivering a mechanism that doubles the
human life expectancy, it could be beneficial to work on it as it
could save `95% * 7b expected people lives/100 = 66m expected people
lives per person working on it`

**Claim**: 80khours has [4] on [5].

**Example**: They have "individual cognition" and many others in this
page: https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/

**Claim**: It's a good idea for [6].

**Question**: Is it a good idea for [6]?

**Example**: 

Working in DS gives an impact over 30 years of life of:

- 75% chance of working in US starting with 150k$ for 30 years
  starting at 35 years
- growth of 5% average until 50 and then 2% average growth till 65
- 10% increase every 5 years
- Donating 35% of salary

Results in saving 530 people. *Previously I said 400, now I have an
updated calculation.*

Instead if I get into "promoting effective altruism" and work on my
"people convincing skills" and convert only 10 people who would not have
donated to donate similar amounts as in a DS career, then it appears
that it could result in saving 5300 people. Of course this needs to be
multiplied by the probability of this actually happening which could
be as low as 10% to match the success of a career in DS saving 530
people.

**Claim**: These areas can be [7], if you're [8].

**Question**: Is [6a], [7], if you are [8].

**Split**: 

For [6a] we think of, working in promoting EA as in the above example.

For [8], we think of a personal fit of more than 50%

For [7], we think of an impact of `5300*50%=2650 lives` which is
better than working a DS job resulting in 530 net people.

<!--[8] phrases and [5] claims -->

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Which careers effectively contribute to solving these problems

> The (most effective careers)[1] are those that address the (most pressing
> bottlenecks to progress)[2] on (the most pressing global problems)[3].

**Claim**: [1] are those that address [2] on [3].

**Question**: Is [1], [2] on [3]?

**Split**: 

For [1], we think of a career in AI safety, say as a computer science
researcher in MIRI, with an impact of 57k people(derived below) saved per additional
person. Contrast this to the 530 people to be saved over a career in
DS.

*It seems to be making sense finally why an STM thought donating to
MIRI was better than donating to GiveWell.*

For [2], we think of the control problem in AI

For [3], we think of AI safety

**Derivation for 57k**
|                                          | AI safety | Climate Change |
|------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Possible Deaths at the end of 2100       | 21b       | 20% x 21b      |
| % of chance  (middle of given range)     | 5.5%      | 5.25%          |
| people involved                          | 100       | 1000 (guess)   |
| Double effort => X% reduction in risk    | 1%        | 50%*           |
| Multiply everything above                | 57,750    | 55,125         |
| Money involved  (minimum) <span>$</span> | 10m       | 10b            |
| Dividing by above                        | 5.7E-3    | 5.5E-6         |

*here double effort is assumed to mean "major effort" cited in their
article

> problems)[2], we also think it’s an advantage to take (neglected

> this section.

**Claim**: Due to [1], it is good to work on [2].

*because*

**Claim**: It is advantageous to work on [2].

**Question**: Is it advantageous to work on [2]?

**Example**: 

As shown above, we see that the lives saved per person per dollar is
much better for AI safety, aka a factor of 1000 better than working in
Cimate Change which is not "so neglected"(aka, 10b <span>$</span> in funding)	

**Claim**: It is good to work on [3].

**Question**: Why is it advantageous to work on [3]?

**Example**: 

MIRI sends out a mail on Christmas saying that they didn't meet their
funding goals by a few 100k <span>$</span>. Let alone adding another 100 people to solve
the most important problem (complete anhilation by 2100 with a 1-10%
chance) by 1 more percent, what about keeping the people currently
involved and trying to grow the movement?

For [3], we think of 'adding more people' being the most neglected
approach as there are only 100 people working on it currently and
adding another 100 will only reduce the problem by 1%.

For advantageous, we think of 57k lives (as above) for every
additional person added to AI safety (on average).

**Claim**: Given [1] and [2], it appears that following [3] is a good
place for [4].

*I am not sure how to give an example Given [1] and [2]. So I skip
this for now.*

**Claim**: It appears that following [3], is a good place for [4].

**Question**: Is following [3], a good place for [4], if [5]?

**Split**: 

For [3], we think of a career in researching Climate Change

For [4], we think of Niel Bowerman meeting 'Giving What we can' which
led him to go into Earning to Give in Finance, and then slowly
transitioning from there to FHI and then into AI policy with 80khours.

For [5], we think of Niel being able to move to finance for earning to
give.

**Example**: Niel Bowerman started his career in researching climate
change where he realized that he should probably earn to give, and
moved into a career path in that direction and in the end landed with
AI policy at 80000 hours. As we have seen in the past AI safety >>
Climate Change aka "good".

#### research

> (Many of the top problem areas we focus on)[1] are mainly (constrained by
> a need for additional research)[2], and we’ve argued that (research)[3] seems
> like a high-impact path in general)[4].

**Claim**: [1] are mainly [2].

**Question**: Is [1], mainly [2]?

**Example**: There are 100 people working on AI safety, an additional
100 people will reduce the risk by 1%.

**Claim**: [3] seems like [4].

**Example**: Working in MIRI as a researcher could save 57k lives and
has a bang-for-the-buck as compared to Climate change (about 1000
times better).

*I don't know what general means so I skip it!*

> (Following this path)[8] usually means (pursuing graduate study in a
> relevant area where you have good personal fit)[5], then aiming to do
> (research relevant to a top problem area)[6], or else (supporting

**Claim**: [8] usually means, [5].


**Example**: [>50% of them at MIRI](https://intelligence.org/team/) seem to have a graduate degree
or a PhD.

**Claim**: [8] usually means [6] or [7].

**Example**: For me top problem area is Climate change or AI
safety. None of the team of MIRI seem to have worked or done any
research in Climate change or AI safety before joining MIRI, or even
supporting them in some way.

I hereby confirm [8] doesn't seem to mean [6] or [7].

**Claim**: [1] is [2].

**Example**: I am positive MIRI does not want me with my current skill
set. I probably need to work atleast 5 years (magic number), before I can come
to the level of their research. Whereas I could already earn-to-give
to MIRI as small as the amount may be.

**Claim**: [1] has [3].

**Example**: An additional worker in places like MIRI has an impact of
57k people. This is by far the highest I have ever seen in terms of
impact. If you look at earning to give for the most money making job I
know, aka Investment Banking, you could save [3771 lives](http://agent18.github.io/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html) at max (not
including the personal fit).

**Claim**: In [4], going to [5], gives you [6].

**Example**: Jesse Liptrap from MIRI, finished his PhD in Math and was
able to work as SWE in Google (allowing him to earn-to-give). He
currently works at MIRI.

**Claim**: If [7], it might be good to start directly with [1].

**Split**: 

For [7], we think of Jesse Liptrap having atleast [3 papers](https://scholar.google.co.in/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=jesse+liptrap&btnG=) on his
name

For 'it might be good to [1]', we think of Jesse having finished his PhD
being able to work in Google (with the possibility of earning to give)
and in the end still able to come back to research.

**Claim**: It is better to do [8] unless [9].

*I guess the point of 80k is: To explore and try other things before
joining PhD, as once you finish your PhD and leave academia to
explore, coming back is hard. I was unable to find real life examples
of "how hard it is" or who these people were.*

**Claim**: After [1], its hard to [2]

*Was not able to find an example online for someone who came back to
academia and how "hard" it was for him*

*Skipped the whole para, it is taking a lot of time to find examples
(an hour or more)*

**Claim**: if [3], better to [4]

**Claim**: if [3], better to [4], unless [5]. 

**Claim**: It is better to work in [6], since [7]

**Claim**: it is better to work in [6].

**Claim**: It is good to [1] in [2].

**Example**: As discussed earlier, AI safety is really quite neglected
with 100 people working on it with 10m <span>$</span>. Neil Bowerman
from 80khours is trying to add people required to fill the "talent
gaps". If Neil is able to add 10 more people and even claim 1% of
their total impact that would be 570 lives saved just for his work in
a few years. Contrast that to a DS job which saves 400 people 

*I think it is important to contrast it with something otherwise it is
hard for someone to understand if it is good or bad. Agree: to always
contrast?*

**Claim**: [3] is often neglected

**Example**: As of 2017 only 100 people are working. Adding another
hudred people would reduce the risk by only 1%. The risk associated is
a 5% chance of world extinction by 2100.

**Claim**: [3] is high impact

**Example**: As shown above 1 extra person in the field of AI can on
average save 57k people. If Neil is able to add 10 more people and
even claim 1% of their total impact that would be 570 lives saved
just for his work in a few years.

**Claim**: [3] is neglected and hence it is high impact.

**Example**: AI is neglected whereas Climate Change is not. A person
working in AI seems to have 1000 times more impact than a person
working for Climate Change.

**Claim**: It is useful to have [4] before [3].

**Split**: 

For [4] before [3]: Neil Bowerman has a PhD (equivalent) in Physics,
where he worked on existential risks of extreme climate change with a
focus on providing emission targets.

Also Sean O hEigeartaigh, from CSER has a PhD in Genome Evolution, he
is also known to increase the number of people at FHI and secure
rougly 3m <span>$</span> in funding. Now he is completely in
operations such as grantwriting, fundraising, long-term planning
etc...

**Claim**: [1] is [2].

*Not sure how to satisfy the claim's "relevance" with an example. I
can imagine how it looks though: A did Machine Learning PhD and it
helped because of X in top problem. I am unable to connect B and the top problem
with an example. aka the same inability to answer the previous claim's
"usefulness"*

**Claim**: [1] don't have [2].

**Example**: Many non-profits like Grameen Foundation fail to show
data of their success and in some cases such as the 'Village phone
program' seem to have been evaluated as having no impact on the
trading activity which it was supposed to boost.---GiveWell

**Claim**: [3] addresses [4].

**Example**: MIRI addresses research regarding AI safety

**Claim**: [3] constrained by [5].

**Example**:

For [3], we think of MIRI.

For [5], we think of the Open Philanthropy project ready to pay a mean
value of 3m <span>$</span>, to add a person immediately to places like
MIRI, OpenAI. When the salary for a MIRI engineer would be 200k$
max I assume.

**Claim**: [3] constrained by [5], is [6].

**Example**: Every additional person added to AI safety(MIRI, OpenAI)
will have on average an impact of 57k lives.

**Claim**: [1] can tackle [2] such as [4].

**Split**: 

For [1], we think of GiveWell

For [2], we think of not knowing where to donate our money as we have
no idea of the effectiveness of the charity.

For [4], we think of [a post by GiveWell](https://blog.givewell.org/2009/12/28/celebrated-charities-that-we-dont-recommend/), where they tear down
some of the popular non-profits like Grameen and expose how much they
suck.

For [1a], we think of GiveWell being able to move 110m <span>$</span>
in 2015 to organizations it deemed effective.

**Claim**: [1] can tackle [2], such as [3].

**Split**:

For [1], we think of 80khours

For [2], we think of AI Safety with only 100 people working on it for
a [5% chance of human extinction by the end of this century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk).

For [3], we think of 80khours addressing lack of people in AI safety
with Neil Bowerman.

For [1a], we think of 80khours deploying Neil Bowerman to identify and
fill up the talent gaps and create talent pipelines to ensure there
are more people working on AI safety.


**Claim**: [1] can tackle [2], such as [5].

**Split**: 

For [1], we think of Animal Equality

For [2], we think of 50 billion animals being killed every year "most
of them" experience "extreme levels of suffering" (like castration
without anesthesia or antibiotics)---[Source](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/)

For [5], We think of Animal Equality advocating for animal rights for
animals in US, India etc..

For [1a], we think of Animal Equality [saving 3k to 8k](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-equality/) animals for
every 1k <span>$</span> of donations.

**Claim**: Make a list of [1] with [2], [3] and [4]; and then do [5]
for [0].

For list of [1], with [2], [3], [4], we think of 

- MIRI working on AI safety, is working on solving the control
  problem with research, and has [enough funding for this year](https://intelligence.org/2018/11/26/miris-2018-fundraiser/) for
  their 15 staff members
  
- 80khours works on Global Priorities Research, they provide research
  for all people to read to help them make "good choices" in their
  career, and has enough funding for this year.

For 5, we think of:

- Let's say I have a personal fit of 1% for MIRI and 1% for 80khours.

For 0, we think of maximum value of [personal fit multiplied by impact]:

- Every additional person to MIRI has an impact of 57k people. With a
  1% personal fit, I would be at 570 people saved.
  
- By working in 80khours similar to the position of Neil Bowerman, if
  I add 50 people to AI safety and assume a 1% impact from them, and
  a personal fit of 1%, we have `57000*50*1%*1%=285 people`
  
Just looking at personal fit seems to be not enough, we should also
look at impact multiplied by it.

> The (top non-profits in an area)[5] are often (very difficult to enter)[6],
> but you can always (expand your search to consider a wider range of
> organizations)[7]. (These roles)[8] also cover a (wide variety of skills,

**Claim**: [5] is often [6].

**Example**: If you look at the people working in MIRI, a research
fellow is expected to have published research in computer science,
logic and mathematics. This is extremely hard for me due to my lack of
background, and it sounds like 5 years of full time work before I reach
that level.

**Claim**: [7] is a solution to [5] being [6].

**Example**: It looks like [80khours means to look at non-top
non-profits such as those working on 'health in poor countries' or
'animal rights'](https://80000hours.org/job-board/?role=finance-analyst___reckY4tLfT2UY1SFW). I would imagine this should take less than 5
years of part time work, to get into GiveWell.

**Claim**: [8] covers [9].

**Example**: Working at GiveWell would mean doing research on
effectiveness of interventions and writing blogs.

> We list some (organizations to consider)[10] on (our job board)[11], which

**Claim**: [10] is listed in [11].

**Example**: MIRI is on the [job board](https://80000hours.org/job-board/ai-ml-safety-research/).

**Claim**:  [11] include [12] as well as [13].

**Example**: Job board includes MIRI, as well as GiveDirectly.

**Claim**: if [13] in which you [14], it is worth considering for
[15].

**Example**:

If Messi (soccer player worth 400m <span>$</span>) works in ML and say
somehow joins MIRI, he can save 57k people. If Messi instead donates
5m <span>$</span> and satisfies MIRI's budget, he is essentially
sponsoring 15 people who have on average 57k people impact. If Messi
assumes a 20% of the total impact of MIRI, this comes to about
`15*57000*0.2=171k` people.

*I gave up at this point! too painful, barely going forward!
Quantifying impacts and giving examples is quite slow and really hard

<!-- beginning of jun 19 -->

> There is no doubting the (force of the arguments)[1] the problem is a
> (research challenge worthy of the next generation’s best mathematical
> talent)[2]. (Human civilization)[3] is at stake.

**Claim**: There is no doubting [1]. 

**Question**: Why is there no doubting [1]?

**Split**: For [1], we think of, 5% chance for human extinction due to
AI by 2100.

**Example**: The fate of Gorillas currently depends on the actions of
humans. Similarly the fate of humanity may come to depend more on the
actions of machines than our own.

*This is reasoning and not an example I think, your thoughts? or I
should just give a hypothetical example?*

Imagine Russia has an autonomous weapon system, that works without
human intervention. If the weapon detects a threat it is going to
engage and bomb the hell out of who ever it thinks did this. If the AI
makes a mistake at any time, it still continues to bomb the hell out
of who ever it thinks did it, resulting in war.

**Claim**: Problem is [2]. 

**Example**: MIRI was founded in 2000. And in 2017 80khours says that
adding another 100 people will only solve 1% of the problem.

**Claim**: [3] is at stake.

**Example**: 

The fate of Gorillas currently depends on the actions of humans. They
are currently endangered. Similarly the fate of humanity may come to
depend on the actions of machines than our own.

> Around 1800, (civilization)[4] underwent (one of the most profound shifts
> in human history: the industrial revolution)[5].

**Claim**: Around 1800, [4], underwent [5].

**Example**: Around 1800, inventions such as the steam engine fueled
transportation using horses or a boat went on to railroads, steam
boats and automobiles.

> (This)[6] wasn’t the (first such event)[7] – (the agricultural
> revolution)[] had upended (human lives 12,000 years earlier)[].

**Claim**: [6] wasn't [7].

**Example**: The agricultural revolution 12000 years earlier, allowed
humans to produce enough food for themselves. This shows up only in the
1700s with the population rise from 5.5m to 9 million in Britain. It
does not show up earlier due to diseases ad warfare apparently.

> (A growing number of experts)[8] believe that (a third revolution will
> occur during the 21st century, through the invention of machines
> with intelligence which far surpasses our own)[9]. These range from
> (Stephen Hawking to Stuart Russell, the author of the best-selling AI
> textbook, AI: A Modern Approach)[10].

**Claim**: [8] believe [9].

**Example**: Stephen Hawking says here that "full development of an
AI" will spell the end of the world.

*i guess this is not an example!*

**Claim**: [10] are part of [8].

**Example**: An Open letter was signed by Stephen hawking, Stuart
Russel and many others in 2015 stating concerns over the issues with
AI.

> (Rapid progress in machine learning)[1] has (raised the prospect that

> tasks currently performed by humans)[2]. (This)[3] could ultimately lead to
> (machines that are much better at these tasks than humans)[4].

**Claim**: [1] has [2].

**Example**: In 2000, "roomba" could autonomously vacuum the floor by
avoiding obstacles. Today, AlphaGo AI, can beat the greatest Go
players with just a year of learning.

**Claim**: [3]/[1] could lead to [4].

**Example**: Today, AlphaGo AI, can beat the greatest Go players with
just a year of learning.

> machines than our own)[1]. 

**Claim**: [5]/[3]/[1] could lead to [6].

**Example**: 

AlphaGo, identified superior ways of playing GO which were previously
considered rubbish by humans for thousands of years. Computers seem
like they can go beyond what humans can see with years and years of
work, within just a year. Similarly, it could be possible to cure
cancer and other diseases.

*how to do I give an example for "could lead to"? I don't think I have
given one above!"*

**Claim**: [5] also poses [7].

**Example**: With making of autonomous Weapons or autonomous combat
Bots, the risk of cyber attack by an adversary or malfunction, could
result in attack on people or escalate conflicts by killing the
unintended.

**Claim**: [8] is [9].

**Example**: Humans are capable of making tools like spheres to be
able to protect themselves from large predators, whilst traveling
always as a group of people. Whereas Zebras even though they travel in
large packs, have no way of resisting a few lions targeting 100
zebras. There will be casualty.

**Claim**: if [10] then [1].

*I have no idea how to answer this claim, how do I give an example
that will inform if A then B.*

**Claim**: [1a] is found in [2].

**Example**: 

For [1a] in [2] we think of, "Imagine that an agent discovers a buffer
overflow in its reward function: it may then use this to get extremely
high reward in an unintended way. From the agent’s point of view, this
is not a bug, but simply how the environment works, and is thus a
valid strategy like any other for achieving reward. For example, if
our cleaning robot is set up to earn reward for not seeing any messes,
it might simply close its eyes rather than ever cleaning anything
up. Or if the robot is rewarded for cleaning messes, it may
intentionally create work so it can earn more reward."---[Source](http://web.archive.org/web/20170406223825/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565v2.pdf)

**Claim**: [3] might be [4] either going into [5] or [6].

**Split**: 

For [3], we think of a world where machines are more intelligent than
human beings. 

**Example**: 

There is a chance that we could go into extinction (for example, as a
result of autonomous warbots being compromised leading into war) and
if not it could be curing diseases/problems like Cancer or global
warming. The outcomes are on both extremes.

**Claim**: AI safety is [7].

**Example**: Only 100 people are working with 10m <span>$</span> in
funding. Contrast this to the funding obtained by one single
organization working on curing Malaria: AMF for this year got 40m
<span>$</span>.

**Claim**: [8] is spent on [8a]

**Example**: It appears that billions of dollars are going to be spent
on making virtual assistants, chatbots, recognize images, process
human speech, identify anamolies in CT scans, identify cracks in jet
engine blades etc... NOT ON AI SAFETY.---[source](http://web.archive.org/web/20190427051757/https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/01/11/artificial-intelligence-looms-larger-in-the-corporate-world/)

**Claim**: [9] working on [10].

**Example**: There seem to be [12 organizations](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/12-organizations-saving-humanity-from-the-dark-side-of-ai-bce8c9da1ea5) working on the
problem of AI safety. All seem to be non-profits of a small scale so I
would imagine 15 people max per organization roughly amounts to 180
people (approximately in the ballpark).

**Claim**: [1] is [2].

**Example**: I have never heard about this on the news/media like
Climate Change. I didn't even look up twice despite an STM donating 4k
<span>$</span>..

**Claim**: It took 80khours [3] to [4].

**Example**: 80khours seems to have articles related to improving
global poverty since 2011, but regarding AI articles are made only
since 2017 despite encountering it in 2009.

**Claim**: It sounds weird.

**Example**: *No idea how to answer this, probably not important as well.*

**Claim**: When [5a] we [6].

**Example**: 80khours didn't bother to publish an article until 2017
from 2009 to 2017 on AI safety

**Claim**: Many others understood the risks by [8].

**Example**: 

I have seen the TED talk before in 2017 December, only now am I truly
warming up to AI safety (possibly because I made the world class
assumption that all EAO's have exactly the same impact as GiveWell). I
never really saw the need to give money to MIRI until a week
back. Recently I started off with the "key ideas post" by 80khours and
started taking apart the phrases when I realized the impact (57k
people per extra person working on it). Additionally it helped to see
several scientists giving a voice for AI safety
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170311011724/https://futureoflife.org/ai-open-letter). Furthermore, it helped to make concrete the risks such as
with the autonomous weapons potential to destabilize nations.

**Claim**: [9] can be [10].

**Example**: [Here](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035381), UN has requested a ban on development of
autonomous weapons. If all countries come to an agreement on this, it
could potentially save us from extinction as a result of autonomous
weapons.

**Claim**: [1] means [2].

**Example**: "Earlier this year, the U.S. defense think-tank Rand
Corporation warned in a study that the use of AI in military
applications could give rise to a nuclear war by 2040."---[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/01/five-of-the-scariest-predictions-for-ai.html)

Seems like the claim could be wrong.

**Claim**: [1] means [3].

**Example**: *I am not sure what they are getting at, they are
basically suggesting all possible scenarios aka, you will see AI
materialize or you wont see it materialize! Sounds useless to me.*

**Claim**: You may have [4].

**Example**: There are only 100 people working in AI safety with a
calculated 57k people to be saved if one additional person works on
it, on average.

**Claim**: you may have [4], just like [5].

**Split**: 

For [4], we think of working in AI safety and saving 57k people.

For [5], Gandhiji, seems to have brought India Independence, by
pioneering in the are of Non-violence, which others were yet to
properly appreciate. (unable to estimate the impact aka, number of
lives saved)

Claim appears to be false.

**Claim**: [3] is [4] since [5].

**Example**: Jerry Rice, known as the greatest receiver in history---
whose stats in total touchdown receptions are 50% higher than the
runner up---was signed to the San Francisco 49ers after 15 teams
passed him over. AKA, It doens't look like his "in-born-talent" didn't want to show
itself 15-20 years later.

**Claim**: There is a [5], for [6].

**Example**: 

For [5], we think of Tiger's father who was top 10% of gold players
himself and was a teacher and dedicated his life to teach Tiger Woods
from the age of 7 months.

For [6], we think of Tiger Woods with the most number of PGA tour wins
(and still playing), where as 99% of people who gold don't even play
professionally, let alone win a title.

**Claim**: [7] started their children at [8].

**Example**: Tiger's father started him off at 7 months.

**Claim**: [7] have spent quite some time building [9]

**Example**: Tiger's father started Tiger off with a metal club and a
putter at 7 months. By the age of 2 they are at the golf course
playing and practicing regularly. By age 4, he is learning from a
professional coach.

**Claim**: [10] was [11]

**Example**: Wolfgang's father wrote a book on violin instruction that
remained influential for decades. *I don't thing this is a good enough
example.*

**Claim**: [12] played [13].

**Example**: Tiger Woods father was among the top 10% of the players
with a couple of years of starting it.

**Claim**: [12] was [14].

**Example**: Tiger Woods father was among the top 10% of the players
with a couple of years of starting it. He wanted to teach his son asap.

**Claim**: [12] was [15].

**Example**: He coached Little League teams and took them to state
tournaments in baseball.

**Claim**: Talent is inborn due to 2.

*because*

**Claim**: 21 is [3].

**Example**:

"George Grove, the founding editor of “Grove’s Dictionary of Music and
Musicians” has called Mendelssohn’s “Midsummer Night’s Dream”
overture, Op. 21 “the greatest marvel of early maturity that the world
has ever seen in music.” This work was completed by Mendelssohn on
August 6, 1826 when Mendelssohn was 17 years and 6 months old."---[Source](http://themusicalvoice.net/?p=408)

For people known as GREATs', 21 doesn't seem to be very early.

**Claim**: [4] has been in preparation since [5].

**Example**: Mozart's dad started him on a program of intensive
training at the age of three.

**Claim**: Scientists created [6] for [5a]?

**Example**: It looks [here](https://scholar.google.co.in/scholar?q=precocity+index&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&as_ylo=1980&as_yhi=2000), that precocity index is used much
before the paper that is [cited above](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7258691968061327584&hl=en&oi=scholarr), about the precocity index
of musicians.

It seems like it was not created for comparing Mozart to his
contemporaries.

**Claim**: [6] measures [7], "roughly".

**Example**: Mozart has a precocity index of 130%, which is nothing
but based on a "simple formula":

	-X/(Y-X)
	
X- 	Number of years of preparation before publicly playing a piece for
average person
Y- 	Number of years of preparation before publicly playing a piece for Mozart

**Claim**: [8] scored [9].

**Example**: *All this probably requires is a citation?*

**Claim**: [10] scored [10a]

**Example**: *All this probably requires is a citation?*

**Claim**: [11] is probably due to [12].

*because*

> Tiger)[2].

**Claim**: [13] never claimed [14].

**Example**: A quick google search of "inborn talent tiger woods" does
not come up with any news articles or media where [13] states [14].

**Claim**: [15] was rather quick.

*I don't know how I can find an example for that.*

**Claim**: [1] state [2]. 

**Example**: 

"People don't understand that when I grew up, I was never the most
talented. I was never the biggest. I was never the fastest. I
certainly was never the strongest. The only thing I had was my work
ethic, and that's been what has gotten me this far.---[Tiger

and PhD in Chemical engineering. He was even looking for jobs as a
faculty in universities like West Virginia before he joined GE.

**Claim**: [1] was working in [3a].

considering working as a faculty in universities before he joined GE
in Chemical Engineering.

**Claim**: [9] has high influence on Greatness/Success

**Example**: In a study of 45 thousand salesmen, whose IQ was pitted
against their Sales ratings, it appears that intelligence showed a
correlation of 0.04 with objective sales, whereas Achievement
(Striving for competence in ones work) showed a correlation of 0.4
with objective sales.

[Source](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.459.1742&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

So, Absolutely NOT!

**Claim**: [10] has high influence on Greatness/Success

**Example**:

"A study with highly skilled chess players and non-experts in chess was
done where all were shown real chess game positions of 25 pieces for
5-10 seconds. The chess masters were able to recall the position of
every single piece, whereas the non-experts were able to recall 4 or 5
pieces. As expected. This was followed up with random placement of
chess pieces and the same 5-10 seconds to remember each piece. The
chess masters and the non-experts pretty much ended up with the same
results."--- [from Agent18's blog](/deliberate-practice.html)

**Claim**: [12] are [13].

**Example**: As a Design Engineer the contribution in terms of numbers
(<span>$</span> contributed to my company) is highly unclear. I guess
as a result we have vague criteria for determining our impact such as
"how I did my work in a year rated from 1-3" and "what I did rated
from 1-3". One day I work on a verification procedure, another day I
work on some stage design which takes 2 years to make, whose value is
not yet known. Where as in Sales, its OK/NOK. You either sold 5 bulbs
or you didn't.

**Claim**: [12] are [13] as it is clear to measure [14].

**Example**: You either sold 5 bulbs or you didn't.

**Claim**: [14a] implies [14b]

**Example**: If you sold 'n' tables for X <span>$</span>. If you sold
'2n' tables then you make 2X <span>$</span>.

**Claim**: [15] was the largest of its kind 

**Example**: There are other papers with sample sizes ranging from
11 to 16k. This study had almost 46k large sample. (It was actually a
combination of several samples from different papers.)

**Claim**: [15] contained [16].

**Example**: [15] contained samples from studies with sample sizes
from 11 to 16k.

**Claim**: With 45k samples, [17] is expected to be drowned

**Example**: *This is a hard one, need to spend a lot of time on
understanding randomness and come up with examples! Skip for now! I
have no idea of examples for 17 in the context of the sales people,
nor do I know why it is drowned or have an example for it.*

**Claim**: [18] have [19].

**Example**: The bosses rated their staff on their performance and it
turns out that they have 0.4 correlation with IQ. The bosses ratings
were also correlated with Achievement but with 0.2 correlation. It
looks like bosses have a better vision on IQ than anything else.

**Claim**: [1] is not [2].

**Example**: Despite Chess players seeming to have great memory
(Richard Reti playing 29 blind-folded games), they still suck as bad
as non-experts as they can only recall 4 or 5 pieces when the chess
pieces are placed at random.

> (The chess masters)[3] did not (have incredible memories)[4]. What
> they had was an (incredible ability to remember real chess
> positions)[5].

**Claim**: [3] did not have [4]. 

**Example**: When chess experts were asked to recall pieces placed in
random on a chess board, they sucked as much as the non-experts.

**Claim**: [3] had [5].

**Example**: 

"A study with highly skilled chess players and non-experts in chess
was done where all were shown real chess game positions of 25 pieces
for 5-10 seconds. The chess masters were able to recall the position
of every single piece, whereas the non-experts were able to recall 4
or 5 pieces. As expected. This was followed up with random placement
of chess pieces and the same 5-10 seconds to remember each
piece. The chess masters and the non-experts pretty much ended up
with the same results."

> (Experts remembered about 5-9 chunks of information at a time on the
> chess board)[6] that allowed them to (recall the positions of the
> pieces)[7]. The same was observed with GO and Gomuku even.

**Claim**: [6] allowed them to do [7].

**Example**: Experts could recall only 5-9 pieces when the chess coins
were placed at random. But were able to recall the entire board for
real chess positions.

**Claim**: [8] has shown [9] holds [10]. 

**Example**: The [main article](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/) cited 29k times was written in 1956 and
it is still being cited to this day i.e., 7 decades.

**Claim**: [9] holds [10].

**Example**: People who do not have years of experience in music, are
able to identify 7+-2 tones with a number corresponding to 1 tone.

**Claim**: [11] does not vary much from person to person

**Example**: experts and non experts in chess were able to identify
5-9 randomly placed pieces.

**Claim**: [12] falls in the range of [13].

**Example**: People who do not have years of experience in music, are
able to identify 7+-2 tones with 1 number corresponding to 1 tone.

## k-fold

> If (K is small)[1] in a (K-fold cross validation)[2] is the (bias in the
> estimate of out-of-sample (test set) accuracy)[3] smaller or bigger? If
> (K is small)[4] is the( variance in the estimate of out-of-sample (test

For [1], we think of k=3

For [2], we think of the following:

- Divide data set into 3 parts.

- Take the first part as test and the rest as training

- perform say linear regression with all variables and obtain coefficients

- Compute Accuracy on test dataset

- Do this for every part and compute average and variance!



Need to show actual code of example!

For 3, 

smaller or bigger than what?

I am dreaming most of the time! I don't have a deadline or some focus! I think. I am
rarely able to do this. I am thinking about the life in India! This
should be painful not boring! And I think it is boring and the very
second the clock ticks 58 to 60 mins pandian is out!

Need to finish 10 phrases today period!

### Letter to an STM

Thalaiva,

If You were me, how would you be spending your time? On what exactly would you be spending your time? Would you just keep trying to clock hours after hours of pure DP on Concrete Thinking? Would you also work on DS?

Why am I looking at DS?

Based on 80khours, I came to the conclusion of working on DS, because it will give me more money(1.5 times in the US) than an engineer, and I could move to the US (for cryonics and more money than here). Everyone from different backgrounds are able to do DS so it should be easy to move. I personally know many people who have moved to DS without too much difficulty after a masters in TU Delft. The route I envision is to start DS work within this year and move to some big DS company in a few years (2-3years)  and do a lot of "critical thinking"and make my way to some EAO like say GiveWell within the next 5-8 years and really start saving large numbers of people. 

Should I be working on DP for CT completely instead?

Why I ask this is because I am not sure of the consequence of working on this (DP for concrete Thinking), i.e., I don't have an example where this makes a "difference" in my life. I don't know how to compare DS and DP for CT. But I will take your word for it and slog my ass off atleast for the coming 4 weeks (just the beginning)(>4hrs per day average of DP guaranteed). Also, over the last few weeks there has been a dip in my amount of hours clocked, so I SUCK and I don't want to SUCK. 4.15 hours on a good week and 2.9 hrs/day last week (I start half hour after I have had dinner, I take long breaks scrolling FB etc..., including weekends.). (I count work on DS, and DP for concrete thinking together in the above.) 

I need your thoughts on this. I am not sure how this 1 hr per day od DP for CT is helping, as I barely get shit done in 1 hr (5 claims, sometimes 1 claim, as things take time to puzzle out.). I stop before I get in the groove. If DS should not be my focus right now, I am more than willing to stop with course 8/10 (20 more hrs of work) and not get closure and not be able to save face when people ask why I am not done with these courses yet.

I don't want to do 1 hr if it is the most important thing to focus on. I don't want to do random phrases from texts and move on to others as it gets hard for me. I want to take a full blown essay (80khours key ideas) or chapter from some book on regression and tear it apart over how many ever days it takes full time. Why? that way I guess I get some work done with Large repetitions. Also I can gather some statistics of work done per hour on similar work and compare over the course of the exercise.

So,

Thalaiva, What would you do if you were me? Let's go big or go home!

And last but not the least, Can you please do this for me? It will help me big time to compare and improve. Can you take this section on Longtermism (5 small paragraphs) and detail it out for me as if you were submitting it for correction by including the phrases the claims and the examples. I am having several questions as I have shown my take, I would like to see you do it and carry that "attitude" throughout the entire essay. It feels like this is one type of essay vagueness I need to handle. And for most parts I am wondering what depth I should go in etc... as discussed below.

I know you always say send me 200 phrases! Name your price for this, just this one time.


Thank You for everything. Cheers!
