## TODO 

### On what to do DP?

- statistics book; ask jblevins and body for books
- Also scoobies cardio

- I stopped half way in key ideas. Maybe I can work again through the
  whole article or start half way.

- super intelligence maybe?

- DP book

- DP summary

- Take something from the drafts (marriage, cryonics, availability bias)

- scooby

### Keep in mind

- Keep in mind the [7] points that need to be told
 at the end  and also the subject predicate matter.

- keep subject predicate checking definition in mind as well!
 
### Things needed

org mode calculation
timeing
and word count


### Feedback checklist

Mission #9: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
concretely analyze the key claims in the book Superintelligence by
Nick Bostrom (the book mentioned in the Elon Musk tweet above). He's a
PhD at Oxford who's been writing about AI safety along with guys like
Eliezer for nearly two decades. The book has detailed arguments and
examples about all the topics like possible paths to
"superintelligence" (whatever that means), types of
"superintelligence", the control problem, etc.

No need to write "Question: " - doesn't seem to have changed your
answers.

Don't have to go sentence by sentence; look at one key claim for each
section, usually the one in the first few paragraphs, or one for each
paragraph if you feel it's an important section. For example:

> CHAPTER 2 Paths to superintelligence
>
> Machines are currently far inferior to humans in general
> intelligence. Yet one day (we have suggested) they will be
> superintelligent. How do we get from here to there? This chapter
> explores several conceivable technological paths. We look at
> artificial intelligence, whole brain emulation, biological
> cognition, and human-machine interfaces, as well as networks and
> organizations. We evaluate their different degrees of plausibility
> as pathways to superintelligence. The existence of multiple paths
> increases the probability that the destination can be reached via at
> least one of them.

The key claim is "How do we get from here to there? Answer: Artificial
intelligence, whole brain emulation, ..."

Feedback checklist:

1. Could it be that this claim has no/any example at all? For example,
   "civilization is at stake" or "5, could lead to extremely positive
   developments"

2. Could this claim be false? Remember the "there is no doubting"
   example.

3. Does this claim say anything about "best" (need to compare against
   the entire set) or "most" (need to show it's the majority in the
   set) or "no" (need to show that nothing in the set matches)?

4. Did you stick to examples that are in the chapter itself? That way
   you don't have to search online for too long.

5. Did you use a running example for a technical phrase? There will be
   lots of new phrases in the book, like "convergent instrumental
   value" and "orthogonality thesis". Whenever you see them, you
   should recall whatever running example you've used.

6. If this is an "if-then" claim, did you either get a concrete
   example or mark it as having no example?
   
   **************************addition***********************************
   or is there an If ("if you are especially motivated by one of them"
   example) or Given (Given Short black hair, Jacques kallis will not
   fit there in that claim) in the statement? Have you used them
   appropriately in the example?
   ****************************End************************************ 


Short names: none; false; best; chapter; running; if-then.

Please refer to the checklist after every claim analysis to ensure
you're not making old mistakes. If you want to add to the checklist
based on mistakes found in past feedback, that's great.

there was a greater than 50% chance of “high-level machine
intelligence” – one that can carry out most human professions at least
as well as a typical human – being created by 2050, and a greater than
10% chance of it happening by 2024 (see figure below)".

**Claims**: [3] is [2].

**Subject**: [3].

**Predicate**: [2].

**Example**: Less than 1000<span>$</span> was the world average income
until 1800 A.D. This includes the time of agricultural revolution. In
2000 A.D it is 8000<span>$</span>. The increase started at around 1800 A.D.

**Definition Checking**: Seems to be on the MOST profound shifts in
human history.

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have 0 examples? No
2. could it be false? Yes
3. Does it have "no", "best"? and did you factor them? Yes and Yes.

**Claims**: [1] believe [2].

**Subject**: [1].

**Predicate**: believe [2].

**Example**: Looking at the number of signatories for the Future of

list is growing atleast by 100-200 people with designations ranging
from student, dishwasher to CEO of AI ethics lab. The article goes on
to inform that: "Because of the great potential of AI, it is important
to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential
pitfalls."

**Definition checking**: It looks like all the experts signed up for
is: "Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research
how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls". Whether a
third revolution can occur within the 21st century is not
discussed. Further more the article cited doesn't seem to all be
experts, but people ranging from student, dishwasher to CEO of Ethics
lab etc...

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No.
2. Could it be false? It looks to be false based on the [article cited
   by 80k](https://web.archive.org/web/20170311011724/https://futureoflife.org/ai-open-letter)
3. Does it have no, best? and did you factor them? No
4. Examples from chapter? Yes
5. Is this a running example? NA
6. If-then type (did you factor the if)? No

**Claims**: [3] believe [2].x

I think I will stop here and read Super Intelligence instead while
continuing about AI.

## Kamal Harris Debate

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democratic-debates-tonight-kamala-harris-joe-biden-confrontation-on-busing-segregationist-comments-and-race/

> (Sen. Kamala Harris)[1] directly challenged (former Vice President Joe Biden)[2]
> on (his recent comments on civil rights and segregationist lawmakers)[2a],
> delivering (an impassioned critique)[3] that became (the signature exchange
> of the second night of the first Democratic debate)[4].

**Claims**: [1] challenged [2] over [2a].

**Subject**: What [1] said.

**Predicate**: challenged [2] over 2a.

**Example of [1]**: "I agree with you when you commit yourself to the
importance of finding common ground... But it was hurtful to hear
you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this
country."

**Definition**: Doesn't look like [1] challenged [2] about what he
said in [2a]. [1] was merely stating what she thought Joe Biden did.

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No
2. could it be false? Yes
3. Does it have no, best? and did you factor them? No.
4. examples from same article? Yes.
5. Is this a running example? N/A 
6. If-then type (did you factor the if)? N/A

**Claims**: [1] delivered [3].

**Subject**: What [1], said.

**Predicate**: delivered [3].

**Example**: "I agree with you when you commit yourself to the
importance of finding common ground ... [But] it was hurtful to hear
you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this
country."

**Definition**: This seems to be impassioned critique.

<!-- Impassioned filled with great emotion -->

<!-- An Analysis or assesment of something -->

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No
2. Did you consider if it could be False? Yes
3. Does it have no, best? and did you factor them? 
4. Examples from chapter? Yes

**Example**: "I agree with you when you commit yourself to the
importance of finding common ground ... [But] it was hurtful to hear
you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this
country."

**Definition:** It seems that the example doesn't seem to match the
definition as that particular exchange between Joe Biden and Kamala
Harris was not the only one [highlighted by Trevor Noah in his
Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwWhs_6x42TyRM4Wstoq8HA/videos) about that particular democratic debate. There were others

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No

> her perspective)[3].

**Claims**: [1] didn't let [3].

**Subject**: What [1] did,

**Predicate**: didn't let [3].

**Example**: While Mariamme Williamson was Farting about Race and the
conversation was moving to Joe Biden, Harris said,"As the only black
person on this stage, I would like to speak on the issue of race..."
to the applause of the people, at which the moderators just stopped.

**Definition**: Example matches the definition. 

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No
2. Have you considered falsifying examples? Yes
3. Does it have 'no', 'best'? and did you factor them? No
4. Examples from Article? Yes

**Claims**: Conservative lawmakers who worked with Biden supported
[4].

**Subject**: What conservative law makers who worked with Biden, did.

**Predicate**: Supported [4].

**Example**: James Oliver Eastland testifies, "The Southern
institution of racial segregation or racial separation was the
correct, self-evident truth which arose from the chaos and confusion
of the Reconstruction period. Separation promotes racial harmony. It
permits each race to follow its own pursuits, and its own
civilization..."--- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Eastland)

**Definition**: It appears that Eastland was supporting [4].

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No
2. Have you considered falsifying examples? Yes
3. Does it have 'no', 'best'? and did you factor them? No.
4. Examples from Article? No
5. Is this a running example? No
6. If-then type (did you factor the if)? No

**Claims**: [1] began to press [2] about [3] who [4].

**Subject**: What [1] said.

**Predicate**: press [2] about [3] who [4].

**Example**: "I agree with you when you commit yourself to the
importance of finding common ground ... [But] it was hurtful to hear
you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this
country."

**Definition**: Looks like the example matches the definition.

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No
2. Have you considered falsifying examples? Yes
3. Does it have 'no', 'best'? and did you factor them? No
4. Examples from Article? Yes
5. Is this a running example? Yes
6. If-then type (did you factor the if)? No

**Claims**: Biden's past stance was against [6].

**Subject**: Biden's past stance.

**Predicate**: Was against [6].

**Example**: Biden said, "I have argued that the least effective way (to
desegregate public schools) is the busing remedy"---[Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/30/politics/kfile-joe-biden-cnn-interview-busing-desegregate-schools/index.html)

**Definition**: This claim is a little tricky I think. It makes it
sound as though Biden didn't want busing which actually "desegregated
public schools". I think Biden was against busing that CLAIMED to
desegregate public schools. So I think the claim is false as it
doesn't match the definition of [6].

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No
2. Have you considered falsifying examples? Yes.
3. Does it have 'no', 'best'? and did you factor them? No
4. Examples from Article? No
5. Is this a running example? Not sure.
6. If-then type (did you factor the if)? No


**Claims**: [1] began to press Biden on [5] "against [6]".

**Subject**: What [1] said.

**Predicate**: press Biden on [5]. 

**Example**: "But Vice President Biden, do you agree today that you
were wrong to oppose busing in America then?", said Kamala.

**Definition**: It appears that the claim is true.

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No
2. Have you considered falsifying examples? Yes
3. Does it have 'no', 'best'? and did you factor them? No
4. Examples from Article? Yes
5. Is this a running example? Yes
6. If-then type (did you factor the if)? No

**Example**: He went on to describe Talmadge as “one of the meanest
guys” he ever knew but said, “At least there was some civility. We got
things done.”

“I was in a caucus with James O Eastland,” Biden told guests of the
event, briefly imitating the senator’s southern drawl, according to
the press pool report. “He never called me ‘boy’, he always called me

the superior race and the Negro race an inferior race and the races
must be kept separate by law." ---[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Eastland)

**Definition**: I do not know how to procure a good example so I can
check against [2].

> (Harris)[1] also noted (Biden)[2] opposed (federal measures to ensure that local

> 1970s)[3]. She said that was personally painful for her.

**Claims**: [2] opposed [3].

**Subject**: What [2] did.

**Predicate**: opposing [3].

**Example**: "Biden voted *Yea* to ban federal courts from ordering
busing as a school segregation remedy and to prevent the justice

**Claims**: [1] cannot be [2].

**Subject**: Discussion amongst Democrats

**Predicate**: cannot be intellectual

**Claims**: Given [1], [2] challenged [3].

**Subject**: Given [1], what [2] said.

**Predicate**: challenged [3].

**Example**: "That's a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did
 not praise racists", said Biden.
 
**Definition**: It appears that [2] challenged [3]. But whether he
challenged only when given [1], is not clear (I would need to watch
the debate to see if he was being given the chance to respond or if he interjected).

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No

**Claims**: [1] is [2].

**Subject**: What Kamal said about Biden.

**Predicate**: is [2].

**Example**: Kamala said, "It was hurtful to hear you talk ("highly")
about the reputations of two United States senators who built their
reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this country."

**Definition**: 

All Biden said was “At least there was some civility. We didn’t agree
on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished". This
doens't look like Biden was praising the two US senators, characterized
as racists.

**Checklist** : 

1. Could it have no examples? No
2. Have you considered falsifying examples? Yes
3. Does it have 'no', 'best'? and did you factor them? No

6. If-then type (did you factor the if)? No

**Claims**: [3a] did not praise [3].

**Predicate**: did not praise racists

**Example**: Biden said in the past, "At least there was some
civility. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We
got it finished"

**Definition**: Example does not seem to match the definition.

**Claims**: Biden did not oppose [2].

**Subject**: What Biden did.

**Predicate**: did not oppose [2].

**Example**: "The point I was trying to make is when you're trying to
remedy the situation, what happened was the system whereby you could
impose a busing remedy in an area where you had black, white, black,
white living on the same block, it made a great deal of sense," Biden
added. "But where you ended up with disparate neighborhoods long
distances apart but were segregated and you tried to integrate the
facilities, it created a number of mechanical problems that are
significant." --- [Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/30/politics/kfile-joe-biden-cnn-interview-busing-desegregate-schools/index.html)

**Definition**: It looks like Biden is not opposed to busing in it's
entirety. He seems to be opposed to a particular type of busing. I
guess that's what he meant by saying "he is not opposed to busing in
America".

evaluated by white registrars and not just directly allowing them to
cast their vote as the Whites did.

*This is either going to take time or maybe there is no
example for this type. There are so many labels such as "preserve
civil rights" and "stepped in" whose definition I have no idea
about. But talking about Voting rights was relatively easy*

## Key ideas



## Personal notes

I don't remember how to do it.. Oh I am supposed to make those marks
right? yeah! 

I feel lost when it comes to using subject and predicate. I forgot the
aspect of testability when I was looking at "how onions make you
passionate"...

I was just thinking it is enough to check subject vs predicate and
that is it. ok so, claims have to be testable but "God wants us to eat
onions"
