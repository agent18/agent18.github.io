## Mission #5

> automatic)[2]"

You've described [2] using a lovely concrete example. However, [1] is
sorely lacking in examples. What is this "organizing information"? Or
"providing solutions"? That could be anything from "it's hot today"
all the way up to "e = mc^2". Contrast that to PG's [business plan](http://www.paulgraham.com/vwplan.html)
for his startup in 1995:

> OVERVIEW Webgen allows clients to generate web catalogs remotely.
>
> There are several other companies that can generate and serve web
> catalogs. The best known site of this type is Marketplace MCI
> (www.internetmci.com). But while these other sites use their
> generators in-house to build catalogs from materials provided by
> clients, Webgen's generator can be used interactively by anyone with
> a modem and a copy of Netscape. ...

You might want to describe what you're doing in such terms, like
"generate web catalogs remotely" or "used interactively", so that it
clear even to an outsider what you're doing.

I appreciate the fact that you followed the deliberate practice method
rigorously by making notes, setting them aside, and coming back
later. Great work!

* * * * *

Mission #5: Time to chunk it up. Right now, you are working on
sentences and paragraphs at a time. That is, you get feedback about
your output dimensions after writing the entire paragraph (or God
forbid, the entire essay). The feedback isn't immediate enough
(principle #3 from TiO). In contrast, look at how I narrowed down the
specific phrases [1] and [2] where you gave examples or not.

You need to take passages you feel you don't understand clearly
(perhaps some things you've written yourself about important yet
unclear issues in "rationality" and some outside material about tough
technical problems), mark within parentheses each important phrase
like I did with [1] and [2], check if you've given an example for it,
and if not, rewrite it with a concrete example. If you're not sure if
a phrase is important or not, err in favour of an example. 200
repetitions should be a good start. Soon, you will come to notice
immediately if you are throwing out words without any concrete
example, the way a misspelled word in an editor shows up with red
underlines.

Does it mean that PG and EY will give examples after every phrase? Not
necessarily. But they will have an example in mind as they write. I
suspect that when we say "people don't think clearly", we mean that
their words don't correspond to any concrete example (see: "critical
thinking"). And when your words don't correspond to anything concrete,
you can make them say anything. For a striking example, check out this
philosophical passage that EY tore to pieces:
https://youtu.be/D6peN9LiTWA?t=1067

What was the problem there? The words didn't correspond to any known
piece of reality. They were figments of the poet's imagination, and
yet he thought they described something real. It sounded convincing
even to me. I was like, yeah, maybe we really are fallen people
compared to those wise, brotherly ancients.

How would you and I tackle that? We would stop at the first phrase in
the first sentence: "In the age when life on Earth was full". Ok. Give
me a historical example or empirical evidence for what you mean by
"life on Earth was full". People had ACs? Cars? Long lives? Lots of
sex? (Could be true. Could also be not true. Need empirical
evidence. And if you say you can't get that evidence from millenia
ago... well, that's the whole point! Why are you using as an example
something that you have no real evidence about? End of story then and
there.)

Let's take another example closer to home. "I need to practice
critical thinking and become a master." - Anonymous, 1785 AD. Well,
Mr. Anonymous, what is this "critical thinking" you speak of? Let's
see at least one example (after you've practiced on a bunch of other
sentences).

## Translating Mission to my understanding

- Somehow it is important that we write as many examples as we can.

- why because words are pointless they don't drive home the meaning to
  you! The difference is very clear. For example as in the mission
  statement, you see how I talked about one particular aspect of DP,
  which was that the delivery always will be controlled conscious and
  non-automatic, aka, no direct consistancy. The example of that seems
  to be tiger woods stopping mid shot because a fucking bird shadow
  appeared behind him, or that someone heckled.
  
  Apparently you don't get better (like in car driving, or typing). if
  you leave the progress to automation or unconcious consistency, you
  will never grow or become better. But we are in the world of getting
  crazy ass skill (like what mother fucker?), like becoming better at
  critical thinking (still fluff), like solving problems that are
  important to the world like eradicating poverty, all this requires
  problem solving capabilities and that is precisely what we want.
  
  So the goal as an stm pointed out a few missions back is that words
  are fluff, they mean nothing unless they are associated with an
  example. What is the impact of this and in what content will be
  talked about later. For now we stick with the mission and maximize
  the points for this mission.
  
  
- What is expected ?

There was a complaint in the last essay from me, that things were
boring while doing the essay. Or that it was a bit easy. I didn't feel
burned down. My conclusion was the time allocated.

But an STM seems to think it was the lack of immediate feedback. While
doing DP, first I need to make some notes then write a my version and
then check against certain dimensions what needs to be done. This
overall is quite a long process, where the actual dp is 1/3rd of the
time I spend on the rest of the post.

- Side note

In the last essay I had come to the conclusion that I needed to get
also get back to what the hell was the whole point of this aka, what
do we want to improve? critical thinking, what do you mean by that!

## The rules of DP (how it looks)

1. It’s designed specifically to improve performance.

2. It can be repeated a lot

3. mentally painful

4. feedback

There are three types of DP... which..

Other articels, my own articles,

for reasons that might be clear to everybody, I think it makes sense
to examplyfy or work on parts of articels that are really important to
your life, like 'characteristics of DP`, `alias paradox`, `what STM
talks about when he says I was not clear with

also Life goals, what I should be focussed on and why and things like
that

also maybe some of my presentations?

Your CV?

Cover letter?

Your profile?

Goal: Every sentence cannot have fluff, the sentence should mean
something to you, it just can't be, "critical thinker with an ability
to move people working towards a common greater goal for life". I will
beat you rascal!

Maybe something from the dynamics course, would be a fun addition to
add here, especially the part of the virtual work. but maybe it is a
problem for getting written.

Or someother technical work

Critical thinking .org is rife with 0 examples about how to go about
things.


## Starting somewhere


**Mission**: You need to take passages you feel you don't understand
clearly (perhaps some things you've written yourself about important
yet unclear issues in "rationality" and some outside material about
tough technical problems), mark within parentheses each important
phrase like I did with [1] and [2], check if you've given an example
for it, and if not, rewrite it with a concrete example. If you're not
sure if a phrase is important or not, err in favour of an example. 200
repetitions should be a good start.



**Goal**: For me the goal , as an STM pointed out, to not have fuzzy
words, everything shall be associated with an clear real example. This
is it.

So we need to identify the important phrases using paranthesis and
then suggest if they have examples or not and then provide examples
where they aren't there.

This is not really the BF method, but one where I am improving the
skill of identifying and giving examples and improving my thinking in
terms of examples.

Mark important phrases withing parenthesis and check if there is an
example otherwise rewrite it.

### What is and isn't DP (38)

From [my summary on TIO about 'What is and isn't DP'](/DP-CT-examples.html):

> Sometimes I go to basketball practice and try a few shots from one
> spot. Then I try (some drills in ball handling)[1] to (improve play
> during the game)[2]. I try (multiple variations)[3] 2-3 times each
> and get bored and then play some one-on-ones with someone and feel
> happy that I have clocked 2 more hours of practice (that hopefully
> gets me to amazing levels someday)[4]; you know, ‘Practice makes
> perfect’ and the like. The author hosts a similar example from his
> life when he went golfing and (“practiced” with golf balls)[5]. He
> says with conviction that (this will do jack shit to your
> performance)[6].


**Rule #1:** [1...6] have been identified as the parts that do not
have any examples. Some things that stand out for me is the lack of
examples for "gets me to amazing levels someday"[4]. I have no idea
what it means, I am thinking of a few people but I guess it helps to
put it in words.


**Rule #2:** The rewrite is as follows:

So every Sunday I play basketball with my friends. Mostly I suck and
people make fun of it, especially when you make air balls or miss a
silly ass layup when you are so close to the basket. Whilst this is
me, my friends, almost all of them, have very good shooting percentage
and good range from where they can shoot. I would like to be atleast
as good as them [2]. In order to become better (become atleast as good
as them), I go to the court on Saturdays and "practice". (I start with
shooting from different places randomly (roughly 20 shots) and then
try 5 spin moves, and then move on to left handed layups)[3] and
continue something like this for about 2 hrs and (feel happy that I am
going to be as good as my friends in a year or two)[4]. At no point
did I consider feedback, in terms of shot percentage or if my form was
different every time, if I need to shoot higher or farther, what angle
should I release the ball in etc... The author of the book hosts a
similar example of how he "practiced" with golf balls. (So, he was
hitting a few 100 balls)[5]. That's it. He didn't make any note or
consciously give him feedback about how much power he needs to give
and what angle he needs to hit the ball, and where he needs to hit the
ball. The author says with conviction that this practice will not
improve the performance noticeably, i.e. (you will NEVER be better
than your peers)[6], ever.

**Rule #1:** Except [6] none of them seem to have an example
associated with it. Although they are explained in the coming
sections, it would still be useful to see them in one or two examples
just like in [6].

**Rule #2:** The rewrite is as follows:

Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
examining. It is activity designed (specifically to improve
performance)[1], often with a teacher’s help; (it can be repeated a
lot)[2]; (feedback on results is continuously available)[3]; (it’s
highly demanding mentally)[4], (whether the activity is purely
intellectual, such as chess or business-related activities)[5], or
(heavily physical, such as sports;)[6] and (it isn’t much fun)[7].

You want to be a better basket ball player. How do you do that? You
first need to identify spaces where you suck, example, shooting, lay
ups, ballhandling, passing, court vision, team playing etc... Lets for
now say we want to improve shooting, we need to design an activity
that will specifically improve that. We saw earlier how I had designed
an activity to improve shooting. I shot from random places, and did
less than 20 shots and moved on to something else. That is surely
designed by me but not to improve performance. The design should be
such that it actually improves your performance. There is a huge body
of knowledge about the mechanics, the form and the way to do the
practice, which is available and usually works better in the presence
of a teacher as sometimes you are not able to see your own
problems. Initially I never realised that I was shooting with all
sorts of forms. Everytime I shot it was different. This was pointed to
me by my teacher and I have been working on maintaining form.

So when you practice, you need to have feedback continuously. So for
example, when I am practicing shooting, I look at the parameter of
shooting percentage and log it every week when I practice. So I know
if I am getting better or if I suck, so I can take some additional
step to keep improving. In addition I train with a friend who gives me
critical feedback, laughs at me when I suck. So, Feedback.

It can be repeated a lot. The pathetic practice I had designed earlier
seriously missed out on this. I shot 20 times from different
places. Instead I should shot 20-100 times from the same place over
and over again.

It's highly demanding mentally. It is quite a mental load to
practice. You are physically tired and you still need to keep
grinding. Yesterday I was practicing this spin move and wanted to do
it 20 times. By the 10th time, I felt like I wanted to stop, but I
needed to keep grinding. So I had to push myself to do more. I was
practicing some shooting and I was sucking so hard, but I still needed
to keep grinding over all the negativity. I have put in so much hard
work over the last many weeks and the extent to which I sucked was
incredible. I was tired, my arms cound't do it and I forced myself to
do those 100 shots from close to the 3-point-line. This is what I
think of when something is mentally demanding.

It isn't much fun. It is nice to see that you are improving, but the
improvement is so slow. If I could I would never want to practice, I
just like playing the games. But then you suck at the game, when you
don't practice. And you need to push your self more than you are
capable of, i.e, make 20 spin moves even though you are getting
breathless at the end of 10.


You need to push yourself, you need to keep at it for many many many
weeks before you see little progress. Somedays you try so much but you
still are not good enough, you still need to keep at it with the focus
on the larger goal.

**Rule #1:** It looks like [2-10] highlighted statements need
'example' explanations.


**Rule #2:** The re-write is as follows.

During DP, one must identify certain sharlpy defined elements like
shooting or spin moves in basketball, that need improvement [2] and
work on them intently like [Kobe Bryant the legend](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/kobe-bryant-story-jay-williams-playoff-workout/2/) who quits
practicing only [after he makes 400 shots](https://www.businessinsider.nl/kobe-bryant-insane-work-ethic-2013-8/?international=true&r=US) (around 3 hrs of only
shooting)[3]. These practices should be designed in such a way that
they stretch your current abilities, like Jerry Rice's practice
regimen in the off season, where he would literally be training the
whole day so that his conditioning is improving during the
games[4]. The great performers, see a couple of issues and isolate
each one of them. Benjamin Franklin understood from his father that
his work stinks. His father pointed out a few of his flaws. One of the
issues was that he had poor vocabulary, so he designed his practice
only and just for that [5]. He found the best work, made notes on it,
a few days later he would make his own version and compare it to
original. You would work on it until you see sufficient improvement
before moving on to the next aspect. So in basketball, currently I
would be happy if I reached 60% shooting percentage every week in
practice before adding other aspects to my practice, such as shooting
when there is a defender etc...[6,7]

It is recommended by the author that the practices are done with the
guidance of a teacher. In case we think that we have outgrown the
benefits of a teacher, the author suggest to atleast give it another
thought. The benefits of having a teacher cannot be stressed
enough. But for the things we are working on it might either not be
possible or too pricy to have our own teacher. Nevertheless Ben
Franklin's teacher was the writings of Spectator, some work that is
clearly of a higher class than what you are capable of doing [8].

While learning, it is ideal to be in the zone where we are just beyond
our comfort zone which makes us stretch our abilities. I get easily
gased out when I make a run or follow a defender. And it is important
to be better than the other player to outrun him. To prep for this, it
might be a good idea to do interval training at the gym on the
treadmill or biking. The stat that I use to check the performance of
the day is average-heart-rate. I know what I AHR I can reach easily
161bpm over 20 mins. If I stick to that every day there will be no
improvement. I need to push myself to a much higher AHR. So I give
myself a goal that will be much harder to achieve 175bpm, so much so
that the last 2 mins will be hell. For sure setting a goal for AHR to
be 175 BPM is pushing it way too much. But 165 bpm already is
challenging enough and just outside my comfort zone. If I really
wanted to train to be the best of the best of the best, I should be
going for 175bpm, but it drastically tones down the motivation and it
becemes such a daunting task. [9..11]

**Rule #1:** It looks like [5] is only one has examples.


**Rule #2:** re-writing...

Following all this, one can work on his technique but it is very
important to see progress and get feedback, such as if you are able to
lift more weight than the last time you went to the gym [1]. Otherwise
one will stop getting any better and stop caring about the end goal
[2]. Feedback is extremely crucial to feel motivated[3]. For instance,
I mainly care about how well I do on the sunday games. Based on how I
suck or where all I suck, I work on them the next week saturday. But
without the Sunday Games I am nothing. The Sunday games give me the
ultimate true feedback about if I suck or not and gives me the real
motivation to get back on saturday to practice. There was a time when
for 3 weeks I didn't really play on Sunday, and I felt it was quite
hard to come to practice, I was even contemplating not going to the
gym [2,3]. Feedback is king.

Sometimes results might need interpretation [4] and trusting your own
judgment might not really be the best way to go about it [5]. Its easy
to fool yourself that you played "well" today. If you scored the last
basket, you usually feel good. For a better understanding of how well
you actually performed, you need to look at some sort of statistics
like how many points you scored per game or what was your field goal
percentage [4,5]. Is the blog post clear to a new reader? Will people
get the main idea? Is it organized well? Paul Graham for example,
appears to take this very seriously. Before he publishes a post, he
runs atleast a few loops of getting feedback from his friends followed
by correction before publishing it.

**Rule #1:**



**Rule #2:**

It is painful, it is a mental strain. It is not fun. Today as I am
making this exercise, it is hard. Generating examples of all kinds,
knowing that I might not really make the goal of 200, and pushing
myself to still make it is all the strain mentally. It cannot be fun,
when you are pushing yourself to be something much much more than you
are capable of. Grinding for about 6 solid hrs is quite hard. The
violinist's from Ericsson's experiment stated that practice was the
least fun activity in their daily life.

about Jerry Rice again!


Everyone would achieve greatness if it were easy and fun. But everyone
doesn't and it is not easy and fun. Your willingness to do it will
distinguish you all the more from the rest. Aamir Khan for a movie
makes a [ridiculous transformation in short time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aVw1gZ9Ncg). It was not easy
or fun as you can see from the video. He is constantly made to push
beyond what he is capable of. He struggles with doing it everyday, but
pushes himself anyway. His willingness, the mental struggle he had to
go through to do what he did distinguishes him all the more from the
rest just like Jerry Rice. How many Jerry Rice's and Aamir Khan's do
we know of? [4].

**Rule #2:** re-writing...


These tasks whether physical or not -such as improving physical
conditioning or playing the piano [1] -seem to drain out much of our
mental energy -as seen with Jerry Rice's conditioning or the
Ericsson's experiment of the pianists playing pieces[2,3] - as they
are all about improving an unsatisfactory performance and trying your
hardest to improve them.

It is estimated that 4-5 hrs of DP per day seems to be the upper
limit, across disciplines (be in body building or playing the
piano)[4], with sessions lasting no more than 90 minutes. The study of
violinists are for example shows that the kids that do DP slept more
not only during the night but also during the afternoons.

38 done until now...

There is way too much vagueness in this paragraph and the coming
paragraphs.


**Rule #1**: [1,2,3,4,5] are in my opinion important phrases. They are
extremely vague and also, none of them have examples. All the 5 points
seem to be talking about some sort of (thinking that is good)[] and
some sort of (thinking that is bad)[]. Giving examples about these
seem to be objective #1.

**Rule #2**: re-writing

There is nothing more practical than sound thinking. An example of
sound thinking in a practical scenario is as follows: If engaging in
drama consumes your mind, and does not allow you to focus on things,
you should stay away from drama, even if it means apologizing to a
superior when it not your fault, as your priority is to squash the
beef and move on with important things.

You are always better off if your thinking is skilled, i.e., you can
solve problems or come up with the "right answers" for questions like,
Should we marry? or Should we Freeze ourselves?

Poor thinking in turn inevitably causes problems, wastes time and
energy, engenders frustration and pain. I was moving from one house to
another, and in an attempt to save 400 euros I brought self some major
stress over the entire month. I didn't know how to equate money to
time, I still struggle with the idea, and some time end up wasting
hours and hours just so I can save a few 10s of euros. I was buying a
phone recently and spent the entire day trading off different phones,
when I could be doing a week of courses from my Data Science course,
and keep moving ahead. A phone is 250 €. In the worst case if I bought
a bad phone I could return it or buy a new one in a year. I was trying
to make the best decision and guess what the phone still sucks. Now I
want to return this phone and buy another one which is even more
pricy. #GreatThinkingNot. Lack of ability to realize what is important
and how to trade of money is one my poor thinking.

Once I was expected to inform if the Vacuum chamber was able to go to
low pressures. I did some experiments and saw that the in some cases
it went to the expected low pressures and in other cases the leak was
too high. I was expected to present this, along with why I think it
was happening, how to verify my claim and also deliver solutions for
the problem. So I looked at the observations and failed to tell a
convincing story (logical) about why we were observing certain
phenomenon. I felt quite confused while making the presentation, and
naturally it showed in the review. I want to be better at the

This paper presents a new paradigm for design of mechanical components
that are subjected to dynamic loading in their regular operation,
typically parts moving at very high speeds such as parts of IC engines
(connecting rod, piston), or Gas turbine components (turbine)
[2]. Traditionally, such design tasks are handled by artificially
raising the level of static load by introducing a factor of safety,
meant to compensate for the unknown variations in the actual
loads. For instance, lifts and buildings are designed typically with a
factor of safety of 100 over the expected static load of the people
and furniture, accounting for unknown dynamic loads due to earthquakes
or winds etc...[4] This method works nicely when the dynamic component
of the total loads are low. Additional loads coming about in case
people jump on a table can easily be managed with a factor-of-safety
of 2 [5]. The connecting rod of an IC engine is such a component where
the factor-of-safety design due the link between inertia and
mass[6]. If you have more FOS, you will have more mass leading to
larger inertial loads than what you wanted to compensate for in the
first place.

To design such components, an iterative strategy is presented, which
relies upon a kinetostatic model to assess the dynamic loads, and
incorporates the effects of the mass distribution of the resulting
designed component on the inertial loads themselves. Unlike in the FOS
design, we use a Kinetostatic model which implies that the angular
velocity of the crank in an IC engine is constant [7]. This is done to
simplify the calculation of forces (without solving differential
equations). We also use the exact mass distribution of components to
model the inertial loads better, for example, we split the connecting
rod into 2 cylinders and one frustum while modeling its mass
distribution[8].

An application of this design technique on a reported scenario (an IC
engine), leads to significant variations in the dimensions, mass of
the designed components (30% decrease), as well as the loads
experienced by them (50% decrease) [9].

The process of design of mechanical component usually starts with the
identification of the loads on the component and their variations in
the stipulated operating scenarios. For an IC engine, we look at the
torque the engine has to generate and the forces (varying with time)
on the piston, crank and connecting rod.

In many cases it is not possible to model the loads very accurately,
more so when they vary with time. With the IC engine, there are 3 main
parts, resulting in roughly 10 forces. Solving for these forces is
quite hard and computationally intensive when we have the second order
inertia terms[3]. If the loads vary over time you have to make atleast
another 360 calculations extra[4].

In such situations, it is customary to come up with a design based on
the available knowledge of load, compensating for the undetermined
variations by introducing a factor of safety. So we set the inertial
terms to 0 and this makes the computation much much faster and allows
to get closed form solutions for forces easily. With these forces we
scale them up by X and design the parts[5].

This method, though used fairly commonly, is not guaranteed to produce
the best results (i.e., parts might fail due to overloading[5]) when
dynamic loads are comparable or greater than the static loads on a
component, as in a gas turbine rotating at 8000 rpm or an IC engine
rotating at 4000 rpm[6].

In such cases, over compensation of the loads leads to heavier designs
(if you want to support larger loads, Tables become heavier and
bigger[8]), which in turn result in greater inertial loads for the
same speeds.

An alternative design methodology could be to employ a detailed
analysis of the mass distribution, strength and loading of components,
using finite element methods for example[9].

However, because of the coupled nature of these (i.e., if you increase
mass of the part the inertia increases, if the inertia increases loads
increase, if the loads increase the dimensions increase/change, which
have an effect on the mass[10]), it is a challenging task in terms of
both modeling and computational burden.

**Rule #1**: [1,2] do not have examples, but [3] does.

**Rule #2**: Re-writing...

Sometime, a dynamic loading case is decomposed into a series of static
loading cases referred to as screen shots. The crank in an IC engine
rotates 360 degrees. So for every degree you can compute the forces as
though the system was static[1,2]. So this allows for accounting for
dynamic loads by solving a simple static case repeatedly and is called
quasi-dynamic...

This paper proposes a new design paradigm that incorporates the
effects of dynamic loading on a mechanical component, such as the
loads experienced by parts of an IC engine[1]. The loads on the
component are computed using a kinetostatic analysis model, i.e., the
crank has a constant speed[2]. This is simple and analytical in
nature, i.e., we don't need to solve differential equations, just some
simultaneous equations[3]. This is also significantly more accurate
than the static model at the same time for example, the static load
calculation does not capture the cyclic loading and overestimates the
forces[4]. Using the example of the connecting rod of an IC engine, it
has been shown that there is a significant change in resulting design
when the proposed methodology is applied to an existing design
scenario reported in literature. The existing design scenario informs
the design dimensions of the crank, connecting rod and IC
engine[5]. It is expected to produce more realistic results as the
analysis and design modules in each iteration are refined further. For
instance, if the mass distribution of the parts resulting in better
estimates of the inertial load, improve, then we should haev more
realistic results[6].

Think only in terms of impact.

I think its far more important to write well (writing that generates
ideas[1]) than most people realize. Writing doesn't just communicate
ideas it generates them. I recently wrote a [blog post](/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html) on my
understanding of what I should be doing in the coming years for my
career. The purpose of it was to inform others and myself what I was
thinking and the ideas I had[2], but also you get the bonus, you
clarify your thinking and come up with new ideas. I was constantly
worry myself about how I cound't save 10k lives and I was treating the
difference between 500 and 600 lives as meh! It was with this article,
when I was writing it, that I understood why a 100 lives is nothing
short of incredible[3].

If you're bad at writing (writing that does not communicate ideas or
generate them[4]), and don't like to do it, you'll miss out on most of
the ideas writing would have generated.

>(Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can)[1], (rewrite it over and

For my summary on [Talent Is Overrated](/deliberate-practice.html), I wrote a rough version in
5 hrs[1] followed by 3 editions of the same text taking 8 hrs, 4 hrs
and then 45 mins respectively[2]. The rough version has spelling
mistakes, formatting errors, lots of text dump. I reduced the word
count drastically (30 to 50%) by the final edition [3].

I think this means, write like you talk. The following is an example.

>Traditionally, such design tasks are handled by artificially raising

>loads.

Traditionally such design tasks are handled by artificially raising
the level of the static load, i.e., factor of safety design. This is
expected to compensate for the variations in the actual load.

Ok, So do not write ridiculously wrong sentences. Speak what you want
to write inside your head and then write it---at least in the
start. Hopefully it gets better.

An exercise like [this](http://pradeep90.github.io/deliberate-practice.html), "deliberate practice for writing", shows
how to develop a nose for good and bad writing and how to fix it. In
the process you end up imitating the writers you like as you use their
work as reference.

Benjamin Franklin took the Spectator and made notes of it and after a
few days, re-wrote them in his own words. In the end he compared his
work to the original and understood what all he could do better. He
focussed on one skill at a time such as writing organization
vocabulary etc... This he did many many times to become "America's
first great man of letters". [5,6,7]

I don't work on essays or even data science if I have less than 2 hrs
to give it. Usually I finish all my work and have like 3-4 hrs left at
the end of the day, when I pick up essay writing.

I have no idea what germanic words mean [10]. I don't have an example
for [12] either.

In the last essay on [DP](/DP-CT-examples.html), I was following the Benjamin Franklin
method and trying to find out how I compared to an essay written by an
STM. I was writing some final words, when I jumped out of my way to
write about Unconscious consistency. It was nice for me to understand
that separately, but it didn't fit in the context and I put it in as a
note. This seems like a digression[11].

In the essay on my [Career-Research](/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html), I was calculating the impact
due to various careers and saw that there was a difference of
sometimes a 100 people, and I didn't pay too much care for it, but
realized while writing further that I was valuing the life of 100
people much much less than what they were worth. This was a surprising
insight[11].

**Rule #1**: [1,2] Eleizer seems to have killed it. I want to say
'Word'. [1] is not really met with an example right away, but is
explained with examples in the 3rd paragraph.  paragraph. [2] is met
with an example in the same paragraph.

**Rule #1**: This is remarkable how EY has only one main point per
paragraph and explanation and examples. [1] is met with examples in
the second paragraph where he talks about how we think more about Bill
Gates than 19% of the planet living on less than 1$ a day.

**Rule #1**: EY delivers again with the example of how the lack of
floods deems us to think that there will be no floods ever. He gives 2
more examples based on floods.

**Rule #1** [1] do not have examples.

[2,5] has examples in the previous paragraph so I re-write it here and
[3,4] already has examples in the same sentence.

**Rule #2** rewriting...

(The wise would extrapolate from a memory of small hazards to the
possibility of large hazards.) *Looking at the impact of a small flood,
they would assess the chances of a large flood*[1]. Instead, past
experience of small hazards seems to set a perceived upper bound on
risk. Building of dams and levees lead to reduced precautions[2]. A
society well-protected against minor hazards takes no action against
major risks, building on flood plains once the regular minor floods
are eliminated[3]. A society subject to regular minor hazards treats those
minor hazards as an upper bound on the size of the risks, guarding
against regular minor floods but not occasional major floods [4].

Memory is not always a good guide to probabilities in the past, let
alone in the future[5]. The whole essay is the example.

## feedback

First day - lot of yawning. While identifying paragraphs to be worked
on and identifying sentences that need example.

Just identifying was boring max, a bit painful, lot of yawning and
mighty tendencies to get in shape

I think you need to keep typing, or do work related to that. When I
found out the sentences and tried making examples (# the real hard
work, I am feeling it)

feb 9the 18 hrs: The last one hr was alright! hard, not too intense, I
didn't sweat but making exampels is a biaaaatch

Day 2:

Managed 2*1.5 hr sessions roughly. But quite daunting. thinking of
examples and explaining them is hard. Plus my goal of 200 phrases
could be very hard! I am currently averaging about 10 examples in 1.5
hrs.


In the night: I realize I am trying to eat more than I can chew. I
come back after bbal to clock another hour. I feel more serious. I am
saying to myself, this is how it should be, grinding at top speed and
not anything slower. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE PAINFUL! ONLY THEN YOU ARE
MAXING OUT. IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD. Inshallah! indha vali
puduchuruu!

38 done by day 2


Day 3:

Boring hard, plan was to do 150 today. Started at 10:30 only. Slept
for half hour after lunch!

Did about 16+9+5 in about 2.7 hrs, that is still 10 per hour.

And feeling frustrated that sometimes I cannot come up with examples!
