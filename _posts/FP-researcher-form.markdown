## Introduction

Peter suggested to Sjir that I am a "potential" for applied
researcher. He contacted me over LinkedIn. I sent my CV and a cover
letter based on aquatics. 

FP thus sent me a [form](https://web.archive.org/web/20210709213819/https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMWpZhhRhHqim-e75ywhsF0q8Tap3BagjbQgSQF3fHtg7U5A/viewform).

## These questions need detailed answers

### #1

1. What aspect of working for Founders Pledge excites you most? [200
   words max] *
   
   
Impact--the amount of dollars I could potentially influence--excites
me the most. With over 4billion pledged donations and 1600 members,
all withing a short time of 6 years, I am very much excited for the
future of FP.

I am also exited by the opportunities to recommend/convince advisors
and members where to invest.

- The opportunity to interact with members and advisors to
  inform/convince them about where they need to invest


### #2

2. What is your current personal plan for improving the world? [200
   words max] *

1. Break into EA orgs in the coming years as a Researcher with Data
   Science Earning-to-give as back up.
   
2. In the background I am always working to get better at "critical
thinking", "Rationality", statistics, writing, and research (using
Deliberate practice)

### #3

3. What do you think is currently the best organisation to donate to
   and why? [200 words max] *
   
Giving to GiveWell recommended charities in GH&P and MIRI in
Longtermism. I give 10% in total to both orgs every year.

GiveWell recommended charities, because there are 40 people working on it to
produce the "best" research. Also GiveWell charities seem to be able
to absorb a lot more money. For example AMF can receive 100m$ more
than it is projected to receive. I don't want to try to second guess
them now (when I am working on other things).

MIRI, because they seem to be to doing fundamental research in AI
which is very important. I respect Eliezer too much as a
rationalist. Following that they met 50% of their of 2019 fundraiser,
and that they would really like to grow, I think people should donate
to them.

4. Please describe a time in the last few years where you changed your
   mind about something significant, and explain why you changed your
   mind. [200 words max]
   
A few years back, my goal in life was to work less, make little
money, and be on several mini-vacations. But now, EA is the purpose of
my life, so much so that for the last few years, I have been
working 20-30 hours a week on improving myself, in addition to my
regular job.
   
A Friend of mine introduced to me to Martin Seligman's and Peter
Singer's TED talk, and EA. And most importantly he laid the
fundamental arguments about my lack of action, the people that needed
help and how I was in a great position to help others. After a series
of intense discussions, and writing my thoughts on the different
arguments for and against EA, there was no looking back.

### #5 

5. Fermi (back of the envelope) estimate: Founders Pledge has about
   1,600 members. What is the probability that Jeff Bezos will sign
   the Founders Pledge in the next five years? How did you arrive at
   this estimate, and what are your main uncertainties? [200 words
   max] *
   
**Probability that Jeff Bezos (JB) will sign FP in the next 5 years.**

Translated to: Probability that JB will pledge >5% of his Amazon
shares in the next 5 years at FP: `15% x 0.3% = 0.05%`.

The following conditional probabilities make up the above `0.05%`

1. Probability that JB will pledge >5% of his Amazon shares (>8.5bil)
   in the coming 5 years:

	5% is my lower bound considering, 
	
	He has not done anything since he became a billionaire in 1998
    until 2017 and suddenly all his philanthropic activity
    starts. This could just be a PR stunt or to create a halo effect
    on Amazon or to get people off his back about his lack of
    philanthropic activity in the order of billions of dollars.
	
	I also think he will be struggling to give away the whole 10
    billion he has pledged so far. He has so far given away only
    700million of the 10 billion in 1.5 years.
	
	50% is the  upper bound considering,
	
	He has averaged 38% growth per year, in the last 5 years and it
    doesn't look like it is slowing down. He would want to pledge
    something to atleast get people off his back.
	
	`GM{5%,50%} = 15%`	
	  
  
2. Probability that JB will pledge that at FP (which is a binding
   contract):
   
   `GM{0.1% to 1%} = 0.3%`
   
   None of the billionaires (except Dustin) seem to have taken the
   Founders pledge (this is a very shallow conclusion). The
   100-billionaires seem to want to start their own Fund and work with
   it under their rules (Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffet, Bill and
   Melinda Gates etc.). I can't imagine why Jeff Bezos would be any
   different and come to FP. He has in the past committed openly and I
   think that is the likely scenario.

6. What is the most consequential conclusion you are aware of where
   you believe Founders Pledge research is wrong, and how do you think
   weâ€™re wrong? [200 words max] *

	
	What is consequential conclusion? Needs work
	
	I believe founders pledge research is wrong and I try to guess
    what is the most consequential conclusion, why do I think we're
    wrong?
	
	
	What is the most likely consequence  of "founders pledge research
    being wrong"?
	
	What is the most likely consequence of Founders pledge res
	
	I have not done a deep dive into any of your research. Having said
    that there seems to be a lot of effort put in Climate Change by
    you. From the EA community (mainly 80k) I gather that there are
    other areas that are far more neglected.
	
	https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/
	
	Having said that I was unable to find an overview of how you
    prioritize different cause areas and how you pitch them to your
    advisors and members.
	
	The consequential conclusion I thus think is that 
	
	There is a serious lack of comparison between the different cause
    areas. Atleast I was unable to find it. For example in the long
    term fund report there are 0 citations on where AI is supposed to
    go and no article on it...


I have not done a deep dive into any of your research. Having said
that I see very little info on cause prioritization or comparison
of any kind among different causes to help members choose the cause
that gives "maximum benefit"
(https://founderspledge.com/high-impact-giving).

In addition there seems to be quite an emphasis on Climate Change
as a cause area to donate to (i.e., the existence of "Climate
Change Fund" and not a "Long-termism fund" or an "Animal Welfare
Fund" https://founderspledge.com/funds ), while it seems
80khours and the EA community think Climate Change is way less
neglected than other issues
(https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/).
	
As a consequence members could be donating to "less neglected areas" (and hence
less "cost-effective") such as Climate Change mainly due to the hype
around it.
