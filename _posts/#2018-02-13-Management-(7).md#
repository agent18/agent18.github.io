# what I could be doing 

# Introduction according to 80k hours

[80k hours](https://80000hours.org/) suggest management consulting as a good career. It says
it is not really for direct work but it is mainly for earning to
give. There is quite some earning potential somewhere in the low
millions.

When I did the survey it is one of the first things that came
about. [80k hours][80k-hours] showed management consulting as the best option
for me after which followed data science and other things.

From my [previous post][career-6], I have taken the following:

1. Earn to give in data science / Management consulting / programming

2. Working as a researcher at GiveWell, looking at data and determining which place needs funding and how effective they are.

3. Having the ability to found companies that can cause much bigger impact

4. Manage a business or start something that can make millions or is useful to a large number of people

# What is the job?


# Well if its not really for Direct work and if it is only for earning
to give, then why pursue it? 


# Can I really get money in the low millions?

# Who are the top people in direct work who have done some work after a
management consulting job?

# MBA and its possibilities
