## Summary1

### Chapter 1: The mystery

There is always an explanation that talent is an inborn thing but the
proposal lacks all evidence. It fails blatently in many places. How
are those people so high achieving? Talent? Intelligence?

Hardwork? 
### Chapter 2: Talent is overrated

Here the talk is mainly about looking into some of the greatest in all
industries like Tiger Woods and Mozart and examining closely if there
was that spark in the early age. But in all cases examined, we see
that there was interest (Waren Buffet), from an early age, lots of
exposure and practice at an early age. The time of reasonable success
is examined. and also in the case of mozart the percocity index is
much lower than current school goers as is with other industries as
well due to much better training methodologies.

But as the author concludes, talent or a gene for a particular field
might not be relavant is clear. But, what about IQ and smartness. One
cannot but think otherwise, that all these greatest of the greats,
were smart as fuck in terms of intelligence and memory. They should
have had crazy ability in Interlligence and memory right?

### Chapter 3:

>developed abilities like SF's memory—are necessary for high
>achievement. 


>The idea that it's an inborn gift for cost accounting or writing
software or trading cocoa futures doesn't seem to hold up. Harder to
believe is that it isn't even more general cognitive abilities. That's
what the research is telling us, but it's so counterintuitive that it
requires some explanation.

the nonexperts used, so-called multiplicative models in which the
values of some factors (such as track condition) altered the

once a person has been at a job for a few years, IQ predicts littel or

with what they can remember. But the view that their amazing ability

### A Better Idea

Why Jerry Rice was so spectacular. Why his workouts were not told to
anyone as people would hurt themselves.

ITs all about the great study of diff violinist groups. 3 groups to be
precise. and how the number of hard hours clocked all their life
mattered to be where they were. And a point constantly brought about
was how not fun the practice was, it was draining energy and so
required more sleep.


They use the word deliberate practice here and 

Other than physical limitations it appears that there are not really
any limits to us acehiving the peaks of success.

### Deliberate practice

Seems like one of the important chapters to re-read.

WE do random things and work on few of the 5k things and call it
practice.

Characteristics of deliberate practice are seen in this chapter.

Example of chris rock the comedian and how to be the greatest
comedian. How to design your deliberate practice only once you have
reached the heights.


How hard it is in business to get feedback and those shots to practice
often


### How deliberate practice works.


This chapter starts off by introducing the concept of what
characteristics we see in DP'ers. Things like they see more, they know
more etc... Look at chess players playing 49 games all at once and
blindfolded. How they see certain information to get more knowledge
and .

Short-term-memory is short lived and the same for everyone but
long-term-memory is developed over time with more and more
uncomfortable DP. Retreival structure etc... What we see as important
is diff from what they see as important.

>In the letters-versus-words analogy, it isn't just that novices see
letters while experts see words; the experts also know the meanings of
the words.

Something about programmers wrtiting better programs as a result of
creating better structures by understanding the patterns of
structures.

The changes that happen are much more than phisical.

>This effect is not the obvious one in which a person's muscles get
bigger as a result of weight training, for example, but rather
involves characteristics that most people might think couldn't be
changed. En- durance runners, for instance, have larger than average
hearts, an at- tribute that most of us see as one of the natural
advantages with which they were blessed. But no, research has shown
that their hearts grow after years of intensive training; when they
stop training, their hearts revert toward normal size.

With changes to the cerebral cortex for kids practicing music to further.

>It's significant that myelination is a slow process. Building up
myelin over a nerve fiber that controls, say, hitting a particular
piano key in a particular way involves sending the appropriate signal
through that fiber over and over. This process of building up myelin
by sending 103 Talent Is Overrated signals through nerve fibers, which
occurs in purely intellectual fields like business as well as in
sports and music, needs to happen millions of times in the development
of a great performer.

We usually cannot conceive a way to become like federer. They are from
another planet.

But, 
>There is in fact a path leading from the state of our own abilities to
that of the greats. The path is extremely long and demanding, and only
a few will follow it all the way to its end.

Only few will do it and you got to be that guy.


### Chao7: DP for an induvidual

I am not sure this chapter was giving useful info on how to DP in real
time.

I should read it again. For the main part it kept showing how experts
look at situations compared to beginners.

But it started with Benji Frank, and how he used to DP. It is hard, it
is more but, it is about focussing on what we want and what we need to
improve.

Knowing what you want
Practising directly
	- using chess model, sports model to evaluate what you need to do.
	- some examples for writing.
Practising in the work
Deepening the knowledge


The importance of feedback and immediate feedback, and belief that it
is going to pay off keep us motivated.

### Chap8: something about the organization

Skimmed through in 4 mins. Not for me, not now it appears. IT was like
reading the last part of chap 7 where there was all blab! framework I
think.


### Chap 9: DP for innovation

Creativity like everything seems like it can be learned. Archimedes
didn't get an aha moment without all the deep years and knowledge he
has spent. And the author attempts to debunk the idea that "too much
knowledge inhibits your thinking.

Author points to several studies of different top level performers and
summarizes that none of them contributed in less than 6 years! Almost
none irrespective of the field of creativity required.


>There is in fact a path leading from the state of our own abilities
to that of the greats. The path is extremely long and demanding, and
only a few will follow it all the way to its 

Nothing happened in an instant. It happened with knowledge that was
built on and at all times by someone who developed domain knowledge
like crazy. with enough DP years.

>From the telegraph to the airplane to the Internet, they're all
adaptations and extensions of what existed, made possible by great
insights but entirely impossible without a deep knowledge of, and
reliance on, past achievements.

It is clear that the 2 myths that the author starts with are clearly
debunked by the end.

And some stuff about organizations!


### Chapter 10 : Great performance in Youth and Age

One of the most amazing chapters that fill me with hope and excitement
about old age. 

Yes we need to start early for most things. But things like business
starting early is not really common.

Due to heavy competition and the shear amount of knowledge needed it
appears there is the Noble price effect.

The support environment, time adn resources where we are from is quite
important! body stops to make those body changes required for some
sports music etc...


But the most important part was about how we are going to loose
functionality of everything that we just don't deep practice. Even at
crazy old ages we can have our skills just like the many people who
do. 

>Why does a chess player study four or five hours a day when becoming
even one of the world's top- ranked grand masters does not necessarily
bring wealth? Why do some young businesspeople push themselves beyond
their jobs' considerable daily demands to acquire more knowledge and
skills when the payoff is uncertain and may be years away?


### Final chapter: Where does the passion come from?

Perhaps the most important chapters and book in my life!  Got caught
in some drama.! for quite a bit! need to bounce of of it! Forgive and
move on! no revenge boye! its over! Pandian out!


One of the most crucial chapters. Mostly falls under what I haev heard
from an STM and all those ted talks..

The contradiction between the TED and that hard work is hard is dealt
with here. to be in a range where your skill just meets the results!

We basically want intrinsic instead of extrinsic motivation!

There are tons of examples of people who are completely devoted to
their life.

Initial years of the young kids might be hard, also for me, but with
time the intrinsic motivation is expected to grow with your creativity
and your DP hours clocked!

There is the multiplier effect. 

In the end the author says something on the lines of how an STM exists
how the whiplash genius exists. 

Pandian out




## Summary2

The Goal of this book is to provide you countless examples and explain
to us what is the difference between normal people and extraordinary
talents.

How we might try to get there is also suggested.


### Chapter 1: Mystery

We look at Mozart, Tiger Woods, Federer and never even think in our
right minds that we can be like them or even close to them. We think
its got a lot to do with luck and where your from and your genes
etc...

What separates hard workers from the ultimate successful people?
Lot of hard work? Experience? Talent? intelligence?

### Chapter 2: Talent is overrated

> Once training begins, we would suppose that talent would certainly
> show itself; after only three piano lessons, little Ashley is
> playing pieces that other kids need six months to learn. But again,
> this does not hap- pen reliably in people who go on to achieve a
> great deal. In a study of outstanding American pianists, for
> example, you could not have pre- dicted their eventual high level of
> achievement even after they'd been training intensively for six
> years; at that point most of them still weren't standing out from
> their peers.

Talent refuses to show itself even after many many years in people
reliably who go on to acheive the greatest heights. So what is this
talent then?

**But what about Mozart and Tiger woods?**
In both cases their fathers seem to be great teachers, and the time of
peaking seemed to be after quite some time or atleast a few
decades. The things they seem to have done when they were young seems
to either be less founded or not as great as expected.

>Mozart's first work regarded today as a masterpiece, with its status
>confirmed by the number of recordings available, is his Piano Concerto
>No. 9, com- posed when he was twenty-one. That's certainly an early
>age, but we must remember that by then Wolfgang

>If the average music student needs six years of preparation before

> years, that student would have an index of zoo percent. Mozart's
> index is around 13o percent, clearly ahead of average students. But
> twentieth-century prodigies score 30o percent to 500 percent. This
> is another example of rising standards. The effects of today's
> improved training methods apparently swamp the effects of Mozart's
> genius as a performer.

If you look at tigers history, his father was a good golf player and
his parents dedicated their lives to getting him to be the best with
the best coaching and beginning at the age of 7 months, seemingly
giving a head start to his career.

If you look at Jack Welch, CEO GE

>Jack Welch, named by Fortune magazine as the twentieth century's
> manager of the century, showed no particular inclination toward
> business, even into his midtwenties.

>He finally decided to accept an offer to work in a chemical
> development operation at General Electric.  If anything in Welch's
> history to that point suggests that he would become the most
> influential business manager of his time, it's tough— in fact,
> impossible—to spot it.

The author looks at many other examples and concludes the point that
Talent, as something that we were born with that helps us become the
best of the best, seems quite unlikely to exist, pretty much because
there seems to be barely any evidence as of this moment.

Maybe it was not talent or genes for playing a particular instrument
but something like Intelligence and Memory are two important things
that the greats could have been born with right?

### Chapter 3: IQ?

DO greats possess incredible abilities in memory and Intelligence?

>A wide range of research shows that the correlations between IQ and
> achievement aren't nearly as strong as the data on broad averages
> would suggest, and in many cases there's no correlation at all.
> Consider, for example, a study of salespeople. This was a so-called
> meta-analysis, the largest of its type ever conducted, gathering
> data from several dozen previous studies looking at almost forty-six
> thousand individuals. Studying businesspeople in the real world is
> tough because you generally can't control the conditions, and the
> results are often unclear; whether a decision was good or bad may
> not be known for years. Salespeople make attractive subjects for
> researchers because at least they produce something clear to
> measure: sales. There may still be endless sources of noise in the
> results, as salespeople explain elo- quently to their bosses, but
> over time and over large numbers of subjects, most of that should
> wash out. In this analysis of analyses, the researchers found that
> if you ask salespeople's bosses to rate them, the ratings track
> intelligence moder- ately well; bosses tend to think that smarter
> salespeople are better. But when the researchers compared
> intelligence with actual sales results, they found
> nothing. Intelligence was virtually useless in predicting how well a
> salesperson would perform. Whatever it is that makes a sales ace, it
> seems to be something other than brainpower.

>IQ is a decent predictor of performance on an unfamiliar task, but
>once a person has been at a job for a few years, IQ predicts littel
>or nothing about performance.

Betting on horses example
>The researchers' conclusion: Their results suggest "that whatever it
> is that an IQ test measures, it is not the ability to engage in cognitively
> complex forms of multivariate reasoning.

Same results reproduced in Chess grand masters and even the game GO
and scrabble players below average for verbal ability.


And what about memory,

>For example, former GE chief Jack
> Welch was famous for seeming to remember everything about one of
> the world's largest and most complicated companies, the kind of guy
> who could spot an inconsistency on the twenty-sixth line of a financial
> statement during an operating review that was glazing everyone else's
> eyes.


Countless studies seem to show that it is also acquired and only for
specific tasks. i.e, when he trained to develop memory, but having
trained that he is not able to do any better in say using random
consonants!


Example of SF

> The Czech master Richard Reti once played twenty-nine blindfolded
games simultaneously.

>Miguel Najdorf, a Polish-Argentinean grand master, played forty-five
blindfolded games simultaneously in Sao Paulo in 1947;

The point is that they are normal as everyone else, if it was not for
chess. They do not seem to have this powerful inate memory ability in
other things as seen in the study below:

>It's hard to believe that any normal person could do such things. But
> consider a study in which highly skilled chess players as well as non-
> players were shown chessboards with twenty to twenty-five pieces set
> up as they were in actual games; the research subjects were shown the
> boards only briefly—five to ten seconds—and then asked to recall the
> positions of the pieces. The results were what you'd expect: The chess
> masters could typically recall the position of every piece, while the non-
> players could place only four or five pieces. Then the researchers re-
> peated the procedure, this time with pieces positioned not as in actual
> games but randomly. The nonplayers again could place only four or five
> pieces. But the masters, who had been studying chessboards for most
> of their lives, did scarcely better, placing only six or seven pieces.
> The chess masters did not have incredible memories. What they had
> was an incredible ability to remember real chess positions.

He couldn't
have done it with any other thing but only chess. Similarly even with
GO and Gomuku. SF's incredible memory didn't extend to consonants.



Major companies look for the extrodinary based on the SATs and other
things related to IQ, but as we have seen above, these are not 

They help perform better at an unfamiliar task but thats it and within
no time High IQ and low IQ players are going to be the same?

GE doesn't necessaryly look for people from Elite schools, it look at
other things for example.

**Are there any constriants to acheive greatness**

- Death
- physical limitations 
  - such as personal dimensions
  - basketball players
  - NFL players 
  - age

**So there are physical constraints**

**Clear evidence of these non-physical constraints hasn't been found**

### Chapter 4: A better idea

In this chapter the author shows us one example of a super great
athelete who is one of his kind and what separates him from everyone
else in his field. Jerry Rice was quite good but not as good as the
NFL wanted him to be. The problem was his speed.

>In the 1985 draft, fifteen teams passed him over before the San
Francisco 49ers finally signed him.

**How the hell did such a player become a fucking legend, the greatest
receiver in NFL history?**

> He played twenty seasons at a position that is no-toriously
> perilous, and he played in almost every game of every season except
> one, 1997, when he was out for fourteen weeks because of an injury
> and returned sooner than his doctors advised. For some future player
> to perform at such an extremely high standard for so many years in a
> physically brutal game is obviously not impossible, but history sug-
> gests that it is unlikely.

>veryone in the football world seems to agree that Rice was the
> greatest because he worked harder in practice and in the off-season
> than anyone else.  In team workouts he was famous for his hustle;
> while many receiv- ers will trot back to the quarterback after
> catching a pass, Rice would sprint to the end zone after each
> reception. He would typically continue practicing long after the
> rest of the team had gone home. Most remark- able were his
> six-days-a-week off-season workouts, which he conducted entirely on
> his own. Mornings were devoted to cardiovascular work, running a
> hilly five-mile trail; he would reportedly run ten forty-meter wind
> sprints up the steepest part. In the afternoons he did equally
> strenuous weight training. These workouts became legendary as the
> most demanding in the league, and other players would sometimes join
> Rice just to see what it was like. Some of them got sick before the
> day was over.



Hard work makes a difference, but everyone did hardwork, what did he
do differently?

- Just playing was not enough as it was a small percentage of the
  football work he was doing
- He designed his practice to work on his specific needs 
- > Not being the fastest receiver in the league turned out not to
matter. He became famous for the precision of his patterns.
- It wasn't fun. He worked till pure exhaustion and failure of
  muscles.
  
- he defied age limits

>Wide receivers, who run like hell on most plays and
> frequently get crushed by tacklers, aren't supposed to last twenty sea-
> sons or play until age forty-two. None but Rice has ever done so.

**The crucial finding**

3 groups of violinsts, the best who were going to be solo performers,
the next best as decided by the professors of the school and the third
division who would most likely become teachers.

After a through study it showed that why each group was so different
from each other despite being very similar, in age, current time
dedicated to music, was that

amount of practice time told that group A and group B had the same and
group C was shit.

But despite group A and B was the same why were they so different?

>he first group had accumulated 7,410 hours of lifetime practice on
> average, versus 5,301 hours for violinists in the second group and
> 3,420 hours for those in the third group


>No matter who they were, or what explanation of their
> performance was being advanced, it always took them many years to
> become excellent, and if a person achieves elite status only after many
> years of toil, assigning the principal role in that success to innate gifts
> becomes problematic, to say the least.


>Many scientists and authors produce their greatest work only after
> twenty or more years of devoted effort, which means that in year nine-
> teen they are still getting better

>They slept more. They not only slept more at night, they also took
far more afternoon naps. All that practicing seems to demand a lot of
recovery.


>The vast majority of people we work with, or play golf with, or play
> Doom with, got better for a while and then leveled off, having appar-
> ently reached the limit of their abilities; years of further work have
> not made them any better. On the other hand, we see repeatedly that
> the people who have achieved the most are the ones who have worked the
> hardest. How can both sets of observations be true?

>Their framework is not based on a simplistic "practice makes perfect"
> observation. Rather, it is based on their highly specific concept of
> "deliberate practice."


### Chapter 5: What is deliberate practice and what isn't


Going to basketball practice and trying a few shots, then trying to
improve dribbling and then trying to do some thing else a few
times. Ah the satisfaction, I have practiced and have gotten better.

>Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
> examining. It is activity designed specifically to improve performance,
> often with a teacher's help; it can be repeated a lot; feedback on results
> is continuously available; it's highly demanding mentally, whether the
> activity is purely intellectual, such as chess or business-related activi-
> ties, or heavily physical, such as sports; and it isn't much fun.

>But anyone who thinks they've outgrown the benefits of a teacher's
help should at least question that view

> Without a clear, unbiased view of the subject's perfor- mance,
choosing the best practice activity will be impossible;

>They're meant to stretch the individual beyond his or her current
abilities.

> By contrast, deliberate practice requires that one identify certain
> sharply defined elements of performance that need to be improved,
> and then work intently on them

>The great performers isolate remarkably specific aspects
> of what they do and focus on just those things until they are improved;
> then it's on to the next aspect.

You always want to be in a space which is slightly outside your
comfort zone.

>Identifying the learning zone, which is not simple, and then forcing
oneself to stay continually in it as it changes, which is even harder—
these are the first and most important characteristics of deliberate
practice

**Repeat a lot**
>Tiger Woods may face that buried lie in the sand only two or three
times in a season,

>Top performers repeat their practice activities to stultify- ing
> extent. Ted Williams, baseball's greatest hitter, would practice hit-
> ting until his hands bled. Pete Maravich, whose college basketball
> records still stand after more than thirty years, would go to the gym
> when it opened in the morning and shoot baskets until it closed at
> night.

>You can work on technique all you like, but if you can't see
the effects, two things will happen: You won't get any better, and you'll
stop caring.

>Difficulties arise when the results require in- terpretation. You may
believe you played that bar of the Brahms Violin Concerto perfectly,
but can you really trust your own judgment?

>A finding that is remarkably consistent across disciplines is that
four or five hours a day seems to be the upper limit of deliberate
practice, and this is frequently accomplished in sessions lasting no
more than an hour to ninety minutes.

>Continually seeking exactly those elements of performance that are Is
and Isn't unsatisfactory and then trying one's hardest to make them
better places enormous strains on anyone's mental abilities.

**It is painful**

>Then we identify the painful, difficult activities that will make
> us better and do those things over and over.

>It must be so. If the activities that lead to greatness were easy and
> fun, then everyone would do them and they would not distinguish the
> best from the rest. The reality that deliberate practice is hard can
> even be seen as good news. It means that most people won't do it. So
> your will- ingness to do it will distinguish you all the more

**Life at companies**

>In fact, life at most companies seems almost intended to defeat all
> the principles of deliberate practice.

>You could say that work, like deliberate practice, is often mentally
> demanding and tiring. But that's typically not because of the intense
> focus and concentration involved. Rather, it's more often a result of
> long hours cranking out what we already know how to do. And if we're
> exhausted from that, the prospect of spending additional hours on gen-
> uine deliberate practice activities seems too miserable to contemplate.
> Similarly, work is often not fun. But again, that's not because we're try-
> ing to push beyond the edge of our abilities. It's because getting any-
> thing accomplished in the real world is a grind.


**Chris rock as example**

>Rock designed all those small-club appearances for the sole purpose
> of making himself better; because he already performs at a very high
> level, he's completely qualified to design his own practice. The
> high repetition in the process is particularly striking—appearance
> after appearance, working the ma- terial "over and over."

**The story of Polgar sisters**

How a father brought up 3 of his daughters for the sole reason of
raising them as winners. He chose chess to raise them up in as it had
fairly good study material and was well studied game.

All three went to very high levels and based on their further
commitment after becoming more than 20 decided were they would land.

**Could the explanation possibly be genetic?**

Oboe genes are almost certain they don't exist. 

>But practice proponents do not dispute the possibility that genes
> could play a role in a person's willingness to put himself or
> herself through the extremely rigorous demands of becoming an
> exceptional performer.



### Chap 6: How deliberate practice works

#### More like characteristics of DP'ers.
**Perceive more**

They look ahead, they know where to look to get more information, for
example with tennis players trying to predict where the ball is
expected to go or typewriters looking at a few words ahead to change
their fingering to type more. or doctors looking at X-rays to see far
more serious issues in an xray than simpler folk.

**They understand the significance of indicators that average
performers don't even notice.
**

**They look into the future**
>For example, Shell's scenario planning process famously prepared it
> for the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s. No scenario told Shell's manag-
> ers the embargo would happen, since scenarios are thought exercises,
> not predictions. But one of the scenarios the strategy group cooked up
> envisioned an accident in Saudi Arabia that raised the price of oil, caus-
> ing Arab producers to rethink why they set prices as they did. Shell
> managers carried the analysis further and realized that Arab producers,
> angry with the United States for its support of Israel in the Six-
> Day War,
> might believe they could serve many purposes at once by launching an
> embargo or restricting supply.

#### Knowing more

>You didn't really have to know much about a field if you knew the
best ways to analyze a problem and think it through, and you needed to
know even less if your analysis and reasoning power could be juiced by
a computer

>The answer is that the human possessed something the computer didn't,
which was vast knowledge of chess—how previous masters had responded
to par- ticular positions in many different cases, and what kinds of
choices generally produced what kinds of consequences. 

>In chess, researchers have found (using a method I'll describe a
> little later) that master-level play- ers possess more chess knowledge
> than good club-level players by a huge margin, a factor of ten to one
> hundred. Just as important, top per- formers in a wide range of fields
> have better organized and consolidated their knowledge, enabling them
> to approach problems in fundamen- tally different and more useful
> ways.

#### Remembering more

>Many decades of research have
> shown that average short-term memory holds only about seven items.
> The capacity of short-term memory doesn't seem to vary much from
> person to person; virtually everyone's short-term memory falls in the
> range of five to nine items.

**Designning deliberate practice**

How did benji Franklin do it?

**Know where you want to go!**

>But in the great majority of careers, and in the advanced stages of
all of them, there is no published curriculum, no syllabus of
materials that must be studied and mastered. In deciding which skills
and abilities to work on, and how to do it, you're on your own

>The skills and abilities one can choose to develop are infinite, but
the opportunities to practice them fall into two general categories:
op- portunities to practice directly, apart from the actual use of the
skill or ability, the way a musician practices a piece before
performing it; and opportunities to practice as part of the work
itself.

**the music model**

>Think of all the ways it could be done much better. One could ana-
lyze the text of the talk and in each section determine the most
impor- tant idea to be conveyed—passion, logical inevitability, common
bonds with the audience, humor—and then work on each section
repeatedly, constantly striving to express that key idea more
effectively, with feed- back after each repetition, either from a
coach or by watching video.

basically see where you such at and improve that part alone. Whether
you need to make a presentation or whether you need to perform in
front of someone.

>Even being interviewed—by a prospective employer or by the news
media—can be practiced in this way. After all, in those situations you
probably know the key messages that you intend to convey, regardless
of the questions you're asked.


> For straightforward written work, the multipart Ben Franklin
technique would be appropriate; instead of emulating the Spectator,
you would choose a superior letter to the shareholders, advertisement,
blog entry, or other appropriate model. 

**The chess model**

>Thousands of books of such positions have been published.  The
practice routine is to study a particular position and choose the move
you would make, then compare it with the move chosen by the master; if
they're different, figure out why and which is better.

How you can apply this to business is, to 

>You're presented with a problem, and your job is to figure out a
solution. Real life being the way it is, you often won't know whether
the solution chosen by the case's protagonist was the best one
possible, or whether yours was any better. But the process of focusing
on the problem and evaluating proposed solutions is powerfully
instructive, which helps explain why the case method

skill you probably wouldn't be very good at. But in a short time you
could study a dozen cases about marketing U.S. products in Our Lives
in China. That's one step removed from actually marketing the prod-
ucts, but it puts you many steps ahead of anyone who has not studied
that specific skill intensely and repeatedly

**The sports model**
Conditioning and working on specific critical skills

>NFL linemen build their leg muscles in a way that pro- duces
explosive power; tennis players work on stamina so they can still get
to the ball three hours into a match. The other category of practice
is working on specific critical skills—batting a baseball, throwing a
football, hitting a golf ball out of the sand. A characteristic that
many of these skills share is that they must be performed differently
every time because the situations in which they're encountered are
never the same.

>In many cases this is stuff you learned in high school or college,
and it's tempting to think you couldn't possi- bly benefit from
revisiting it. But the truth is that these strengths, like physical
strengths, decay if they aren't maintained

that stretches you just beyond your current limits.

**Deepening your knowledge**

>If you set a goal of becoming
an expert on your business, you would immediately start doing all kinds
of things you don't do now. You would study the history of the business,
identify today's leading experts, read everything you could find, inter-
view people inside your organization and outside it who could provide
new perspectives, track key statistics and trends. The exact steps would
vary depending on your business, but it's quickly apparent that you
could make yourself impressively more knowledgeable about your busi-
ness than you are today, and probably do so in short order. With time,
your knowledge advantage over others would become large.

>As you add to your knowledge of your domain, keep in mind that
your objective is not just to amass information. You are building a men-
tal model—a picture of how your domain functions as a system. This
is one of the defining traits of great performers: They all possess large,
highly developed, intricate mental models of their domains.


### Chap 9 DP for innovation

There are two myths associated with creativity. A) that it happens
suddenly (to anyone) and B) too much knowledge inhibits creativity.

Both of these are sufficiently debunked by the author.

IF you look at A) sudden creativity

When studying 76 composers for their first glorious moment, or 131
painters, or 66 poets, the answer comes out to be the very similar. No
one produced anything that the world saw before 6 years and noone less
than 5 years.

>Hayes termed the long and absolutely typical preparatory period
"ten years of silence," which seemed to be required before anything
worthwhile could be produced

A good number of years is needed for sure. you can't escape those
initial years before achieving greatness.

> Professor Howard Gardner of Harvard wrote a book-length study
(Creating Minds) of seven of the greatest innova- tors of the early
twentieth century: Albert Einstein, T. S. Eliot, Sigmund Freud,
Mahatma Gandhi, Martha Graham, Pablo Picasso, and Igor Stravinsky.

>"I have been struck throughout this study by the operation of
the ten-year rule. . .. Should one begin at age four, like Picasso, one can
be a master by the teenage years; 

 The Newcomen engine wasn't very efficient, and Watt's design
was much more efficient. It was also, of course, a giant innovation that
through its role in the industrial revolution changed the course of his-
tory. But it was not some previously unimagined conception that burst
forth like a miracle. Just the opposite: It came about because Watt was
trying to improve on what already existed, the Newcomen engine, and
his long training as a maker of scientific instruments gave him the skills
and knowledge with which to do it.

Arguiing that too much knowledge blinds you seems liek there is no
eveidence to it. 

>The steam engine and cotton gin were two of the most significant
business innovations ever, and the stories of how such innovations
come about remain the same up until the present. From the telegraph to
the airplane to the Internet, they're all adaptations and extensions
of what existed, made possible by great insights but entirely
impossible without a deep knowledge of, and reliance on, past
achievements. 

>The idea of epiphany is a dreamer's paradise where
people want to believe that things are easier than they are.

This further states the necessity of domain specific knowledge to
create amazing things is very much necessary. especially if you want
to be one of the greats. This is exactly what we are looking at.


### Chap 10: Great performane in youth and Age

**The supporting environment**

Starting early certainly has its advantages. Some of the top
violinists coming from a well supported home have accumalated 10k
hours by the time they were 20 years old.

>In an organization this progression is analogous to choosing devel-
opmental assignments that continually stretch an employee's abilities.
Employees aren't children, but many of them, like children, will not
voluntarily keep seeking new work experiences that stress their weak-
est professional muscles;

> The research focused on the students' family environments,
evaluating them on two dimensions, stimulation and support. A
stimulating environment was one with lots of opportu- nities to learn
and high academic expectations. A supportive environ- ment was one
with well-defined rules and jobs, without much arguing over who had to
do what, and in which family members could rely on one another.

**Defying age**

Young pros develop even further with time

>Yo-Yo Ma was a world-famous cellist at age twenty, but he was much
better at forty. Jamie Dimon was an amazingly accomplished financial
services executive at age twenty-nine, but he was much better at
fifty, as CEO of JPMorgan Chase

>One of the best established and least surprising findings in psy-
chology is that as we age, we slow down. Remembering things, solving
unfamiliar problems—these take about twice as long in our sixties as
they did in our twenties. We move more slowly. Coordinating our arms
and legs is more difficult. We've all seen it happen, and anyone in
their thirties or beyond has experienced it. So we might reasonably
suppose that this unavoidable trend spells doom for excellent
performance. If our minds and bodies deteriorate with the march of
time, there would seem to be nothing we can do to maintain top-level
performance be- yond a certain number of years.

> Studies in a very broad range of domains—management, aircraft
piloting, music, bridge, and others—show consistently that excellent
performers suffer the same age-related declines in speed and general
cognitive abilities as everyone else—except in their field of
expertise.

This I think is the single most relevant outcome for me from this
book, that goes on to say something rather profound about how awesome
I can be at the age of 60. Barring outright physical problems I should
still be able to kill then just like...

> Psychologists measure how fast people can push a button in response
to a question on a screen or how fast they can tap their fingers or
coordinate finger movements; all these things slow down with age. But
while excellent pianists slowed down like everyone else in how fast
they could respond to a choice on a screen, which is not a skill that
makes much difference to a pianist, they didn't slow down at all when
it came to piano-related skills like finger tapping or finger
coordination. They could do those things as if they hadn't aged at
all. It's the same story in many other fields.

You will continue to suck only if you are an amateur with tons of
experience. You are not expected to suck as an expert who keeps doing
tons of DP. example: SCOOBY?

>Those expert pianists who maintained their piano skills as they aged
were compared with a sample of amateur pianists, some of whom had
forty years of experience but had long since given up anything that
could be called deliberate practice. The amateurs, unlike the experts,
suffered predictable, across-the-board age-related declines

>Wilhelm Backhaus said that in his fifties he increased his prac- tice
of etudes, which he felt he needed in order to maintain his techni-
cal skills. 

And Arthur Rubinstein played continued to perform publicly, to great
acclaim, until he was eighty-nine

>In baseball, Julio Franco played for the Atlanta Braves in the 2007
season at age forty-nine, thanks to a regimen of intense exercise and
carefully designed diet that's unlike anything that was used in
baseball decades ago. His trainer told the New York Times, "When I got
ac- quainted with him, I learned quickly that you can't associate him
with people of his age. His discipline is unlike anything I've ever
seen.

>and even some who improve, running faster at sixty than they did at
fifty. A seventy-four-year-old man in 2004 ran a marathon in 2:54:44,
which is four minutes faster than the gold medal performance in the
1896 Olympics


All this showing me that Son You will be rewarded, it was hard for
bruce wayne to do what he did every night, without any fame or
recognition, but he still could do it why? Waar ben je de Mathivanan?


>Our brains are perfectly able to add new neurons well into old age
when conditions demand it, and brain plasticity doesn't stop with
age. Give your brain the right kind of training—for example, by making
it try to do two things at once—and plasticity
will increase in the regions that normally show the greatest atrophy
in later years.

> Warren Buffett continues to run Berkshire Hathaway brilliantly in
his late sev- enties. Rupert Murdoch, at about the same age, is
aggressively expand- ing his huge media conglomerate, News
Corporation. 

>As Karl Malone, the NBA's second all-time top scorer, told the Los
An- geles Times about aging athletes, "It's not that their bodies
stop, it's just that they've decided to stop pushing it."

>Eventually, of course, everyone's performance declines. Even the
most diligent deliberate practice cannot fend off the advancing years
forever. When Arthur Rubinstein gave up performing publicly at eighty-
nine, it was because he was becoming blind and deaf. He couldn't prac-
tice his way past that. And then there's the ultimate slowing down,
which even the greatest performers must confront. Warren Buffett told
his shareholders in his 2008 letter, "I've reluctantly discarded the notion
of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death—abandoning
my hope to give new meaning to the term 'thinking outside the box."


>If it's all about the punishing demands of deliberate practice, the
continual, painful pushing beyond what's comfortable, for hours a day
and years on end, then why does anyone do it? A parent 185 Talent Is
Overrated can make a child practice, but not with the focus and
intensity needed to become great. Something else must make the child
do that.


### Chap 11: Where does the passion come from?

>ves? Why does a chess player study four or five hours a day when
becoming even one of the world's top- ranked grand masters does not
necessarily bring wealth? Why do some young businesspeople push
themselves beyond their jobs' considerable daily demands to acquire
more knowledge and skills when the payoff is uncertain and may be
years away?

One of the most important and significant questions of the decade!

>Consider what Shizuka Arakawa had been through by the time she won
the gold medal in figure skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin,
Italy

>Ara- kawa's road to the gold medal involved at least twenty thousand
derri- ere impacts on an unforgiving surfac

**Two kinds**
Intrinsic and extrinsic

>The consistent finding reported by many researchers examining many
domains is that high creative achievement and intrinsic motivation go
together. Creative people are focused on the task (How can I solve
this problem?) and not on themselves (What will solving this problem
do for me?).

>People who rank high for intrinsic motivation on various
psychological tests consistently produce work that is judged more
creative in studies. Conversely, as well

>The work of University of Chicago psychologist Mihaly Csikszent-
mihalyi suggests TED talk that high flow allows for hightened
satisfaction 

>This "high" is achieved when the challenge just matches
the person's skills;

>But the theory of deliberate practice keeps running up against a
minor real-world contradiction. In the theory, practice is "not
inherently enjoyable." Since it requires constantly trying to do
things one can't quite do, and thus failing repeatedly,

What could be so nice about running to the point of deep exhaustion or
falling 20k times on your fucking ass?

>But in the research, top-level performers, at least in sports, often
report the opposite. In studies of wrestlers, skaters, soccer play-
ers, field hockey players, and martial artists, practice activities
rated fairly high on a scale of enjoyableness.

But we have see what the Ericsson's violinists felt. They openly
stated or rated it as the most unenjoyable part. These kids were of
the age 9?

>But at a deeper level one has to sus-
pect that practice is somehow meeting an inner need for anyone who
can maintain it at an intense level for years. It seems plausible that the
role of practice in producing the highly enjoyable flow state could be
part of it.


>Studies on  that small subset
have uncovered a wide range of driving forces, practi- cally all of
which are intrinsic. They may include a need for achieve- ment, a need
for power over others, even a need to do good in the world.  But the
drivers are almost never extrinsic, which makes sense when we observe
the most eminent executives and entrepreneurs; long after they've
accumulated more money than they could ever use and more fame than
anyone could hope for, they keep working and trying to get better.

Intrinsic drive seems the most powerful for success.

But,

>When Watson and Crick were
struggling to find the structure of DNA, they worked almost nonstop
because they knew they were in a race with other research teams. Al-
exander Graham Bell worked similarly on the telephone, knowing he
was in competition with Elisha Gray, whom he beat to the patent office
by just hours. 

>. Extrinsic motivators were of many types, not all of them
controlling, and some of them seemed to enhance
creativity. Specifically, extrinsic motivators that re- inforce
intrinsic motivation could work quite effectively. Like what?
Recognition that confirms competence turned out to be effective. While
the mere expectation of being judged tended to reduce creativity, per-
sonal feedback could actually enhance creativity if it was the right
kind—"constructive, nonthreatening, and work-focused rather than per-
son-focused," in Amabile's words. That is, feedback that helped a
person do what he or she felt compelled to do was effective. Even the
prospect of direct rewards, normally suffocating to creativity, could
be helpful if they were the right kinds of rewards—those "that involve
more time, freedom, or resources to pursue exciting ideas." These
findings prompted Amabile to revise her hypothesis: Intrinsic
motivation is still best, and extrinsic motivation that's controlling
is still detrimental to creativity, but extrinsic

>the main objectives of deliberate practice, sometimes benefits from
ex- trinsic motivators, especially in the early stages. Even the elite
perform- ers studied by Bloom required plenty of extrinsic motivation
when they were starting out in their field. Their parents made them
practice, as parents have always done, though it's interesting to note
that in these cases, when push came to shove and parents had to make a
direct threat, it frequently played off the student's intrinsic
motivators. So it wasn't "If you don't do your piano practice we'll
cancel your allowance," but rather "we'll sell the piano." Not "If you
don't go to swimming practice you'll be grounded Saturday night," but
rather "we'll take you off the team." If the child truly didn't care
about the piano or swimming, the threats wouldn't have worked.


>With time, however, "the students increasingly became responsible for
their own motivation," Bloom reports. They set their own goals. Ex-
trinsic motivators still played a role; students wanted to do well in
pub- lic performances or competitions. But in part that was because
doing so confirmed that they were making progress toward their goals,
which is what they really cared about. These events also brought the
students together with other top-level performers, so each student
could figure out "what he or she must still do to reach the highest
level of attainment possible." That is, the motivation wasn't just
acclaim for performing well, but, increasingly, the inner drive to be
the best.

**Organizations**

Evaluations at most companies are exactly the opposite: telling the
hapless employee what he did wrong, not how to do better, and
specifying personal traits (attitude, personality) that must be
changed, all under the unspoken looming threat of getting, fired.

**Auto-motivation**

Sometimes apparently there are cases where kids show amazing drive to
do something, like a 10 month old baby crying for paper and pen to
draw all the time. 

>While most children have to be made to practice, these chil-
dren can scarcely be restrained from it, and their performance is far
beyond their years. What do these very powerful stories tell us?

In some cases yes there is no explanation of where they get this
motivation from and apprently in most cases these kids don't really
reach tremendous heights.

>Conversely, the people who do become top-level achievers are rarely
child prodigies. That is certainly true in business; he early lives of
the Welches, Ogilvies, and Rockefellers almost never hint at the
success to come. Looking at more scientific research, this is one of
the most nota- ble findings in Bloom's large study, which examined
performers at the highest level—people who had achieved national or
international rec- ognition before age forty. For example, all of the
twenty-four pianists studied—each a finalist in at least one major
international competition, such as the Van Cliburn or the
Levintritt—had had lessons "forced upon them," in the words of the
study, just the opposite of the kids who seemed driven to sit at the
piano as toddlers. Similarly, in no case did the parents of the future
champion swimmers foresee their child's eventual achievements. Time
and again the story is the same: Even by age eleven or twelve it would
have been difficult to predict who the fu- ture exceptional performers
would be.

>One of the pianists recalled the life-changing
experience at age fifteen of sitting just three feet away as a great pianist
performed: "I remember feeling inundated and overwhelmed with the
dynamic range, with the expressive potential, with hearing the real bite
of the sound, the real softness of the sound. . . . at that point I became
serious like I never had before. I cut out horsing around at the piano. I
cut out sightreading for two hours a day just for the pleasure of it. I
worked."


>We've already seen that in domains where it's possible to start work
at an early age, such as music and sports, most future great
performers need to be pushed at first. In domains where building the
knowledge foundation takes many years before specific domain-related
work can begin, such as busi- ness and high-level science, we commonly
see that future stars may be decidedly undriven even as young
adults. That was obviously the case with Steven Ballmer and Jeffrey
Immelt sitting in their cubicle at Procter & Gamble. Both young men
went on to business school (Ballmer to Stanford, Immelt to Harvard)
and over time developed the drive to work prodigiously hard, not just
in general, but specifically at building the particular skills that
brought them to the top of the corporate world.  Both men became
famously focused workers.

**Multiplier effect**

Some spark seems to have started, just like the kid who started taking
piano seriously, some event or just even being better at something
else, sparks more and more interest to become better at it.

> In virtually every field, beginners can't manage more than an hour
of practice per day, and sometimes much less. But by the time they
become top performers, they've built themselves up to handling four to
five hours a day. It isn't quite right to say only that the practice
caused the performance or that the perfor- mance helped support the
practice. Over time, each contributed to the other.


>What you want—really, deeply want—is fundamental because de- liberate
practice is a heavy investment. Becoming a great performer demands the
largest investment you will ever make—many years of your life devoted
utterly to your goal—and only someone who wants to reach that goal
with extraordinary power can make it. We often see the price people
pay in their rise to the top of any field; even if their marriages or
other relationships survive, their interests outside their 204 Where
Does the Passion Come From?  field typically cannot. Howard Gardner,
after studying his seven excep- tional achievers, noted that "usually,
as a means of being able to con- tinue work, the creator sacrificed
normal relationships in the personal sphere." Such people are
"committed obsessively to their work. Social life or hobbies are
almost immaterial." That may sound like admirable self-sacrifice and
direction of purpose, but it often goes much further, and it can be
ugly.

>As Gardner notes, "the self-confidence merges with egotism,
egocentrism, and narcissism: each of the creators seems highly
self-absorbed, not only wholly involved in his or her own projects,
but likely to pursue them at the cost of other individuals." The story
of the great achiever who leaves a wake of anger and betrayal is a
common one.  So what would it take for you to accept all of that in
pursuit of a goal? What would you want so much that you'd commit
yourself to the necessary hard, endless work, giving up relationships
and other inter- ests, so that you might eventually get it? Whatever
it is that the greatest performers want, that's how much they must
want it.

>Above all, what the evidence shouts most loudly is striking, lib-
erating news: that great performance is not reserved for a preordained
few. It is available to you and to everyone.


Pandian this is for you!


>Coordinating our arms
and legs is more difficult. We've all seen it happen, and anyone in their
thirties or beyond has experienced it. So we might reasonably suppose
that this unavoidable trend spells doom for excellent performance

## Actual summary3

This book deals with the questions like, Is greatness achieved or
inate ?, and how anyone can achieve greatness. A completely
science-backed approach has been delivered by the author Geoffrey
Collin.

### The Mystery

When people think about Mozart, Tiger Woods, Federer they never really
imagine themselves ever getting to such a level of proficiency. They
often marvel at what the legends are doing or have done. And then move
on with their lives. They seem to suggest that such extraordinary
ability is a result of some inate ability or the right genes and push
it off as something that by chance happens to someone and go on with
their lives.

But What separates hard workers from the truly exceptional aka
world-class? Experience? Talent? Intelligence? Memory?

Many people work hard. Look at everyone you know right from your
parents to your siblings and even yourself. But just "working hard"
seems to be not enough to the greatest of the greats aka legend. 

If you look at experience, it does not look like the deciding factor
regarding this. Many studies by leading researchers (TIO chap 1) seem
to show a 0 correlation between experience and getting better, be it
with auditors, clinical psychologists and even surgeons.

> Auditors with years of experience were no better at detecting
> corporate fraud—a fairly important skill for an auditor—than were
> freshly trained rookies.

### Talent is overrated

Talent certainly seems to be overrated. Talent refuses to show itself
even after many many years into the lives of exceptional musicians.

>In a study of outstanding American pianists, for example, you could
>not have pre- dicted their eventual high level of achievement even
>after they'd been training intensively for six years; at that point
>most of them still weren't standing out from their peers.

A standard argument that comes out of any such number of studies
presented is "But what about Mozart, and what about Tiger Woods?"

There seems to be an explanation for these so called anomalies. In
both the case of Mozart and Tiger woods their fathers seem to be
starting them off quite early in their lives and have spent quite some
time building the skill into their children. In the case of Mozart his
father was a highly accomplished pedagogue and in the case of Tiger
Woods, his father played golf quite well and was extremely passionate
about it and was also a teacher.

The question about talent is answered in the fact that his first piece
regarded today as a masterpiece was composed when he was 21. Although
it is an early age, it must be taken into account that the boy has
been in preparation since very very young. Also, current contempraries
(prodigies like mozart) seem to be doing much better than him owing
possibly to improved training methods while measured on a precocity
index (TOI, chap 2).

In Tigers case his father never really claimed any inborn talent, but
he thought that the boy seemed to grasp things rather quickly. And
both of them state Hard Work for the Success of Tiger. 

If you look at Jack Welsh, CEO General Electric, one of the twentieth
century's manager of the century apparently showed no inclination
towards busieness untill his midtwenties.

He finally started working in chemical developement operation at
GE. And apparently until that point there seems to be no point
indicating the business tycoon that he was going to become. 

If talent existed and refused to show itself even after so many years
of life, it beckons the statement if that inate ability (talent) even
exists.

**Could the explanation possibly be genetic?**

Oboe genes are almost certain they don't exist. 

>But practice proponents do not dispute the possibility that genes
> could play a role in a person's willingness to put himself or
> herself through the extremely rigorous demands of becoming an
> exceptional performer.


### Smartness: Intelligence and Memory

Maybe talent seems like it doesn't exist, but intelligence and memory
should probably have a high influence. For example, the top players
where they are because of their supreme intelligence or vast memory

**Intelligence**

A study was conducted in the business realm. Salesmen were an
attractive subject for this study as it is rather clear to measure
output/success. More number of sales more output. The study was the
largest of its kind containing data of several dozen studies amounting
to 45k individuals. Because of such a large number the endless sources
of noise are expected to be drowned. The bosses gave good indication
of the IQ of the person with their ratings and with the help of sales
they actually made, the results were compiled. 

>Intelligence was virtually useless in predicting how well a
>salesperson would perform. Whatever it is that makes a sales ace, it
>seems to be something other than brainpower.

Another investigation on real world performance is with betting of
horses. The goal was to forecast post-time odds. Based on this the
classification of experts and non-experts was done. Both groups seem
to have not much differences in terms of experience at the track,
years of formal education, and even the IQ averages and
variation. 

Further investigation suggested that IQ's didn't help predict if
someone was going to be good or bad at this. A person with IQ of 85
("dull normal") was able to pick out the top horse in 10/10 races. And
a nonexpert with IQ 118 picked up the top horse for 3/10 cases. 

There are a dozen factors that go into deciding the outcome of the
game, like how the horse fared in the last game, track condition
etc... Apparently the low-IQ-experts used far complex models that took
a wide consideration of multiple variables unlike the high-IQ-experts.


And this doesn't stop here. The same traits are observed with Chess,
GO and even scrabble. "Scrabble users below average results on tests
of verbal ability. And some Chess grand masters have IQ that are below Normal.

**And What about memory?**

>master, played forty-five blindfolded games simultaneously in Sao
>Paulo in 1947;

Surely this is a sign of the Divine? Surprise, surprise! A study with
highly skilled chess players and non-experts in chess was done where
all were shown real chess game positions of 25 pieces for 5-10
seconds. The chess masters were able to recall the position of every
single piece, whereas the non-experts were able to recall 4 or 5
pieces. This was followed up with random placement of chess pieces and
the same 5-10 seconds to remember each piece. The chess masters and
the non-experts pretty much ended up with the same results. So,

>The chess masters did not have incredible memories. What they had was
>an incredible ability to remember real chess positions.

or 5-9 chunks of information on the chess board that allowed them to
recall the positions. Similarly even with GO and GOMUKU similar
results were achieved.

>Many decades of research have shown that average short-term memory
>holds only about seven items. The capacity of short-term memory
>doesn't seem to vary much from person to person; virtually everyone's

As reflected later in the book (TOI, Chap 6), remembering 49 games at
once is still a ginormous feat not possible with this short term
memory. More on this later.

There are physical limitations to achievement. Death and
diseases, physical limitations (related to age, personal dimensions
etc...), are some of the things of physical limitations we might have
stopping us from becoming the greats.

<!-- needs repair -->
Other than physical limitations, there is not really clearly
understood or proven non-physical constraints.


### Chap 4 a better IDEA

**Who is Jerry rice?**

> As every football fan knows, Jerry Rice was the greatest receiver in
> NFL history, and some football authorities believe he may have been
> the greatest player at any position.

He was great athlete while already in his senior year but was not NFL
material that all teams fought to sign him. 

>In the 1985 draft, fifteen teams passed him over before the San
>Francisco 49ers finally signed him.

Despite all this the legacy he has left behind him is truly
remarkable.

>For some future player to perform at such an extremely high standard
>for so many years in a physically brutal game is obviously not
>impossible, but history sug- gests that it is unlikely

**What makes him different?**

He always did more. During workouts after catching a pass rice would
sprint to the end zone unlike his other team mates. He would typically
continue practicing by long after the rest of the team left. 

His off-season trainings were so hard that the workouts were not
shared with other teams not because it was confidential, but because
it would possibly cause harm to them. He spent way more time than his
colleagues with his workouts which he completely conducted on his
own. He always seemed to do strenuous cardio and weight
training. People who joined him for these workouts would stop midway
because they got sick. These workouts were considered the most
demanding in the league.

He trained for specific things that was most important for his
success. He knew he could not sprint fast, but then he trained on
other aspects which resulted in speed not making much of a different. 

He defied age limits.

>Wide receivers, who run like hell on most plays and frequently get
>crushed by tacklers, aren't supposed to last twenty sea- sons or
>play until age forty-two. None but Rice has ever done so.

**The crucial finding on what seems to matter**

A study of 3 violin groups from a school, rated by their teachers into
three categories based on their skill level, shows some interesting
insights. Group A and B were the exceptional and the good
performers. Group C were people from a department in the same school
which admitted far less talented students who would become researchers
or teachers. 

All groups were alike, performing a spending similar amount of time in
total for activities such as lessons, practice, exams etc... All
subjects were of the same age as well. 

After a through study it was discovered that groups A and B spent
equal number of hours in practice/week by themselves whereas group C
spent much lesser time in doing this. But this quite did not answer
why Group A and B were so different. Upon a deeper look it was found
that the total accumulated hours of lifetime practice for Group A was
\>7k hours, for group B was 5k hours and for group C it was 3k hours. 

>No matter who they were, or what explanation of their performance was
>being advanced, it always took them many years to become excellent,
>and if a person achieves elite status only after many years of toil,
>assigning the principal role in that success to innate gifts becomes
>problematic, to say the least.

There seems to be a similar trend in other fields as well. For
example, many scientists and authors produce their greatest work only
after twenty or more years of devoted effort. We see that practice
seems key. But researchers think it is much more than that.

>The vast majority of people we work with, or play golf with, or play
>Doom with, got better for a while and then leveled off, having
>apparently reached the limit of their abilities; years of further
>work have not made them any better. On the other hand, we see
>repeatedly that the people who have achieved the most are the ones
>who have worked the hardest. How can both sets of observations be
>true?

Simple practice makes perfect is not enough. These top performers seem
to be doing something more.


### What is deliberate practice and what isn't

Sometimes I go to basketball practice and try a few shots from one
spot. Then I try some drills in ball handling to improve play during
the game. I try multiple variations 2-3 times and get bored and then
play some one-on-ones with someone and feel happy that I have clocked
2 more hours of practice that gets me to amazing levels someday. You
know Practice makes perfect. The author hoists a similar example from
his life with golf balls and says with conviction that this will do
jack shit to your performance. 

The idea of deliberate practice (DP) is quite different from the above form
of practice. Jerry Rice according to the author a near perfect example
of someone who did massive amounts of DP and in the end became legend.

>Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth
>examining. It is activity designed specifically to improve
>performance, often with a teacher's help; it can be repeated a lot;
>feedback on results is continuously available; it's highly demanding
>mentally, whether the activity is purely intellectual, such as chess
>or business-related activities, or heavily physical, such as
>sports; and it isn't much fun.

**It's designed specifically to improve performance.**

One must identify certain sharply defined elements that need
improvement and work on them intently. These practices should be
designed in such a way that they stretch your current abilities.

Apparently the great performers, see a couple of issues and isolate
each one of them and work on them until they have seen sufficient
improvement before moving on to the next aspect. 

It is recommended by the author that they are done with the guidance
of a teacher. In case we think that we have outgrown the benefits of a
teachers help, the author suggests to atleast give it another thought.

While learning we want to be in the zone where we are just beyond our
comfort zone which makes it slightly more motivating than other tasks
that might be daunting to even approach.

**It can be repeated a lot**

In golf the ball rarely gets buried into the sand. Such shots are
rare, that they happen but when they happen you cannot expect to
perform well as you have rarely performed that shot. Top performers
repeat a lot. Isolation of the specific space where you need to
improve is key followed by a lot of repetitions. 

>Ted Williams, baseball's greatest hitter, would practice hit-
>ting until his hands bled. Pete Maravich, whose college basketball
>records still stand after more than thirty years, would go to the gym
>when it opened in the morning and shoot baskets until it closed at
>night.

Following all this, one can work on his technique but it very
important to see progress and get feedback. Otherwise one will stop
getting any better and stop caring. Feedback is crucial to motivation.

Sometimes results might need interpretation, trusting your own
judgment might not really be the best way to go about it. For
example, Paul Graham, before he publishes a post, gets tons of
feedback of from his friends, corrects his article by himself several
times before publishing it. 

These tasks whether physical or not, seem to drain out much of our
mental energy as they are all about improving an unsatisfactory
performance and trying your hardest to improve these. It is estimated
that 4-5 hours of DP seems to be the upper limit, across disciplines,
with sessions frequently lasting no more than 90 minutes. The study of
violinists (TOI chap 4) for example shows that the kids that do DP
slept more not only during the night but also during the afternoons.

<!-- I remember exactly a year back when an STM said to me that he
doesn't --> <!-- need anyone to push him anymore and that he is
counting his hours of --> <!-- practice and finally that he was aiming
for 5 hours -->

**It is painful**

I can imagine working on say things like my sentence construction. I
know I make shit sentences. First I would need to identify good
sentences and try to work on my previous works trying to improve say
sentence by sentence. This could be qualified as DP. But the shear
repulsion to that activity plus the fact that I have to do it makes it
painful. Say with 10k sentences I could be better (of course
I could design some nice feedback around it), it is going to take
quite some time. 

Everyone would achieve greatness if it were easy and fun. But everyone
doesn't and it is not easy and fun. Your willingness to do it will
distinguish you all the more. Think about Jerry Rice again! 

**A dramatic example**

"Laszlo Polgar, a Hungarian educational psychologist, formed the view
in the 1960s that great performers are made, not born.", says the
author. Laszlo married with the intention of using his own kids as the
experiment and raised 3 women to become top level chess players. All
kids were home schooled and made to do DP. There was sufficient
material for study on chess by that time and that is one of the
reasons why chess was chosen.  

All three were great players, but only one is the current world number
1 woman player. It is known within the family that Judith is the one
that worked the hardest and it seems to show. The other two started
having other interests or drifted off from the game.

### Some characteristics of Extraordinary people aka how DP works

**DP'ers perceive more**

DPer's know where to look and where to get more information. If you
consider typewriters, in order to improve speed they look further into
the text and move their fingers in a way to make more speed
happen. Doctors look at X-rays and see far from it than simpler
folk. They understand the significance of the indicators that average
performers don't even notice. Top Tennis players look at the hips and
shoulders of servers to know where the ball is going to go.


**Knowing more**

>You didn't really have to know much about a field if you knew the
>best ways to analyze a problem and think it through, and you needed
>to know even less if your analysis and reasoning power could be
>juiced by a computer

But still the time of computers beating humans hadn't arrived until
recently. Be it in chess or GO. What was missing was the vast
knowledge of the particular positions in different cases and what sort
of choices had what sort of consequences. 

In chess apparently, master-level players posses chess knowledge by a
factor of 10-100 comparted to good club-level players. 

**Remembering more**

Earlier we saw that people in general are capable of holding 5-9
chunks in their head. This is the short-term memory that is being
talking about. In the study of remembering the max number of pieces
and their positions, the chess-masters were able to recollect every
single piece. But, when it came to random arrangements they were as
good as the control group.

This can be imagined like letters and words. Given a word it is easier
to remember if it is familiar and with little effort we can spell it
backwards even, but if the letters are in a random order it is going
to be pretty hard. What chess players could be seeing is words.

And with a rich vocabulary of such words (positions of groups of
pieces), they seem to be doing much more. Apparently researchers have
estimated that good club players have a vocabulary of 100-1000
"words", but a master-level player has a vocabulary of 1k-10k
"words". 

Holding 49 chess games in memory seems to be much more than the short
term memeory. 

>All these people have developed what we might call a memory skill, a
>special ability to get at long-term memory, with its vast capacity,
>in a fast, reliable way. They aren't using short-term memory or
>traditionally defined long-term memory.

A type of memory that becomes better and better over more DP and one
that allows you to retrieve more information or provides hooks for you
to add your information to, more like connections.

A study involving a description of a football game and 2 sets of
people demonstrates this. The description was shown to fans of the
game and random people. After some time recalling the details of the
game was the task. The fans were able to recall the important parts of
the game about who passed to who and the sequence of events, where as
the control group remembered trivial things like when the crowd roared
etc... 

>The fans' high-level knowledge of the game provided a frame- work on
>which to hang the information they had read.

>In the letters-versus-words analogy, it isn't just that novices see
>letters while experts see words; the experts also know the meanings
>of the words.  It's clear that the superior memory of great
>performers doesn't just happen. Since it is built on deep
>understanding of the field, it can be achieved only through years of
>intensive study. It further requires con- sistently relating new
>information to higher-level concepts, which is hard work.

**Changes to physical structure**

The influence of DP on DPer's is even more impressive that the body
actually gets modified in the process. Changes to the body, the brain,
the heart even, can happen to aid you in your field, for you to create
the right type of hooks on which you can hang the wide amount of knowledge.

>En- durance runners, for instance, have larger than average hearts,
>an attribute that most of us see as one of the natural advantages
>with which they were blessed

> Athletes can change not just the size of their
muscles but even the composition of them (the proportion of fast-twitch
fibers to slow-twitch) through years of practice

>The brain's ability to change is greatest in youth, but it doesn't
>end there

The bottomline being that there is path that exists, that runs between
your current abilities to that of of the greats. It is hard, extremely
long and demanding. Not many will follow it all the way till the end.
### Chap 5: applying to our lives

**Know what you want to be**

To begin with you need to know where you want to go. Do you want to be
the greatest basketball player you can be? Do you want to able to
reason and solve problems like an STM? Do you want to be the best at
your work? Do you want huge-ass muscles? Do you want to be amazing
in Data Science? Do you want very good at analyzing problems and
performing research on that (as would be needed by GiveWell)? Do you
want to be able to communicate ideas better?

>The skills and abilities one can choose to develop are infinite, but
>the opportunities to practice them fall into two general categories:
>op- portunities to practice directly, apart from the actual use of the
>skill or ability, the way a musician practices a piece before
>performing it; and opportunities to practice as part of the work
>itself.

So for example, if you look at chess, you can study positions and make
a move and compare it to what and why the grand masters did it. This
is Practicing directly. Another way of DP could be to actually just
play games online and get practice as a result of that.

<!-- filler?-->

**The music model**

When you want to get better at playing an instrument better, you can
think of all the ways it could be done much better. You could improve
on say the trill, or the speed or your knowledge of arpeggios or
coordination of both the hands etc... You look at each aspect. It is
probably easy to isolate and practice them. You can get feedback
looking at the tempo of improvement or from your coach or even watch a
video of yourself.

Thus the music model, where you can see what aspects need
improvement, isolate them and practice them. 

The same thing can be applied to even for real interviews. In essence
it is similar as the key messages are going to be conveyed regardless
of the questions. Here you could look at aspects such as your humour,
your passion, logical flow of thoughts (for example using STAR
method), and the actual messages being delivered well. Feedback from
a mock interview with a friend or recording your self could help. 

For written work, it is probably best to emulate the method of one of
the best writers (as viewed by many) Benjamin Franklin. Here key
aspects to work on could be, grammar, elegance of expression,
perspicuity, organization, vocabulary etc... Benjamin Franklin (BF)
worked on his writing as a result of the feedback from his dad. For
some reason that motivated him to take on DP despite having little
time in addition to the work he was doing.

BF took the best work he could find and wrote down the meaning of each
sentence. A few days later, he would use these notes to form
sentences. And then he compared the original and his work, discovered
some faults and corrected them. His method was thus, look at what
needs to be improved (identify key aspect), try to forcibly write (DP)
and compare with the original. This he seems to have done multiple
times working on every single aspect of his writing. BF used the
Spectator. 

> instead of emulating the Spectator,
> you would choose a superior letter to the shareholders, advertisement,
> blog entry, or other appropriate model.

**The chess model**

In chess isolation of an aspect seems a little out of hand, as key
aspects are probably hard to find. But, with chess, thousands of books
on different positions, different games have been published. The DP
routine would be to look at a particular position and choose a move
and compare it to the move chosen by the master.

Business is like chess. You are presented with a position of a problem
and need to figure out the best move. Even though it is sometimes hard
to evaluate which of the proposed solutions is better, the process of
focusing on the problem and evaluating solutions is in itself
instructive. This is called the case method and apparently Harvard
graduates would have done >500 cases by the time they graduate.

> You might work in marketing for years and get only a couple of
>chances to market U.S. products in China, for ex- ample, so that's a
>skill you probably wouldn't be very good at. But in a short time you
>could study a dozen cases about marketing U.S. products in Our Lives
>in China. That's one step removed from actually marketing the
>products, but it puts you many steps ahead of anyone who has not
>studied that specific skill intensely and repeatedly


**The sports model**

The practice of athletes falls into two aspects in the sports
model. One is conditioning, things that make allow you to perform
certain activities better. If you played NFL, you need speed, and
muscles (for explosiveness). Tennis players work on stamina so that
they can still play at the 3rd hour of the game. The other practice is
working on critical skills like batting the baseball, or serving the
tennis ball in certain locations or hitting the golf ball out of the
sand. The difference between other models and this is that no 2
situations will be exactly the same. The variability plays a huge
role. Every time you pass, the ball in NFL, the positioning of each
player will be different. For a pianist the Beethoven stays the same no
matter what.

For conditioning in information and service based work, its probably
about getting stronger with the underlying cognitive skills; basic
math and accounting for financing, basic science for people in
engineering etc...

>For people who write and edit, the same applies to Fowler's Modern
>English Usage and Strunk and White's The Elements of Style.

There are classic guides available for every field and revisiting them
is one way of improving conditioning. Conditioning can also be done on
new material. Pencil editing a new article, analyzing the basic ratios
of an unfamiliar financial statement etc...

The second type of practice is based on focused simulation. Sometimes
it is difficult to engage in a lot of this practice due to
unpredictable opponents, fast responses and dynamic situations. But it
should still be possible to bat the baseball and swing the golf club or
shoot the ball into the basketball ring, while focusing on high
repetition and immediate feedback.


**For work**

Yes if we would like to become an expert in our field we would read
tons about our field, the history, read everything that the experts
are doing, get insights from colleagues etc... But the goal is to gain
a lot of knowledge about the domain, but not just to just amass
information. The point is that we would like to build a mental model
of how the domain functions. That is the crucial picture.

>This is one of the defining traits of great performers: They all
>possess large, highly developed, intricate mental models of their
>domains.

### DP for innovation

It appears that even being creative is not not possible with DP. Two
myths associated with creativity are a) that it happens suddenly (to
anyone) and b) too much knowledge inhibits creativity. 

**Sudden Creativity**

Although all fields require creativity, some fields in which people
are expected to be really creative are poets, composers and
painters. When Studying 76 composers or 131 painters or even 66 poets,
for their first glorious moment, the answer comes out to be
similar. Within the first years no one produced had their first
glorious moment. With composers it took more than 10 years for most of
them. It seems that you cannot escape the initial years before
achieving greatness.

>Professor Howard Gardner of Harvard wrote a book-length study
>(Creating Minds) of seven of the greatest innova- tors of the early
>twentieth century: Albert Einstein, T. S. Eliot, Sigmund Freud,
>Mahatma Gandhi, Martha Graham, Pablo Picasso, and Igor Stravinsky.

The ten year rule seems to be prevalent irrespective of the field.

**Too much knowledge**

Watt was responsible for the industrial revolution with his giant
innovation. The Newcomen engine wasn't very efficient, but it was
already there, before Watt improved it. The impact of Watt is not at
question here but the point is that there was no sudden spark. Watt's
training as a maker of scientific instruments gave him the skills and
knowledge with which to do it. A similar story occurs with the
innovation of the cotton gin as well. 

>From the telegraph to the airplane to the Internet, they're all
>adaptations and extensions of what existed, made possible by great
>insights but entirely impossible without a deep knowledge of, and
>reliance on, past achievements.

Domain specific knowledge seems key in becoming one of the greats,
however way you see it.





### Great performance in your and age

**Supporting environment**

Starting early certainly has its advantages. You have more time in
your hands, less responsibilities to work on the things important to
you. It is quite possible to acquire 10k hours before reaching 20
years.

Apparently the role of environment is much higher than we
think. Research conducted informs that adolescents are able to sustain
concentrated effortful study (important for DP), in certain
environments characterized as stimulating and supporting environments.

>A stimulating environment was one with lots of opportu- nities to
>learn and high academic expectations. A supportive environ- ment was
>one with well-defined rules and jobs, without much arguing over who
>had to do what, and in which family members could rely on one
>another.

**Defying age**

Research has established quite well that as we age we slow
down. Things such as remembering, solving unfamiliar problems take
twice as much time as young people. Even coordinating the arms and
legs becomes difficult. 

But, Yo-Yo Ma was a world-famous cellist at age twenty who became even
better at 40. Studies in broad range of fields show consistently that
excellent performers (be it in piloting, music, bridge, management),
seem to suffer from the same age-related issues as everyone else,
**except in their domain.** 

This is probably one of the most important outcomes in research. This
fills me with immense joy to know that I don't have to be lame when I
am old and that I can still be thriving atleast in things where I
perform excellently. I immediately recollect the image of Scooby, who
60 years of age and still has the physique of a killer body builder
and endurance of 30 year old. Expert much!

Psychologists measured the response speeds of some old pianists by checking
how fast they could tap their fingers to a choice in the screen. This
was slow as expected. But when the same pianists  were given piano
related tasks like finger taping or finger coordination, they didn't
seem to have slow down at all. 

Corollory: More DP will result in you not sucking with old age.

Arthur Rubinstein continued to perform publicly to great acclaim,
until he was eighty nine. Julio Franco (baseball) played in the 2007
season at age 49, owing to his regimen of intense exercise and diet. A
seventy-four-year-old man in 2004 ran 4 minutes faster than the gold
medal performance of 1896 Olympics. 

>Our brains are perfectly able to add new neurons well into old age
>when conditions demand it, and brain plasticity doesn't stop with
>age. Give your brain the right kind of training—for example, by making
>it try to do two things at once—and plasticity will increase in the
>regions that normally show the greatest atrophy in later years.

> Warren Buffett continues to run Berkshire Hathaway brilliantly in
> his late sev- enties. Rupert Murdoch, at about the same age, is
> aggressively expand- ing his huge media conglomerate, News
> Corporation.

Eventually of course the age catches on. Warren Buffett has decided to
retire. Arthur Rubinstein gave up performing publicly at eighty-nine
because he was becoming deaf and blind. 

But what pushes them so far, with the continual practice, painful
pushing beyond what's comfortable, for many hours a day and years on
end? Why do chess grand masters continue to work for 4-5 hours a day
studying chess position when it does not necessarily bring wealth?

>Why do some young businesspeople push themselves beyond their jobs'
>considerable daily demands to acquire more knowledge and skills when
>the payoff is uncertain and may be years away?

### Where does passion come from?

In essence Shizuka Arakawa, a figure skater, during her practice had
fallen on her ass 20000 times atleast before she finally won the gold
medal for Olympics in 2006. But why?

**Two kinds of motivation**

There are two kinds of motivation. One is the intrinsic kind and the
other is the extrinsic kind. Motivated by factors from within such as
the need to achieve, the need to power over others, even the need to
do good in the world, are intrinsic motivators. Extrinsic motivators
motivate us extrinsically such as the need for money. What Shizuka
Arakawa had seems to be the intrinsic.  

Intrinsic motivation and high creative achievement go hand in hand
according to research. A wide range of creative achievers seem to be
devoted to great questions or problems in their field and feel driven
to pursue them for decades. 

But how can something that is not fun at all (as we have seen until
now) be intrinsically motivating? Mihaly Csikszentmihali suggests a
mechanism that connects the intrinsic motivation and demands of
DP. His work on "flow" suggests a state where time slows down,
enjoyment is heightened and the painfulness of the task becomes not
observable. When the tasks are easy then it gets boring. When tasks
involved are challenging enough that they just stretch us beyond our
skills, then we are in flow. If it gets too challenging then we get
frustrated. 

Top-level performers in sports seem to rate practice high on the scale
of enjoyableness. But the violinists seen in Ericsson's study seem to
rank it as not enjoyable. The sharp contrast continues.

Extrinsic motivation however is expected to not get people to the
greatest heights. But, 

>When Watson and Crick were struggling to find the structure of DNA,
>they worked almost nonstop because they knew they were in a race with
>other research teams. Al- exander Graham Bell worked similarly on the
>telephone, knowing he was in competition with Elisha Gray, whom he
>beat to the patent office by just hours.

Not all extrinsic motivators are bad. Extrinsic motivators that
re-enforces intrinsic motivation could still work effectively.

>Recognition that confirms competence turned out to be
>effective. While the mere expectation of being judged tended to reduce
>creativity, per- sonal feedback could actually enhance creativity if
>it was the right kind—"constructive, nonthreatening, and work-focused
>rather than per- son-focused," in Amabile's words. That is, feedback
>that helped a person do what he or she felt compelled to do was
>effective.

These extrinsic motivators that re-enforce the intrinsic motivation
benefit kids especially in the early stages. Parents instead of
saying,"if you don't practice we'll cancel your allowance," seemed to
say "if you don't practice we'll take the piano away". Of course this
worked only the child cared about the piano. With time the students
become responsible for their own motivation.

Sometimes apparently there are cases where kids show amazing drive to
do something, like a 10 month old baby crying for paper and pen to
draw all the time. Although, the people who do become top-level
achievers are rarely child prodigies. This is certainly true in
business, if you look at the early lives of Welches, Ogilvies, and
Rockefellas. There was no hint at the success that was about to
come.

>Time and again the story is the same: Even by age eleven or twelve
>it would have been difficult to predict who the future exceptional
>performers would be.

**Multiplier effect**

>In virtually every field, beginners can't manage more than an hour

>five hours a day. It isn't quite right to say only that the practice

Some spark seems to have started, just like in the kid who started
taking piano seriously, once he saw at close range an actual pianist
performing.


**Summary**

Becoming the greatest involves a large investment of time and
resources. The price people often pay to rise to the top of any
field are quite high.

>Howard Gardner, after studying his seven excep- tional achievers,
noted that "usually, as a means of being able to con- tinue work, the
creator sacrificed normal relationships in the personal sphere." Such
people are "committed obsessively to their work. Social life or
hobbies are almost immaterial." That may sound like admirable
self-sacrifice and direction of purpose, but it often goes much
further, and it can be ugly.

>Above all, what the evidence shouts most loudly is striking,
>liberating news: that great performance is not reserved for a
>preordained few. It is available to you and to everyone.

### summary of chapters

Chapters 1,2,3 are all about what defines you and how it is not
relevant to the picture of success. Chapter 4 talks about DP the
number of hours the violinists used and why this is so important. It
also talks about Jerry Rice and why he might be the greatest. 

Chapter 5 thoroughly talks about what is and isn't DP., Chap 6 is not
relevant to application. Chap 7 is about applying it with the three
models and thats it.

Chapter 8 just focusses on debunking myths.

Chapter 9 is about age and tells you why you need to DP like a bitch.

Chap 10 attempts to talk about passion but does not provide anything
fruitful. But I think I shall go with the idea of mihally. thats it.


So basically Chap 4, 5, and 7 that are about the principles.

## Criticism

[Some psycologists from Michigan State University (MSU)](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/opinion/sunday/sorry-strivers-talent-matters.html) seem to think
that Geoff's book is not presenting all the facts and give a few
examples of studies that might suggest that Geoff in his conclusion
might be wrong.

Geoff, constantly seems to be focusing on one thing and one thing
alone. What separates the greatest of the greats from normal folk. And
I suspect he has done a tremendous job of presenting the goddamn
evidence. 

The MSU professors of psychology, seem to be conveniently forgetting
that Geoff is primarily and only focusing on the greats, and their
rebuttal is anything but a rebuttal as they seem to be focused on
regular folk.
