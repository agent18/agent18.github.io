#### My rough list!

<!-- <\!-- I think this needs to GO, DELETE! -\-> -->

Roughly I imagine the list to be:

1) Continuing in the same job or being a design engineer and rising
the ranks as so.

- Far too specific information learning at the moment (suspect it is useless)

As echoed previously to myself and in my archive, it appears that I am
learning something too specific, like how to make drawings and how to
design in tight tolerances, these are far too specific

- I do a bit of trouble shooting and critical thinking, I would like
  to do more.

- I do not want to work on puzzling out more about volumes and
interferences manually, say using (god-forbid) powerpoint. for
example, things I could do with a better tool. Of course I could have
a better way of work. Well let there be better problems to solve.

2) An MBA to management consulting or IB or trading(very high job
satisfaction according to 80k-hours) for now, hoping to get some
experience and a lot of money, to propel career ahead.

Right now it appears that the an MBA can open avenues into consulting,
IB and Trading. These seem to allow to get good experience and a lot
of money. Job satisfaction and long hours might suffer for a few.

Other than doing an MBA there dont seem many options. And I have
echoed my sentiment to a couple of MBA graduates who seem to agree
([IB at JP Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ram-narayan-86b7b199/)),([Marketeer from Newyork who has scholarships in
MBA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rawanalhaffar/)), Another friend who is an Analyst in California going into
product management.

But right now I do not need to make the choice of what I will be
taking. I can leave that decision for sometime in the future.

3) Data science (research, critical thinking?), moving on to
programming or not

I sort of club DS and programming together. As I see DS my first
direction to go into even if programming is what I might do in the
end. DS already involves some programming and I can get a job I think
quickly (3 months) in Netherlands and from there get better at it and
programming and see where it takes me. Although, DS would be much more
oriented towards critical thinking I guess.

4) Starting up

No idea where to start, no ideas of what to start, lack of skill and
confidence. A tech start-up sounds interesting, maybe I could find
some work there. I could go over to some meeting in rotterdam and see
what the scene is like.

I think we should expect a long lead time with tech startups,
especially ones that involve making a phisical product of any
nature.

Although I am currently working in a startup I see that I don't have
any "startup benifits"

5) Joining an EAO (Effective Altruism organization), starting as an Intern

6) Data-science or Programming in Finance (best of two worlds)
	
#### My next steps 

<!-- This has to go too -->

The focus for this article should be that I develop through this post
what I should do next, like in the next 6 months. Where should I begin
and what should I do.

I am broadly looking at few things based on the rough list I have and
the Career Quiz

1. Sticking to design engineering

	- Working in the US?
	- Staying in DE
	- Attempting to startup
	- Going into the NGO management after a few years in this field.
	
2. Moving to DataScience
   
   - DS
   - Programming
   - Machine learning PhD
   - Working at GiveWell type of NGO's
   
3. Doing an MBA

	- IB
	- NGO as analyst or management
	- Management Consulting
	- Marketting Sales
	- trading in quantitative hedge funds
	
	
4. Civil services

	Dont know where or how to start, other than in India, but I am not
    sure of the evaluating the kind of impact I can have in India
	
5. Think Tanks

6. Working at Effective Altruism organizations

### Questions to Ram

1. Can I multiply prolties? Is there a better way to do this while
   comparing different options

So I am attempting to estimate which career is my best fit. In order
to do that I look at the chances of an event A, B to G. I multiply all
of these chances to get my personal fit.

The problem is though, with every career, my events are quite
different and the number of events also are different.

Also, the more number of events I have my personal fit automatically
goes down big time. 80% probabilities in 2 events will give me a very
bad personal fit of 64%.

Can you comment on if this is the way of the world or can I do better?

**Answer**
Ram suggests to use atleast the same number of events for each case.

2. What is the best way to estimate lifetime salary.

My typical approach is assume a salary growth of 4% an inflation of 2%
and 10% increase every 5 years and take it all the way till I am 70.

By doing this my estimate really large salaries when I am say 70. I am
afraid it is realistic. So for example, my current salary is 40k/year,
I claim it to become 362k/year when I am 70.

Sometimes I really know what the salary is going to be at a certain
level and then I use that directly, say in the case of Management
Consulting.

Is there a better approach? Your thoughts on what I can do better and
what I am doing wrong.

**Answer:**
Above 45 the rise in salary cannot be as much as 4%. 

3. While evaluating careers. 

lets take MBA track with becoming partner, leaving Mc after 5 years or
do something else.

While estimating the P of each of this, the P of MBA multiplies.

I look at it like independent tracks, but in reality they are backup
options, which I will take up based on how they pan out.

How can I caliculate resulting number of balls I can buy?

**Answer**

P(partner)*impact of partner+P(mc)*feefles;

This might actually change some results and the contribution or the
total lives it can save Huh?

#### IB

[Rubin and Archer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ibMt0kQiw)were analysts quit IB for the following reasons:

- Despite putting 80-100 hrs/ week they still had to kiss ass,
  sometimes it doesn't make 
  
- Exit options are good apparently

- Mundane, not really, mainly ppts.

- Work goes unnoticed if kissing ass is not done 

- pretend to do work, when there is no work

- Very competitive

- Can learn the finance skills in 6 months.

- analyst to associate almost needs in MBA go in private equity and
  hedge funds (500k$)
  
- MBA for higher ups anyway most people.

- The skills you learn in IB can be got within 6 months (finanacial modelling), you don't
  really need to spend years working here to gain the skills
  
- Pure skills might be more freaking valuable or business skills that
  will allow you to scale a company from the ground up
 
- POlitics Bonus... 

- Pretend to do work... 

- Whether they like you are not. Unhealthy!

- They might not use your work everything you sacrificed. 

- He missed his cousins wedding and they still took the name out of
the book he made.

- If you focus on Statups and gaining crazy skill, then you will get
equity. and a fulfilling career. Stick to this part of the game.

----- 

What is IB?

Supporting companies that do mergers. Nothing sexy. As analysts
support the bbuying selling of companies, raising capital etc...

What do they do Day to Day?

There is an organizational schematic. The associate will drop at 7pm
in the evening a task of making 100 pages of document within the next
morning with good graphs and stuff that the higher ups can deal with.

Do market research, projections on excel what the company can
	buy... they present the ppt and engage as advisor. 1-2 months
	
Is IB fun?

Everybody is super excited. 100 hrs a week, not working on models
every week, lot of politics, youre even changing font colors on
things.

Lot of analysts use IB as a stepping stone finance and the corporate
world... exit opportunities. Hedge funds and private equity after 3
years. I am not sure I am 

21 years-  80-90k base ...signing bonus 10k ... bonus at the end of
the year...  75% to 100% of annual salary. 150 to 200 k ... By the 3rd
year you could make 250k . 150k easily @ 22 years. 100 hrs a week.


Exit opportunities: 

looks good on the resume.... good for MBA to exit to


Avg day: 8 to 9 am start.. 3-4 deals... need ppt by 3pm.. do
stuff... models draft by 2pm... follow up work for to other
things...until 7 pm. 

After that... you sometimes have to work until 2am and even drop off
the stuff at your MD's house. if you go to sleep at 6 am you are still
expected to come back to work at 10am. (get out of here)

Doesn't happen everyday, but it does happen. NO Weekends

168 hrs - 100 hrs work -40 hrs sleep = 28 hrs!

They have breaking into startups.

## Who earns the most

People in management law or Finance


## Consultant

X-BCG employee is glamourous?



## MBA

There are couple of things one can do after an MBA, such as management
consulting, Investment Banking Private Equity, Hedge Funds, Trading. 

I barely have a clue of what each of this is. 

In [this post](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/152549/working-for-mckinsey-bain-and-boston-consulting-vs-goldman-jpm-and-morgan-stanley) the difference between an IB'er and an MC't is
seen. 

> Investment banking (IB) denotes a financial service that creates
> capital for individuals and organizations, according to one
> definition. Investment bankers (i-bankers, or just “bankers”) give
> investors counsel on market strategies that can minimize their risks
> and maximize their returns. They provide assistance for mergers,
> acquisitions, and restructuring. Risk management is a major part of
> the i-banker job. - [MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/)


>A management consultant (MC) provides expert advice to businesses on
>operations, restructuring, and cost reduction. They are called upon
>to create strategies to help companies make a turnaround. They look
>at what their client companies have been doing and suggest what they
>can do to perform better. MCs deal with different types of problems
>and, for example, may be called upon to suggest to a marketing team
>how to improve its product delivery or advise HR people how to create
>a new health plan for employees.-[MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/)

It is clear from the above that one majors in Finance and the other
just in about anything to help a company get back or improve. MC's are
generally generalists, but somehow in the end are working for a
particular type of industry. 

Job satisfaction is expected to be better in MC than in IB, and the
hours are not that bad as in IB. Sometimes we work weekends, sometimes
not. IB in addition to all this shit, needs Facetime and 

Pay in MC is about 30-50% of an IB'er.

Pay in MC is detailed [here](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/nl-en/246284/work-in-management-consulting-how-much-you-will-make-at-mckinsey-bcg-and-bain). It appears that at Mckinsey one
earned in the year of 2017 an average salary of 140k. Which basically
a high performing engineer in apple can doing DS. [80k says a similar
salary for an associate as well (80 to 170k)](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/)

**PE** is usually seen as an exit opportunity for IB. I googled what
it is and found some finance jargon and I leave it at that. PE can be
as bad as IB in terms of hours clocked or not depending on somethings,
but the pay gets even higher than in IB is my understanding according
to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ibMt0kQiw). People usually work for a few years in IB and then
move on to PE. PE apparently has more interesting work. Hours are
better when deals are not being made. But if in the middle of the deal
16 hours. But PE hours for juniors might still be punishingly
hard. Pay is same apparently according to [this source](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/nl-en/178146/honest-account-working-promised-land-private-equity), but
somehow the environment is better and chances of a burn out are
less. The hours still look bad according to this [quora post](https://www.quora.com/Whats-it-like-to-work-in-private-equity).

**Hedge funds**

 So you start at a company
and based on the amount of success you add, you get a corresponding
compensation. So in the beginning years it is not really high as you
need time to learn the tricks of the game. 

>We found that junior traders typically earn $300k – $3m per year, and
>it’s possible to reach these roles in 4 – 8 years. Senior portfolio
>managers can easily earn over $10m per year,-[80khours-hedgefunds](https://80000hours.org/2017/05/how-much-do-hedge-fund-traders-earn/)

- Money is crazy. 
- Hours are not as bad as in IB (50-60hrs). Apparently as the job
  revolves around capital markets and market closes.

As pleasant as that may sound, a brief view of what happens as [shown
here](http://www.lifeonthebuyside.com/buy-side-analyst-good-bad-day/) wants you to get away from this as well. I cannot deal with
these things knowingly that they will happen some time. I am not cut
out for this, I think. I have hated it always and I would liek to add
value in a different way.

In all of these programs it is to be understood that there is crazy
competition and you need to be the best of the best. Also there is the
possibility of market crashing affecting you. With all the stress I
doubt I will be able to eat sometimes, or go to the gym even.

#### chances hedge fund
Earnings need to be corrected for chances of leaving a job to more
operational roles, future prospects of industry and personal fit.

## Economics Phd

Non quantitative background would need additional training. Being a
ME, I am not sure what I need.

165+ in GRE is definitely achievable with some training. 


### Personal fit

I don't know how much of a fit it is. So I am trying to estimate my
fit..

In [here (80k non-quants bc help)](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/) I find that it is rather hard to
get an Economics PhD, if we haven't done MATH or ECONOMICS. Atlest
that the switch wont be straightforward. 

Although I am in Engineering, the switch we are looking according to
the link above seems to be 1-3 years, i.e, doing a transition course
and then a masters and gathering up some decent references and then
trying to get a PhD.

I think it makes sense to consider what happened. It appears that
University of Florida (UF) is ranked 105 in 2015, the year I had
joined and TU delft is ranked 17 for mechanical engineering according
to [here](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2015/engineering-mechanical). Checking on another site informs me that TU delft is
fucking ranked 18. Get out of here!

That is going for me to say that I have actually been studying here
instead of in the US. 

The credentials that got me here in Mehanical engineering

Although I do see really fucking stupid people overall in TUDELFt,
unfortunately even in material science. People who are so stupider
than me. Who basically studied shit in their bachelors and yet got
admitted to rank 18 university. 

To further comment about TU delft. I see that, even in my batch, there
were some really intelligent people or rather, people who have done
some realted work on a subject before, but I could match their
intelligence by putting in more hours than they did with their social
life. 

The master that I joined also had one really dumb person, who somehow
managed to finish it. My problem is TU Delft although a credential
doens't reflect my capability. Although, I would say I will be inthe
80% of my class. mostly. I am not very dumb or anything, and towards
the 2nd year, I also earned quite some >9s in my subjects in subjects
that had a lot of math involved, also dynamics and the like. This I
can highlight for the team.

Coming back I cannot claim crazy references to get an eco phd. I
suspect I have better references now, example, Rixen, Matthijs from TU
Munich and Tu delft, and maybe Sandipan or Palram from IIT. Mostly I
should just do some economics course and score highly there say even
on course era or something. I need to get evaluated how good I could
be to get an Eco Phd from then on.

I think speaking to an Eco Phd guy or looking at the two guides I have
in front of me, shed more light.

But according to [ here (person from non-quants background)](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/), 

>The most straightforward route is to do either the one year economics
>diploma at Cambridge or the two-year masters at LSE (which has a year
>diploma at the beginning). These courses are designed for people who
>have done other subjects for undergrad, and if you do well in the
>first year you can progress on to do a masters. If you perform highly
>in the masters program, and line up some good references, you stand a
>shot at getting into a US PhD program at the end (and an even better
>shot of getting into an UK PhD).

Sounds like a 60% chance at best.

a) I don't have the money now to do a diploma 
b) If even then you "only have a shot", its not that good of a bet to
be placed.

Apparently a lot of harvard graduates have done a masters and then a
year of work in research to obtain a stellar reference, that gets them
some place good. 

[Certainity of finding soe job exists for sure](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html) according to Noah

My uncertainity lies in how do you define good?

How much time I need to prep for an eco master?

Frankly speaking Harvard is obviously not for me.




### How much good can you do?

[Here is one low probability scenario](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) working in the US federeal
Government agency. 

The article shows a true EA't who clearly looked at numbers and did
some amazing things. He seems very much in touch with reality, seems
to truly understand the value of one goddamn human life. So fucking
Inspiring. Wow. 

Coming back to actual impact, the author claims that a 20 year career
high of the person who interviewed him to be: raising some questions
during a meeting that probably has saved farmers from tens of millions
of dollars, in total. Thats it.

And probably nothing to this level will ever happen again.

>This is what you can expect your direct impact to be as an agency
>economist: find ways to save people money and make life a little less
>difficult for them, while still accomplishing the mission of the
>agency. This is a good life and a noble calling, for those who think
>about efficiency and the big picture, and it is unreasonable to
>expect more.

The author also shared his own stories in this regard wherein he ended
up with saving an estimated 400 lives (somehow only). Plus he also
earns more than 100k and is able to donate 30k, saving atleast 10k
people .

The key points to remember are:

>The main message of this story is that the direct impact of a
>government economist is extremely high-variance. Most of the time,
>you will do nothing to make the world better. Occasionally, you will
>do something that prevents a few million dollars from being
>wasted. And if you get very very lucky, you might do something that
>saves the statistical equivalent of hundreds of lives.

### Am I good enough?

- High grade (min. 3.5+)

Based on [authority conversion of dutch score to US](https://www.studyinholland.nl/documentation/grading-systems-in-the-netherlands-the-united-states-and-the-united-kingdom.pdf) and wiki's [internal
US conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States), I think my grade is 4.0/4.0. [Another source](https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/764/how-are-grades-different-in-the-netherlands-compared-to-the-us.html)
suggests that my grade 3.75. Both seems to be decent. 

- I will work hard on quants and try to obtain 165+ in GRE

I think I can. But Verbal I have no control over.

- Good reference letters

This is the thing that I have not much idea about.

## To Vinod

### Earning potential if you make partner 

**Impact**

- partner after 45

	- At associate level we get 130k 
	- after 5 years 250k
	- after 7 years 450k
	- 600k + bonus after 7 more years say
	- inflation of 2%
	- retiring at 57
	- getting 75% last drawn for the rest of life (another 20 years
      atleast)
	- I didn't take into account the bonuses which is expected to be a
      lot more.


- Earning by once we leave industry in 5 years

	- With compound interest of 4% a year
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- for a beginners salary of 150k (assumption i.e., after quitting
      MC)
	  
## Age

Learning to program later in life:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4350827

A decent site quoting studies and not quora for crying out loud
http://www.mempowered.com/aging/why-learning-harder-we-get-older

17 year olds were affected much more by interference in learning than
were 9 or 12 year olds.

Quoting some scientist
https://www.fastcompany.com/3045424/what-it-takes-to-change-your-brains-patterns-after-age-25

In the above article they talk about how we can make new pathways when
we are young and that as we get old it will be harder. I doubt that I
am unable to learn something new say when I am 32. 

Granted it will slower than I can now due to the plasticity thingy,
granted there will be young people who are faster than me in
that, but I suppose I have laid down some foundation for it. By that I
mean it won't be completely new.

The thing I am worried about is about having enough time to learn it
and having opportunities to intern and then change job.

I am looking for an answer where people tell me "Don't try to learn
something completely new at the age of 35" for example.
## Startup employee ( archived)

I guess I need to split it as an additional contribution.

We expect lower impact, risk and personal demands than a co-founder, 

>If you get the opportunity to join a startup that’s taking off, you
>may have greater earnings and impact by joining it than founding your
>own e.g. the 100th employee of Dropbox still made about $10m,
>equivalent to a 10% stake in a $100m company. -
>[Startup-employee-80000-hrs](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/startup-early-employee/)

The situation we envision and work out odds for is that, we join at
the beginning of a taking off startup and we are say 50-100 employees
into a big ass startup.

I keep the values for this quite rough. To me this appears as an
option in addition to something I choose. When I am at the position of
applying for jobs, that is when I should evaluate how important it
is.

**Skills**

Depends on startup and the things you do, for example, DE, or DS or
management etc... Lets give it an 8, assuming that if you are one of
the first 50-100 employees you are probably given a lot of
responsibility and somehow the skills and knowledge become
transferable.

8/10.

**Connections**

Depending on the job and whom we have to interact with we might have
much larger set of connections.

Whether these connections will get you somewhere? depends and for the
uncertainty, it gets 6.

**Credentials**

It is very uncertain and depends on the field of choice. I say this
because the Credentials I have evaluated are different based on the
fields chosen.

Usually though if it is a high impact startup then you probably have
better credentials. I think this is tough to evaluate. I give it a
value of 7, sort of like an average of the fields I have seen until now.

**Runway**

Will be lower than a normal job in the beginning. 6.0 in the beginning
I guess.


**Personal fit**

As said earlier I will evaluate this further in the coming days when I
am in the lookout say for a job.

I am already working in a startup. When talking about how successful I
will be? 

Unfortunately the odds are that of how successful any startup would be
or how a startup would grow to be the next Airbnb etc... We will use
the same numbers as in `Founding a startup section`.

0.03%. The personal fit is ofcourse only for the extra contribution.

**Impact**

Impact in a startup is estimated at 8k lives. 

>Instead of receiving about 20% of the company’s equity, as a founder
>would, you’ll receive 0.1% – 1% depending on your role and how early
>you join, and you’ll receive more of your compensation as salary
>rather than equity. - [80k-hours startup employee](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/startup-early-employee/)

So the resulting impact is expected to be, lets say 0.5% of 8k = 40
in addition to the impact a normal engineer would have over his
lifetime, which is about 200-300 lives.

Of course there are other ways of increasing the number of lives
saved, but these could just well be our conservative estimates.

**Supporting conditions**

It cannot be as intense as it is for the co-founder. This is pretty
much the impression I get. Trainings and learnings from experienced
people might not really be present here. 

It would be a lot of responsibility. Might have good autonomy and
decent working hours. It will certainly fit with the rest of my life
relationships etc..

## Management Consulting

- MC with a focus on becoming partner

		rough-impact = 1.3% x 1250 = 15 lives
		
	The rough-impact seems to really suggest that Management
	Consulting with a focus on becoming partner is useless. The
	effective impact is computed with the below table as 708
	lives. 
		
	{:.tablestyletwo}
	| Crossroad             | Success | Other | #lives if Success | #lives if failure | EI: Success | EI: failure |
	|-----------------------|---------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
	| GMAT                  | 70.0%   | 30.0% | NA                | 790               | 471         | 237         |
	| Scholarship           | 60.0%   | 40.0% | NA                | 790               | 357         | 316         |
	| McKinsey              | 50.0%   | 50.0% | NA                | 50%x700           | 368         | 263         |
	| 5+ yrs & 60+ hrs/week | 51.0%   | 49.0% | NA                | 700               | 392         | 343         |
	| Make partner          | 12.5%   | 87.5% | 1,250             | 700               | 156         | 613         |


    Looking at the effective-impact seems to suggest completely
different things, mainly because the rough-impact is missing what
happens in the case of failure.

    Explanation of the above table is as follows: Imagine this as a
	decision tree with each step branching into success and
	failure. At each Success node, branches the next step. 'Success'
	column denotes the personal fit at each stage. '#lives if success'
	is nothing but the impact. 'EI: Success' and 'EI: Failure', is the
	effective value obtained at each node in the branch. For example,
	at the 'Make partner' step, I have 156 lives saved if success, and
	613 lives effective saved in case of failure. This is obtained by
		
		'EI: Success' =  Success x '#lives if Success'; 
		'EI: Failure' = Failure x '#lives if failure';
		Effective value  = 'EI: Success' + 'EI: Failure'
	
	As we move up to the previous branch we have to take into account
    the effective value from the next step. i.e., 
	
		'EI: Success' = Sucess (n) x Effective value (n+1) 
		'EI: Failure' = Failure x '#lives if failure';
	
	This is carried on till the top of the branch, i.e., 'GMAT'. One
    thing that needs explanation is the '#lives if failure'
    column. This is done as follows: If I prep for GMAT and fail, I
    can always go back to say Data Science with almost negligible
    loss. That is why the effective-impact of Data Science (790 lives)
    is used. The same goes for when I apply to certain universities
    for scholarship and don't get in. Once I do my MBA and find that I
    don't have a job in the top companies, then I expect my self to
    have only half the impact of an exit opportunity after working in
    Mckinsey. Step 4, after 5 or 6 years of work in case I decide to
    take the exit opportunities, such a career path has the potential
    to save 700 lives. If after 20 years if I don't become partner
    then I suspect I can atleast meet the impact of taking an exit
    opportunity (700 lives). The effective value of such a decision tree
    becomes then: **708 lives.**


**Reflection**
### Programming, Machine learning PhD 

Apparently, learning to program could also be a gateway to DS,
Quantitative Finance, tech entrepreneurship, research and freelance
development. Useful in a multitude of industries, highly
transferable. But I am far from being a programmer. I still think DS
is the first place to start, as it allows me to immediately move to
the other industry and start gaining experience.
	
Also I am not sure how I will compete with all those programmers who
have been programming since they were kids. So I need time and a lot
of it. The same goes for Machine Learning PhD. So instead of staying
in DE I will go to DS, which already has some programming. I will pick
it up from there more about programming.

<!--  I think I need to understand what it means to programm. i.e, -->
<!--  what job I can do and what is the min. requirement to do that. -->

These could result in being the most fulfilling careers, but that is
not the only motive here. 

So for now I will start with 

But maybe then you decide to go into programming instead of DS..

<!-- need to check this out instead -->

## Things I am wrongly focussing on

Aiyoo word count poidumay if I delete it all!!!! 

Lack of clarity or path of flow.

	So many things are hindering my flow and I refuse to do anything
	about it, like start afresh or properly reqiret... 
	
It is ok to throw away everything. ~~wordcount~~ ~~STM should know how
much effort I put in this thing~~ **Clarity** **ability to choose the
best career that makes maximum impact is**, **allowing others to have a
readable document so that they can learn from me** is king

I need to refactor, look at what I have written until now and reqrite
it. This is much more pleasurable than attempting to edit every
sentence. But this will be time consuming. For now I don't see
any other way.

## Analysis
		
I have now two sets of data one that I made including my personal fit,
all based on articles mostly from 80k and around. The other being the
set of data from[ 80k's career reviews'](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) summary of numbers. I
didn't directly use 80k-hours-career-review-numbers, as I wanted some
more information that was not available. For instance MC for ETG and
MC for DW have different impacts, not fully investigated or talked
about by 80k-hours. Another problem is that I do not know how to
compare ETG and direct impact parameters. So it was necessary that I
generated my own values. Of course a small sanity check is done
comparing the 2 sets of data before moving on.

**Sanity check for Career Capital:**

| my rank | My result     | rank 80k |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| 1       | MC            | 1        |
| 2       | Econ PhD      | 2        |
| 3       | IB            | 3        |
| 4       | DS            | 2        |
| 5       | Working @ NGO | 2        |
| 6       | Starting up   | 2        |
| 7       | DE            | -        |

80k-hours evaluates DS better than IB in CC. But if you can go from IB
to MC, PE, hedge funds and other exit opportunities, I don't see why
it is bad in CC. Maybe the limited learning while in IB is reflected
in the CC in 80k-hours-reviews. This is fine. If required I will
later fine tune the results if I find them to be critical. 

**Sanity check impact**

With 80k-hours-reviews the impact is split up into three factors
(Direct impact, ETG and advocacy) and rated separately, this is not of
much use to me as I want to compare things based on total impact. So
it is attempted to make one number out of the three factors.

For 80k-career-reviews ranking, we simply sum up those 3 ratings and
produce the final ranking. In my way of calculation, I compute total
impact to the extent possible by translating everything into
equivalent money and then translate it to lives by (roughly) dividing
it with 4000$ (,the cost of a life according to AMF).

| my rank | Work                            | rank (80k) |
|---------|---------------------------------|------------|
| 1       | Starting up                     | 1          |
| 2       | IB(ETG)                         | 3          |
| 3       | MC(as a partner)                | 3          |
| 4       | Direct working @ EAO (DS etc..) | 1          |
| 5       | Econ PhD. with rare chance      | 6          |
| 6       | MC (exit after 5 year)          | -          |
| 7       | DS/SE in the US                 | 5          |
| 8       | DE in the US                    | -          |
| 9       | DS in Europe                    | -          |
| 10      | DE in Europe                    | -          |

80k-summed-up-ranking suggests that DW has better impact than IB,
which I am not so sure about based on the numbers I have estimated
regarding total impact. In any case, it does not appear that I might
take IB due to the lack of supporting conditions. In addition, the
whole point of the exercise of determining numbers for impact and
career capital is to mainly remove the options that are obviously
bad. The numbers are not accurate, they are conservative to various
degrees, and also there is uncertainty.The personal fit are so disparate that I
hope that they will actually make the real difference, rather than me
doing anything.

With this I conclude the sanity check and say that the data is
accepted for further analysis.

### How to equate CC and IT

So now in my analysis, as per the guidance of 80k-hours-guide, I find
that there is CC and then there is impact.

I am early in my career (27) and would like to place more weight on
flexible CC. I do not want to completely choose based on
FCC. Ultimately we would like one number from all careers to
compare. So we need to translate CC units to that of Impact (number of
lives saved). The following suggestions are considered and weighed
against.

1. Impact of EAO = CC of MC ; Everything from there could just be a
linear extrapolation.

Seems to be a reasonable estimate I think as MC is the best in CC
according to 80k-hours-guide (5 stars) and Direct Impact of EAO has 5
stars as well.

I think what I am doing here is compare achievable CC to Achievable
impact. This sounds reasonable?

2. Rate max best CC as 10 and best IT as 10.

But the problem is that impact is like very non linear. There is
impact of 400 and there is like 10 times its impact.

Say I know something that can save 8k lives and then something that
can save 400 lives. 8 lives can be 10 and 400 lives can be 0.5. But
then in CC, IB could have a max 10 and DE could have a 5 already. If
we add it up directly then the contribution of impact is so low for
DE. What does this mean? I 

I am afraid it is not weighed properly

Define properly. If there is an accepted number of CC which can
correlate with Impact. Maybe even then we have lot of problems. 


### Looking at the ranking

The second best option seems to be DS in NL as ETG. Shocked! I guess
it is because of the ridiculous personal fit that this has happened.
IB is out of the question. I am really afraid of burning out, the way
of work is quite unhealthy and I need to take care of myself for
serving mankind in the long run.

**CC**
MC seems promising CC wise. But say I find out I am not partner
material or I didn't get a scholarship or the hours are sick, then ETG
is not really an option, so I have to move out. When I move out yes I
can do other things, join a company bla bla and rise the ranks. What I
am uncertain about this is being able to work in an EAO. 

MC is my decentest chance of maximizing ETG. And it is not really out
of my scope I think, although my personal fit might say otherwise. The
personal fit factors in a ton of uncertainity and path that I have
chosen i.e., an MBA without scholarship sounds unimaginable. In case
it is not the cut for me, then with the GREATEST CC (5 stars on 80k) I
should be able to pick up my shit and do other things. But, the other
best way to create impact is by working at an EAO. *My uncertainity is
whether I am allowed to work at an EAO*.

<!-- MC in EAO OK/NOK: mail rob now -->

Given 6 months more, my personal fit estimate would have improved
because, that is how long I plan to take to prepare for GMAT and give
a score. By then I can make a better decision to move out to DS byt
year 28- whats in another few months. It seems like I should be able
to pick up DS with a delay of 6 months. I don't see it as a problem.

I assume the impact due to an MBA not in any of the top 3 or without
a scholarship as shit. I don't consider the career.

maybe... <!-- try to evaluate a MC without scholarship and  -->

**Impact based**

I don't think I can already start working in an EAO as I might need
some special skills, or do other things to get attention of people in
the community before I apply for a job, but never the less, based on

>Earlier we saw the example of Kate, who went to work at a
>non-profit. Not only do non-profit jobs often build your skills more
>slowly, they’re also less flexible. It’s widely accepted in the
>non-profit sector that it’s easier to switch from a business job to a
>non-profit job than vice versa. So if you’re unsure between the two,
>a business position offers more flexibility.

**Best choice overall**

DS in the beginning and moving to opportunities in DW seems to be the
best option with decent CC ([4/5](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) according to 80k) and decent
possibilities to DW ([3/5](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) according to 80k). However, because of
the skills, I see decent chances of moving to an EAO in some
years. There by gaining sufficient flexible CC and capabilities and
credentials to move to be worthy of a top EAO. 

By this I mean for the next 5 years, I will work my ass off and
understand and build my skills in programming and statistics and
writing. This will allow me to improve my scene in the 80k community
and join as an analyst, or writer, researcher based on DATA. Critical
thinking is the main think, solving problems is the other part of it. 

At this point I say, why won't I be offered a job in EAO, taking into
account why I am doing what I doing.

#### Elimination of the obvious

I have the numbers that I need and can already make a decision. Just
choose the highest number and I should be good right? Well there is
uncertainity in the numbers and I want to take it slow and start by
first removing the obvious ones based on reasoning and looking at the
numbers.

**CC wise**

DE for DW is a no go, has the lowest cc rating. One can argue that
once you get into and EAO, you will do great things and with the time
that DE in NL offers I can pretty much build whatever skill I want.

The point is the EAO's primarily require organizational capabilities,
research capabilities, writing capabilities, DS, programming, as far
as I know. But DE seems to offer none of this. Staying in DE and
becoming great at it and moving to a start up can be an option, but we
know how low probability that is.

<!-- What do EAO's actually require skills wise -->

So over all, for the above reasons it seems like a weak choice, but an
obvious other option is to do DS instead and it seems to beat the DE
for DW instantly as it gives you several opportunities to become
capable for EAO, wiht programming and statistics info. Everything
thing that you do at work, is counting towards the 10k-hours-rule
unlike in DE where the work at an EAO is almost orthogonal.

**Support conditions wise**

SC wise it appears that IB is a sure reject. I am really afraid of the
long hours and the tales of horror, lack of excitement in job. Which
is why I think it is a poor fit SC wise even for me. SC, I
gather/understand/guess that it is better even with MC. With hours
being reasonable.

**Impact**

I think it is fair to eliminate Econ Phd with rare chance. Based on my
calculation the number of lives saved isn't as much as working in MC
for 5 years and then leaving

**Total wise**

An Econ Phd can contribute moderately towards impact using ETG and
Advocacy. But, the one that has most impact is when an Econ Phd can
just save too many lives by being at the right place and at the right
moment. The thing is people look at Econ people with respect regarding
things they say, and this makes them very valuable in the field of
policy. 

An Econ PhD however with such a chance of getting this opportunity of
potentially adding benefits to a few millions of lives seems mighty
low as factored in the profile on Econ PhD. To add further, the
estimated impact was calculated to be lesser than EAO impact. Based on
my source who is an Econ PhD from the top 5 universities and got a job
in the government, I think it is wise to let this rare chance in
combination with an Econ PhD slide. 

Despite with the scope of causing maximum impact ever, the chances of
succeeding are really really low for now. 

However, in the later stages of my life working for a startup or
co-founding a startup should definitely be considered, considering the
impact. With a year or 2 of effort, we can better estimate the success
of the startup (say you get accepted into Ycombinator). Even to
attempt startups I need some proper CC, having worked a few years,
which I can use to add value.

<!-- I am afraid that I give more probability to something that is far
--> <!-- away, I seem to be more optimistic about scenario that is -->
<!-- more far away-->

As a sanity check, all the ones eliminated until now, seem to be on
the bottom of the list, when organized based on the total awarded to
each independent career path.

#### Comparing EAO vs DS

Comparing working now at an EAO and taking up DS now, I interpret the
advice from 80k as 'take up DS now'.

> If you are still early in your career, then it’s best to place greater
> importance on career capital than on role impact, as you’re likely to
> be able to find plenty of good opportunities to invest in yourself. If

> and more on making an impact now. That said, the amount of weight to

I anyways need skills, which I need to spend time on. By the looks of
it, statistics, organizational etc... Maybe it may workout that after
one year I should move to EAO. But for now, I don't think EAO is the
right place for me yet.

The CC at an EAO is not really great with respect to getting training
or assistance from experienced people. The DS track followed by
working at an EAO at some point in life seems better than the EAO
track right away based on the advice of 80k-hours.

#### Comparing Econ Phd without the rare chance vs DS

An Econ Phd although hyped greatly by 80k-hours due to its advocacy
potential and possible impact and CC, it still seems to be a not so
great fit. Impact wise I claim an Econ Phd without the rare chance can
save 550 lives @ 29% personal fit. Where as a job at an EAO can save
>970 lives @ 41% personal fit.

It appears that EAO is the place to be and not an Econ PhD. As seen
above though, we want to start with something else (say DS) before we
move to an EAO. By extension then 'DS for DW' beats Econ PhD. 

#### DS vs MC (becoming partner)

MC along with becoming a partner is an incredible opportunity for
ETG. However the personal fit of 1.3% is really low for something with
a potential to save >1200 lives over ones life time. It appears that
it would be better to bet on EAO instead. As the >1200 lives is
dependent on several stages of the career over the next 25 years. It's
not like you can work it out a little and figure out much better
estimates of the personal fit. A personal fit of of 57% is required
for it to match the 'total' of a job at an EAO. With 1 years effort I
can know if I got scholarship in top 20. I would still be at a
personal fit of 25% and far from competing with 'working at an EAO'.

Although an MC is great in CC, I am not sure how it translates when I
would like to work for an EAO. In any case based on the personal fit
(i.e., probability of success) a DS would still beat an MC as the
number of lives saved has been assumed to be the same when working at
an EAO. 

At this moment it appears that MC of any form is not favourable even
with a few years of going further with the career due to the large
uncertainity and seemingly better option of 'DS for DW'. And as said
earlier, even if I spent time to see how far I get with 

So becoming partner is far fetched. Even if I went as far as finishing
my MBA successfully, my other options now are to work for some
organization (with an impact of 700 lives) or join an EAO (with an
impact of >970 lives). I am not sure why I would go with any of these
two options as DS with an EAO track seems more possible with similar
impact levels. 

There by it appears that MC is not worth pursuing just for the CC
alone, as impact estimated along with the personal fit, can be
obtained by other means with much more confidence.

#### Eliminating 

Having eliminated Starting up, Econ Phd with rare chance and IB, I see
that MC all variations of an MC career at low in the table.

This I think is mainly due to the personal fit. For example, becoming
a partner at a top agency is going to be really hard, even for the top
brains, and I estimated that probability to be 1%. Even if you save
1000 lives, it is still not the right move for you, as the net result
is looked at `0.01x1000=10 lives`

Getting an MC is so hard already that the even if there are back up
options, the personal fit is still low. This does not make any more
sense and hence until the personal fit is revised this does not seem
to make sense.

## What is needed?

Up until now, we have seen about the different careers that I can take
up. With this section I want to investigate what problems are there
and what is actually needed for the EA community and how we can be of
assistance.

So are there problems that "I" could take on if I got some special
skill?

What do the other important problems need?

Can I get them by working in DS or MC?

### What do the other important problems need?

[Here](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/) we have a ranking of the different problems by
80k-hours-guide. I first looked at the recommended ones:

- Positively shaping AI
- Promoting Effective Altruism
- Global priorities research
- Institutional decision making

**Positively shaping AI**

Google Deepmind, OpenAI are some projects that I could get into with
knowledge of writing software. I would imagine a 5 year period to get
up to speed if this is the direction I should be going into. I suspect
DS would be a decent start or maybe even just simply software, if
there is some statistics involved. DS seems to allow me to work on
Machine Learning, so I am inclined to be in this realm of DS.

There are organizational roles available like project manager
etc... Some involving managing and writing grants to ensure funding.

There are lot of organizations, which work on it as given [in the
80k-hours-guide](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/#what-can-you-do-to-help).

Funding is alright with this, but it is primarily talent
constrained. So not really for ETG.

> accounting.

As per the estimation of lives saved in EAOs, most jobs in EAOS
should give you a lot of impact, in the order of 1000 lives. Joining
DS or SE can allow to work in the technical side. Joining MC can
possibly give me scope to work in other managerial roles. 

**Note to self**: From time to time I should also try to apply for
jobs directly, based on things like this I hear:

>You should apply if you are a software engineer who is fairly
>comfortable with linear algebra, basic statistics, and the basics of
>stochastic gradient descent. Experience in machine learning is a
>bonus. You are not expected to have mastery of deep learning — the
>problems we pursue are always at the edge of the state of the art,
>which means that nobody's an expert.


**Promoting effective Altruism**

<!-- What I can do -->
What I can do is work for EAOs, ETG, founding new organizations as
needed, and make connections to my field of expertise and the EA
community.

<!-- Where I can work -->
Organizations such as CEA, 80k-hours and Founders pledge do exactly
that. These type of organizations route funding to the best regions
and are in control of growing and strengthening the movement.

<!-- Can DS and MC get me there? -->

DS can help me in research or getting analyst positions. I am not
fully sure if MC can get me these type of jobs. <!-- ask ram -->

**Global priorities research**


<!-- What is needed and what I can do -->

> Researchers trained in economics, mathematics, or philosophy to
> develop the methodology for setting global priorities.  Researchers
> trained in social and natural sciences with the ability to collect
> data and analyse specific global problems.


<!-- Where can I work -->

Join the Global Priorities institute in a research position or support
with managerial positions. 

<!-- Can DS and MC get me there -->

For GPI, a firm no. They need Economists of any level.

For FHI, they need project managers who can lead certain
movements. This could be possible with an MC? <!-- Ask ram -->

So MC probably, and DS not!

<!-- Could be also possible with DS to get into it in AI related tasks -->
<!-- within FHI. But this has nothing to do with Global Priorities -->
<!-- research I think, this is just advancing AI research. -->

**Improving institutional decision making**

<!-- What is needed -->

getting a position in behavorial science/research lab, doing
fundamental research, fostering adoption of proven techniques,
directing more funding towards this research.

This seems to be one research area that is funding restricted and 80k
hours suggests the need to become program managers in various places
who can divert funding to these places or this research.


<!-- Where can I work -->

There are some places

<!-- Can DS or MC get me there -->

It looks like DS or MC might not be able to get me there. Somehow
behavioural/ decision science PhD would help.

Seems very much not for me, except for trying to be a program
manager. And I think it is also hard to become a program
manager. 

To be noted is that this is possibly quite neglected in terms of
funding and research and fostering the best practices where it matters.




Let me join DS for now, over the next 6 months I will again evaluate
what I need to do, There are so many options, I need to spend a lot of
time on this. It looks like MC or DS will give me CC and I can fine
tune my path to create large impact.

MC is hard to get, DS is relatively my personal fit. If nothing works
out in the next few years (I will also do an internship for any EAO
from here), and then apply for an MBA and go from there on.
