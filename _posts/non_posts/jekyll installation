https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34521806/installing-jekyll-on-ubuntu-14-04/34523631#34523631

shows how to install if we get the error:

ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.



## Finally

use this for the best installation

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34521806/installing-jekyll-on-ubuntu-14-04/34523631#34523631

installed bundler separately!

## Finally

git init

git remote add orgin url

git push remote origin

git branch /-a/-r for see which branches you have

Right now the setup is not complete as master local is still light!

git checkout master
git fetch remote
git reset --hard remote/master
