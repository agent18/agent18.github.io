## Goal

To know more about profiles of people who have an MBA for example in
RSM. and people with scholarship. and also other schools?

## Introducation

### Her

You have been in marketting, always an outstanding profile, cum laude
and now scholarship to NewYork.

### ME

- Been an engineer in Holland in startup
- Not much scope to grow or do other things. Learning very specific
  things, not sure it is good in the long run! Experience does not
  make you more worthy essentially

#### Where I see myself

Be worthy to lead within NGO's such as '80000 hrs', 'Centre for
effective Altruism', 'Founders Pledge', 'GiveWell' etc...

#### Why MBA
- MBA is my outlet to open avenues to do other things
- Gaining flexible career capital if you will
- Scope to move to the US, UK or other parts of the world.

In the near run I see myself either working in Management Consulting
or IB. But for now I am not too worried or bothered about exactly what
to do. I see the possibilities are aplenty.

#### Why scholarship

- No money
- I want to really step up for the future

#### My goals in a the next 10 years

Gaining flexible career capital if you will!

Also gain credibility to move to UK, US or wihtin europe to make
