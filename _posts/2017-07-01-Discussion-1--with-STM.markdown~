Today there will be a discssion with my friend and I would like to take a  moment and write it down here to help with the discussion.

#### EA - anamoly | Determining the Value system 

I wrote a [post on the purpose of life][EA] a few months back, where I talk about Peter Singer and how tries telling people to use feelings at one time and then to use the head the other time. What he doesn't tell is how to differentiate when to use the head and not.

The bigger question as a result is "What is the true Value System?". I have not gatherered the means to do that yet.

#### If EA, then pay?

Peter Singer suggests to pay atleast 10% of your income for worthy causes. For example, one could pay Give Well organization which has tried to rate different organizations based on their effectiveness.
