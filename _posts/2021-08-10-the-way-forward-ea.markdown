## Rant

An STM is saying to quit this EA lifestyle

Sjir says maybe he should not even encourage me, fucker!

But here I am like, but the calculations?

**Time left**

I have about 4 hrs today, 

~~4~~, 4, 4, 4, 2, 6, 6 = 30 hrs in total

1. write EA lifetime impact first (8 hrs + 4 hrs to write)

2. Write Data Science lifetime impact (8 hrs + 4 hrs to write), 

Main issue is the explanation of impact

Should I calculate present value?

doing decision tree a bit easier? how do I make it easier

**ram**
1. While making lifetime earning calculations should you use PV?
2. Would you take today's value?
3. How do you know discount rate?


## TODO

0. focus on the most sensitive aspects?
1. Re-do estimates for Data Science (final value and the other
   estimates)
2. Redo estimates for EA life and post on EA forath?
3. Actions to take for Data Science career? (oh my god! the implications)

3. simplify the use of decision trees, there should be a faster way to
   calculate?
