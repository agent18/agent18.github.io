## Past is past

Today is Jan 17, over the last few weeks, (7 weeks), I was on vacation and sick
or just sick. I am back now. Don't want to stall further my progress. Don't want
to think that I have wasted so many days, so wasting one more day cannot do any
harm. I don't want to think of the past, I want to rock the future. 

## Setting the order of the day

I will "work" 2 hrs every day. In case I forsee some event, I am allowed to
pre-work this 2 hrs as I like for a rainy day. I have missed the monday and
tuesday, but that's ok. I will move on, leave the past and focus on the
future. And to that I raise my glass to a 30 day continuous "work-fest" of 2 hrs
a day. The only exclusion from doing it would be to if I am sick or some other
unforseeable event takes place in life (I leave it to the users moral values to
be the judge of it). I only say 2 hrs and not give what I have to do, as I see
that I have failed in the past with the schemes I proposed. Well, I didn't write
my learnings from them as well. I will adhoc come up with challenges as and when
necessary. 

The reader is warned that there used to be a time when the same thigns was
happening and the reader struggled big time to clock the 2 hrs. But well, that
was before the whole motivation speech. Anyways, enough of this shit. Lets gets
the day staaaaarted,.... waaat!

For the weak days...
You have 1 hr since the time you arrive to start work. No distractions are
permitted once work has begun (including unecessary mail checking or phone
checking), excluding the 10 min break in between. By 10 I mean 10.

For the wek ends..
On saturday this shall be worked begin before noon) and be done.

On sunday I will work for 1 hr only. Its fine. 

I will log the amount of work done everyday. cheers! No crime for forgetting but
lets not.

In addition to go with this. I will do cardio every day bro. and workout for 4-5
days a week. In case of injuries I am permitted leave from working out. but not
cardio. 

> dont look at the past and feel bad that you have hardly improved, brood over
> that you suck (Well yes you do), but I know a way out of hell... If I do the
> next 3 months properly, All the past shit will not matter, 

All problems shall be fixed after or before clocking the 2 hrs. Cannot be
substituted for real work. 

This is the plan for the next 30 days.

The internet issue needs to be fixed. well? I allow this exception.
	
## History

This career series of posts was written with the idea of helping me understand what I
needed to do w.r.t my career and how to get there. As it has been a while (4
weeks), I would like to re-boot my system. The primary goal that is expected to
drive all change and actions in my life is based of this [Answers](/Answers-finale.html) post.

So in [Career-1][Career-1] we saw about some basics and the career data I
have. In the following post [Dream Job][Career-2], we discussed what should be
there in a dream job, such as flow, moderate amount of stress. This post has a
synopsis of the research on stress and my final understanding. It's a good post
I will keep it for now as it contains quite some intersting things  about long
hours, stress and vacation. As the post says, its everything about how a job
should be and what it should have, what  I should look at in a job.

[Post 3][career-3] seems to be a post that can be skipped. I suspect it was a
post written for completeness. Then maybe it can stay. 

>There’s no reason to be embarrassed by this fact, but it does emphasize how
>important it is to consider how you can use your good fortune to help
>others. In a more equal and intuitive world, we could just focus on helping
>those around us, and making our own lives go well. But it turns out we have an
>enormous opportunity to help other people with little cost to ourselves – and
>it would be a terrible shame to squander it.

In [Post-4][career-4] we discuss where we need to focus and what we can do to
maximize our impact. There are several areas and several things that we could
do. With this post is quite clear that there are several opportunities, and a
proper analysis needs to be made so that we can start in this direction over the
next year. 

In [Post-5][career-5] we discuss about how the suggestion of [80k
hours][80k-uur] is to start with direct work if possible rather than earning to
give. As it is not a shortage of funds that is the major problem but the using
of the funds in an effective way or channelling funds to the right medium to
create large/right impact.

All these posts are written not with a proper beginning or end. So I guess I
shall keep them and proceed further. I think what would be best now is to do
profiling of different fields, how I can get into that field, my key
uncertainities and what could be the impact. This is going to be a highly experimental
post. The main problem with this post is going to be the uncertainity. Its gonna
be cray cray cray.

Before that I also quickly make a synopsis of the 80k hours links... 



### Direct work vs indirect work (earning to give)

>80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should earn to give
>long term.  
>we think that most people should be doing things like politics,
>policy, high-value research, for-profit and non-profit entrepreneurship, and
>direct work for highly socially valuable organizations. [^2]

### Choosing an area to focus

Work on neglected, solvable, personal-fit-making-sense, expertise-making-sense
type of problems. [^3]

### Best approaches Which jobs are good/great?

- Earning to give
- Advocacy
- Research
- Direct work

[80k hours high impact jobs](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/) suggest the following as the different ways to contribute

[This post][contributing-directly] written by me briefly discusses the actions suggested
in [80k hours high impact jobs](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/). The outcome seems to me that that

1. either we become mathematicians, staticians or economicians
(preferably Phd's)

2. Develop generic career capital involving leadership (founding),
   management abilities (fundraising large sums of money within
   bureaucracies) 

3. Getting into policy making, shaping type of roles; Grant maker

4. Earning to give is always an option, but first we need to see what
   we can do directly. 

[contributing-directly]: /career(5).html

The [Career quiz](https://80000hours.org/career-quiz/#/) suggest me the [following based on my answers](https://80000hours.org/career-quiz/#/quantitative=yes&verbalAndSocial=yes&riskTolerance=no&challengeTolerance=yes&careerStage=early&pathType=directImpact%252C+advocacy%252C+earningToGive%252C+research):

- Management consulting
- Working at effective non-profits
- Product manager at Tech
- Data Science ( for skill-building & earning to give)
- Economics phd
- Software engineering at large tech-firms
- Machine learning phdg

 

### Career Capital

80k hrs is very clear that we should look for opportunities of direct
impact rather than earning to give, to begin with.


People peak after 10 to 20 years of experience. Being successful takes
time. Invest in your now for a better impact tomorrow.

I read the story about Tara and constantly think that I am not that
high acheiver, what ever they touch which turns to gold. But thats
ok. thigns take time, and I am going to be that acheiver. Let's
already start learnign something. I am spending too much time just
doing nothing.

### summary

Moreover, if you focus on the approaches that are best suited to the
problems you want to solve and where you have the best personal fit,
you can do even more good again. And you can do this while having a
more satisfying career too.


#### things i could do

1. Plan a career in managing founding companies.

My friend in holland does things like this. Once he hits his success,
I will get involved with him. Even for earning-to-give, founding and
making money seems to be an option. He has soms contacts in india, who
I should meet just to get an idea of what would be possible, if I can
start as an apprentice/mentee to someone killing it in business.

2. Data science
3. Economics degree and then normal job

Taking a normal job after such a jump seems pointless. As DS seems to
be much more viable option withe more money in it.

4. Economics degree and then a job in the NGO's This makes
sense. Seems to be the need of the hour for the NGO's

5. My current job as an engineer in the precision industry.  Not sure
about the career capital I have earned and how it will be useful in
non-research based precision industries.  More over the growth in this
part of the country seems really slow. For example, someone I know
working in paypal, got an untimely bonus of 10k$. What! Doens't happen
ever in holland.

At the very least need to look at gaining diff career capital and
moving to the US

6. Other options could be to do an MBA/finance degree and try getting
   into Dubai

I have heard stories where people did philosophy phd and who started
working in a finance firm donating about a 6 figure salary. So it
would be wise to check out their careers or rather what such a career
would need.

7. Programming

Something the idea of which feels so awesome. I would love to get into
it, but only if this makes sense impact wise.

Don't know how acheivable such a position is especially considering
the over crowded and heavy competition for a job.

Done above

>Decide which two to five problems you think are most pressing.  Find
the relevant problem profiles, read the list of career ideas in each
profile, and note any that could be a good fit for you.

With Global prio research, careers in research, mathematics and
economics seem what is needed. I suppose I could get into each of
those, but of course the chance of success and that I am already 26
need to be taken into account. Same with AI and health in poor
countries. I have listed some of the profiles I could be doing above.

>Go through the four approaches we covered in this chapter, and list
out any other options that could be a good fit for you.  The aim at
this point is just to come up with more options. We’ll explain how to
further narrow down in an upcoming article.



### Reflection and rant

I am just writing and writing and writing. What is the fucking
point. What I want to do is to know reliably what I need to do. The
approach on a high level seems alright, but I need to spend time
understanding things and classifying thigs. Once I understand the
problems or note what each problem needs, I should take a step bakc
and evaluate what I can do with specific career options. Maybe I can't
get far, but that is what the other parts of the essay are. Right now
see your pitfall and see how you can move from there.

Once again, the goal is to first see the topics and what they
need. How to get there according to 80k and from there on the
feasibility and impact. This was good.

How I will go about the feasibility and impact is fully not
clear. That is why I guess I am looking at the impact and induvidual
profiles to see if it is going to suit me or not.

Another thing I noticed is that I am doing too much, writing and
reading. The task is too tough right now. I also see a certain flow. I
was able t work 3 hrs straight, which is pretty decent for my stds. I
have never really worked so much. I should look to cash in on this
type of work. Come early and start early is the key.No pressure. I
want to get work done. There is so much of unknown and so much work to
do.

In the sprit of deal that I made, I want to reduce the deal such that
I do lesser words when I am having to do research. and also reading
10k is almost impossible and leads stright to failure. However, 6k
seeems possible.  In the sprit of the deal, I aproove of these choices
as I have clocked good hours.

Another thing I should probably consider is about writing well.


My grade of 7.5/10 for my master thesis is not representative of the
work I put in or the success of my project. The research direction
didn't come from me, as I barely had experience in it. I trusted the
faculty to give me a good assignment. Unfortunately, it was more about
taking an idea and implementing it to see if it works. Went quite deep
into linear algebra. I did a lot of coding, and read a lot of
papers. Did everything I could with my time to solve the issue. I
dived heavily into the theory, but unfortunately, I didn't think of
some fundamental things that questioned the need of my research or the
use of it. My goal was not to do research unfortunately, my goal was
to learn from the best and learn as much as I could. I spent several
hours a day working on python, I spent several months understanding
the fundamentals and why things came about. But I do think I am work
slow (citation needed, compared to what?)

My point is I learn quick, I work hard when I have a personal stake in
the situation. I am sure I can step up and with long time spent on it
I can definitely kill. Every extra hour I spend at work would mean
more impact and that would be life, essentially. So great.

My current boss thinks I work fast, I pick up things quickly. He
didn't expect me to finish the project I had started at the beginning
of the job within one month, but guess what. I stepped in for several
projects and delivered results according to him at pretty good
speed. From knowing nothing in a project, I have delivered, and I
continue to deliver, its everyday bro.



An idea could be during the month that I am in india, I could do a
course in economics and a course in data science. I am quite inclined
to do these as it would free me from the burden of writing. and I
honestly wouldn't mind working on these for 4 hrs a day even. Have
some pretty decent deadlines and in those 36 days actually crack
something.


So, early career, the ideal is to find a job that offers both impact
and career capital, but if forced to choose between the two, lean
towards career capital.

This doesn’t mean ignoring social impact – it’s best to stay involved
through volunteering, conferences, donating 1-10%, and so on, so you
stay motivated and keep learning. And if you come across an especially
good opportunity for impact, then it might be better to focus on
that. Rather, the question is where to put your focus most of the
time.

And thats why we move on to Career capital

Sales and marketting at ASML?

Investment banking

 If you have relatively good quantitative skills, then consider sales
 and trading or asset management in investment banking.

#### Applying to your career

>Go over all the four paths to career capital and ways to gain career
>capital in any job, and note down three new ways you could gain
>career capital.


>Can you work at a high-performance, growing organization?

Not sure what is meant by high-performance. One of my friends works in
Portugal, in a DS company. The company is growing, as in hiring new
people to start branches in other parts of the world. People usually
clock 12 hrs per day I heard. Seems to be a high-performance, growing
organization. Another company which is into aerospace consulting,
which has very few people is growing and expanding in a variety of
regions in the world.

Considering the above examples, I am not sure I have the chance to
gain career capital in a highperformance organization. My current work
is in a startup, which will either be worth billions in 2 years or not
at all. There is no high performance. Everyone is relaxed, atleast in
my team. It feels like a government company. I spend a good amount of
time doing manual labour to collect data, than actually doing some
high-level thinking. This seems to be a flag, that I should watch out
for, considering I am in my prime and don't want to be part of simple
stuff. Although, they are giving me more responsibility with
milestones which is making me work harder.

>Do you have a good option for graduate study?

Maybe.  I am referring to doing a Masters. I have already done a
masters in TU Delft, in precision engineering. if I need to move to
DS, it might be worth considering to do a masters in the US.

>Can you do something that will teach you a valuable skill?

I could do some courses online in CS, DS, and Economics. Doing courses
in DS seem to be a nice way to start in other companies.  Same as CS I
guess. I have read in the DS profile regarding just a course being
enough to start at a DS company.

It could be an option to also look at marketing and sales.

Being social is something I want to be more good at. With women I find
it especially hard to make conversations, unless I am inebriated. As I
look at the 80k-org website, I get the impression that this (being
social) could also help. Keep and maintain contacts.

Maybe I could join the event organizing team in my company, or join
some group outside to spurr more social moving.

>Is there an option where you’ll achieve something impressive,
>especially if relevant to social impact?

Nope.


>What’s the most valuable career capital you already have? Identifying
your most valuable career capital can give you clues about what you’ll
be best at, and help you to convince employers to hire you. Review
each of the categories: Skills, which you can break down into (i)
transferable skills, (ii) knowledge, and (iii) personality traits,

i) Transferable skills: ability to solve problems of all sorts, some
trouble shooting experience and giving support to other
organizations. Programming skills from 7months of python, some
leadership skills from being the chairman of the student board, design
for better assembly and function skills, ability to work on unknown
problems and come up to speed asap.

ii) knowledge

Design, dynamics, mechanical engineering basically, FEM, programming,

iii)

Social, Leadership (sometimes), obsession over problem at work,
punctual, Determination and persistance, Eager and willing to add to
my base skills, ability to co-work well. My co-workers like working
with me.


Connections

I know almost all the professors in my department really well. Some of
them are famous for their work in their respective fields. I know a
big guy in Denso Germany, who got me an interview last time, very
friendly guy. And some others in my field and my peers. I worked at a
startup and know these people quite well. I know my CTO quite well. I
am currently discussing with him regarding my milestone for the
company. In india I am still connected to my professors from IIT. I
know some startup guys from the my time studying gate and being in
IIT.

Credentials: I am a masters degree holder, with a gate rank of 1061
(98.96 percentile), in one of the popular universities in the world.

Acheivements?

Runway:

I have runway for about 6 months and the rest I am using to pay my
loan back to my parents. I can store or generate more runway, as
required. Although if I needed to take 2 years off, I
