## Past is past

Today is Jan 17, over the last few weeks, (7 weeks), I was on vacation and sick
or just sick. I am back now. Don't want to stall further my progress. Don't want
to think that I have wasted so many days, so wasting one more day cannot do any
harm. I don't want to think of the past, I want to rock the future. 

## Setting the order of the day

I will "work" 2 hrs every day. In case I forsee some event, I am allowed to
pre-work this 2 hrs as I like for a rainy day. I have missed the monday and
tuesday, but that's ok. I will move on, leave the past and focus on the
future. And to that I raise my glass to a 30 day continuous "work-fest" of 2 hrs
a day. The only exclusion from doing it would be to if I am sick or some other
unforseeable event takes place in life (I leave it to the users moral values to
be the judge of it). I only say 2 hrs and not give what I have to do, as I see
that I have failed in the past with the schemes I proposed. Well, I didn't write
my learnings from them as well. I will adhoc come up with challenges as and when
necessary. 

The reader is warned that there used to be a time when the same thigns was
happening and the reader struggled big time to clock the 2 hrs. But well, that
was before the whole motivation speech. Anyways, enough of this shit. Lets gets
the day staaaaarted,.... waaat!

For the weak days...
You have 1 hr since the time you arrive to start work. No distractions are
permitted once work has begun (including unecessary mail checking or phone
checking), excluding the 10 min break in between. By 10 I mean 10.

For the wek ends..
On saturday this shall be worked begin before noon) and be done.

On sunday I will work for 1 hr only. Its fine. 

I will log the amount of work done everyday. cheers! No crime for forgetting but
lets not.

In addition to go with this. I will do cardio every day bro. and workout for 4-5
days a week. In case of injuries I am permitted leave from working out. but not
cardio. 

> dont look at the past and feel bad that you have hardly improved, brood over
> that you suck (Well yes you do), but I know a way out of hell... If I do the

All problems shall be fixed after or before clocking the 2 hrs. Cannot be
substituted for real work. 

This is the plan for the next 30 days.

The internet issue needs to be fixed. well? I allow this exception.
	
## History

This career series of posts was written with the idea of helping me understand what I
needed to do w.r.t my career and how to get there. As it has been a while (4
weeks), I would like to re-boot my system. The primary goal that is expected to
drive all change and actions in my life is based of this [Answers](/Answers-finale.html) post.

So in [Career-1][Career-1] we saw about some basics and the career data I
have. In the following post [Dream Job][Career-2], we discussed what should be
there in a dream job, such as flow, moderate amount of stress. This post has a
synopsis of the research on stress and my final understanding. It's a good post
I will keep it for now as it contains quite some intersting things  about long
hours, stress and vacation. As the post says, its everything about how a job
should be and what it should have, what  I should look at in a job.

[Post 3][career-3] seems to be a post that can be skipped. I suspect it was a
post written for completeness. Then maybe it can stay. 

>There’s no reason to be embarrassed by this fact, but it does emphasize how
>important it is to consider how you can use your good fortune to help
>others. In a more equal and intuitive world, we could just focus on helping
>those around us, and making our own lives go well. But it turns out we have an
>enormous opportunity to help other people with little cost to ourselves – and
>it would be a terrible shame to squander it.

In [Post-4][career-4] we discuss where we need to focus and what we can do to
maximize our impact. There are several areas and several things that we could
do. With this post is quite clear that there are several opportunities, and a
proper analysis needs to be made so that we can start in this direction over the
next year. 

In [Post-5][career-5] we discuss about how the suggestion of [80k
hours][80k-uur] is to start with direct work if possible rather than earning to
give. As it is not a shortage of funds that is the major problem but the using
of the funds in an effective way or channelling funds to the right medium to
create large/right impact.

All these posts are written not with a proper beginning or end. So I guess I
shall keep them and proceed further. I think what would be best now is to do
profiling of different fields, how I can get into that field, my key
uncertainities and what could be the impact. This is going to be a highly experimental
post. The main problem with this post is going to be the uncertainity. Its gonna
be cray cray cray.

Before that I also quickly make a synopsis of the 80k hours links... 



### Direct work vs indirect work (earning to give)

>80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should earn to give
>long term.  
>we think that most people should be doing things like politics,
>policy, high-value research, for-profit and non-profit entrepreneurship, and
>direct work for highly socially valuable organizations. [^2]

### Choosing an area to focus

Work on neglected, solvable, personal-fit-making-sense, expertise-making-sense
type of problems. [^3]

### Best approaches Which jobs are good/great?

- Earning to give
- Advocacy
- Research
- Direct work

[80k hours high impact jobs](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/) suggest the following as the different ways to contribute

[This post][contributing-directly] written by me briefly discusses the actions suggested
in [80k hours high impact jobs](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/). The outcome seems to me that that

1. either we become mathematicians, staticians or economicians
(preferably Phd's)

2. Develop generic career capital involving leadership (founding),
   management abilities (fundraising large sums of money within
   bureaucracies) 

3. Getting into policy making, shaping type of roles; Grant maker

4. Earning to give is always an option, but first we need to see what
   we can do directly.

The [Career quiz](https://80000hours.org/career-quiz/#/) suggest me the [following based on my answers](https://80000hours.org/career-quiz/#/quantitative=yes&verbalAndSocial=yes&riskTolerance=no&challengeTolerance=yes&careerStage=early&pathType=directImpact%252C+advocacy%252C+earningToGive%252C+research):

- Management consulting
- Working at effective non-profits
- Product manager at Tech
- Data Science ( for skill-building & earning to give)
- Economics phd
- Software engineering at large tech-firms
- Machine learning phdg

 

### Career Capital

80k hrs is very clear that we should look for opportunities of direct
impact rather than earning to give, to begin with.


People peak after 10 to 20 years of experience. Being successful takes
time. Invest in your now for a better impact tomorrow.

I read the story about Tara and constantly think that I am not that
high acheiver, what ever they touch which turns to gold. But thats
ok. thigns take time, and I am going to be that acheiver. Let's
already start learnign something. I am spending too much time just
doing nothing.

#### Work at a growing organisation that has a reputation for high performance


The skill consulting/management seems to give you!
