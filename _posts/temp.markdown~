## Great cities attract ambitious people



## Persuasion 

~~## The city sends you a message 
~~
~~That is if you are around somehow it could influence you?
~~
~~## It matters a lot, the message that the city sends
~~
## Industries cluster in certain areas

If you look at the Youtube scene or entertainers scene, apparently
3/4th of the US entertainers live in LA. A complete building [which
housed mostly Vinestars who moved into that complex in LA (back in
2014)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/hype-house-and-the-la-tiktok-mansion-gold-rush/articleshow/73131333.cms). A quick search on some of the top youtubers and where they
are now and where they were before reveals a trend that all these guys
moved to LA to "further their career". David Dobrik after graduating
high school moved to LA from Illinois to pursue his Vine career. Liza
Koshy moved from Houston to LA. King Bach from Toronto (moved to
different cities in US), Logan Paul from Ohio, Jake Paul from Ohio,
Amanda Cerny from Pennyslvania, all are some of the top youtubers and
live in LA and move to LA (I guess to further their career). If you
look at the career of Lily Singh (Superwoman), who moved in December
2015 to LA all the way from Toronto, we can guess why. Lily Singh is
now the first woman late night talk show host in 2019. Often times
(enough to remember) I have seen Logan Paul ask people to move to
LA. He did that to his x-roommate Mark Dohner, his current roomates
Mike Majlak and Evan. Somehow that seems to be where shit is going
down, according to them.

Most HOT and happening talk shows are recorded here in
California. "The Late Late show with James Corden", "Jimmy Kimmerl
Live", "Conan" all in or aound 20 mins from California. Why do they all have to
be this close? No idea. Maybe it is where people come to look for this type
of work, or maybe the people who are interviewed in these shows are
easier to reach, whatever. But somehow they seem to want to flock
together.

It's wierd and maybe not at the same time that "Last week tonight",
"the daily show with Trevor Noah", "The late show with Stephen
Colbert", and you can almost guess that the "Saturday Night Live"
would also be taped in NYC. Why NYC? maybe the audience that they
want, maybe the resources that they want are available there. Not
surprisingly all these shows are politically charged. What we saw
earlier was just shows which involved celebrities.

Somehow, Florence has been producing the most important works of art
consistently over 3 centuries despite Milan also being from Italy and
just as big and 350 km apart.

Great cities such as florence (art capital), seems to somehow be
sending the message that Art is important and people seem to be taking
to it, working on it, and sort of putting it ahead. Maybe they have
the resources needed to learn the art. Maybe they have the network
which allows to grow in that field. These are all speculations and
nevertheless, there seems to be something about living in the city
that increases your chances of producing some high quality art.

If you look at New York, it appears that it is the "Investment capital
of the world". New York is where the [Largest revenue investment
banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_investment_banks) are. Many big banks have their HQ there (Goldman Sachs, JP
Morgan and Chase, Morgan Stanley, BofA) for example. Yes there are
other "Large" banks Barclays Investment Bank, whose headquarters are in
London. A quick look into their revenue dwarfs in comparison to the
Goldman Sachs for example. I am not saying the reason why they "suck"
is because of their location. But the fact that they are not totally
big and not in New York isn't helping its case here.

The Tech giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google, UBER, Lyft, Nvidia,
Intel, Instagram, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Twitter, Netflix, Y-combinator,
Tesla, Airbnb, PayPal, SpaceX, Stripe, Snap, Udacity are all in the
Silicon Valley with their headquarters. Somehow Amazon, Microsoft are
not mainly in Silicon valley. They do have a small presence there. For
example, Microsoft has only 2000 employees out of its 145k employees
in California.

Same story in other regions as well.

I currently live in Delft. When I lost my job in Delft, there were a
number of people contacting me and saying I needed to move to
Eindhoven and sure enough I had most of my interviews there. All the
top companies related to semiconductor industry are clustered around
Eindhoven (for some reason). ASML, Philips, NXP and many contracted
medium sized companies working for them and a gazillion recruitment
agencies working for them. And right now am working in delft and it
appears that the lack of being in Eindhoven is seriously affecting
me. I look at people who go to Eindhoven often or people who are in
Eindhoven getting better responsibilities, knowing about traineeships
through their network etc... I am literally unable to network to find
out opportunities.

Malls Hello? In Forum mall, somehow PUMA, NIKE, Reebok, and Adidas are
literally next to each other. SIDE BY SIDE. Hmm! Same thing with those
shirt brands like Louie Philip, Peter England, Van Heusen. It makes
sense in this case though I guess. I literally went to all the stores
for shopping shoes everytime I need to buy shoes or shirts. I step
foot into all stores. And they are all in the same Mall. Anyways from
a sale perspective lets say it makes money for them. 

In the city where I live, there are three-four Turkish stores in the
same "street", where we get Indian Masalas for example and there is no
more anywhere else in the city. Similarly, the center of the city has
the largest collection of Restaurants (fine dining types).

## Startups should move to Silicon Valley

Based primarily on: http://www.paulgraham.com/startuphubs.html

PG seems to vouch to startups, that they have the best bet of success
even more than in Boston, only when they come to Silicon Valley.

PG says, time and again he has seen VC's in Boston be conservative,
not aggressive with pursuing a funding for a startup. "By the time the
Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already gone. The
way you get big returns is not by trying to avoid losses, but by
trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. And the big hits often
look risky at first."

Facebook was started in Boston. Boston VCs said no and FB moved to
Silicon Valley and raised money there. We all know how much FB is
worth today.

Looking at investment numbers or funding raised according to this
report [here](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/global-tech-hubs/) and [here](https://inspiration2go.de/fileadmin/user_upload/CB-Insights_Global-Tech-Hubs.pdf):

- Cumulative Dollars of funding to Hubs from Jan 2012 - May 20, 2018

	140B<span>$</span> to Silicon Valley
	72B<span>$</span> to Beijing 
	36B<span>$</span> to New York (Boston area)
  	
- Number of rounds with greater than 100M<span>$</span> at Silicon
  Valley
  
	  158 for Silicon Valley
	  40 for New York
	  etc...
	  
Silicon Valley seems far more superior. Yes there are growing areas
which are startup Hubs such as Stockholm, Amsterdam, Tel Aviv, London
etc... but none seem to compare to the "supremacy" of the one and only
Silicon Valley, in terms of Big risk VC's and billions of dollors of
funding.

With some exceptions it is maybe better to move to another area or
stay put such as: if your are in the entertainment startup scene maybe
you might want to be in New York or LA. If you have a good investor
who has committed to fund you, you should probably stay where you are.

Summary being Bold investors are here for you. 

The above seems so great for for-profits. What about the non-profits
though? Will MacAskill, co-founder of 80khours and Centre for
Effective Altruism informs [here](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/), from his experience at
Y-combinator says that, Y-combinator might not be the space for getting
funding.

>80,000 Hours raised a little bit of funding, but didn’t prioritise it
>after Demo Day because the time investment to raise a dollar of
>funding from YC introductions seemed much greater than from other
>funding avenues we had.

But they continue to have a small presence (2 out of 10 people) in
California (Berkeley and San Francisco) working for them while most of
them seem to be in Oxford where they originated from.

80khours and Centre for Effective Altruism went through
Ycombinator. Both are co-founded by the same person Will
MacAskill. [Here](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/) Will writes about if people should go through
Y-combinator. 

Moreover, 80khours doesn't seem to be a startup anymore (a startup has
found a business model and a product that is right for the market, it
stops being a startup and graduates to an enterprise.). 

## Anamolies

The most interesting for me is the EA community. But looking at some
of the "top" EA organizations and where they are seems to be painting
a different picture: 



If there exists such
a community, then I would want to be around there, in search of
opportunities and persuasion.

## 80khours reasons to move because

- 3/4 US entertainers live in LA. 

- The world’s ten largest urban economic regions hold only 6.5% of the
  world’s population, but account for 57% of patented innovations, 53%
  of the most cited scientists and 43% of economic output. This
  suggests that, in terms of innovation and economic output, the
  people in these regions are about eight times more productive than
  the average person.

- They are the most productive

"It seems to suggest you'll be more likely to make a breakthrough if
you move to these regions."

- We’ve certainly advised people who saw major boosts to their careers
  after moving city.
  
- Where you live determines the type of people you'll spend time
  with. It determine your security in retirement. 
  
## Art

It appears that where you live could be quite important atleast in the
beginning and middle years as PG says. He gives examples of how
Florence is the capital for art and not a very similarly large city,
Milan.


## Finance

New York is the banking capital. If you want to do investment banking
that's where you should go. The headquarters of JP morgan and chase,
Goldman Sacks and Morgan Stanley (The top firms in IB) are from New
york. But why! ;). 


## Youtube

A good number of youtubers are found in LA. David Dobrik moved from X
to LA. Logan Paul moved from Ohio to LA. Liza Koshy moved from X to
LA. There are counter examples from UK such as KSI (as big as
LP). 1600 vine is the hottest place where LP Amanda Cerny, King Mach
and many such youtubers lived. I often find in their videos that they
ask people to move to LA. Some examples of such people are Mike Majlak
and Evan and Mark Dohner, all of whom moved to LA upon the advice of
LP. It appears that if you want to be a big internet star you need to
be around there. Maybe its the auditions, the people you meet
etc... Even Lily Singh from Canada moved to LA, to "further her
career". She's a late night host. 

All late late shows seem to be recorded in LA. LA seems to be the
Celibrity, internet capital of the world.

## Silicon Valley

Startup scene is hot in... you guessed it.... 

Somehow similar people need to flock together, despite their
capabilities standing for itself.

## What is persuation

Persuation is real. Then I want to surround myself with opportunities
and people who are like minded. Not fucking Asian Lee who is Bored of
her life and want's to go on vacation and drink all the
time. Jesus. Some useful persuation please. As much as I don't want
the GF thing to rub on me it does rub now and then. Especially in
India. Damn! somany beautis (with whom I supposedly had a shot with)


## EA

Coming to EA, the EA conferences (unsure who all attend), seem to
happen in two locations: SFO and London only. Why I wonder. 

Umm, but scientific discoveries don't seemt to flock regions. Hmmm. 

As PG says, there is a force and you woudn't want to fight such a
force rather, go along with it and use it to further your prospects.

Recently 80khours seems to have moved all the way from Oxford to LA.

My colleargues most of whom are really good at waht they do, go home
and seem to be suggesting that they do something completely different,
like talking to gf or other things.

It appears that I should be in the silicon valley. 80khours moved to SV.

## Examples from current life

Delft vs ASML

Respect of people



## Conclusion

Every area produces a particular kind of people. Florence for example
for artists. Newyork for business men. Not a coincidence that all
banks have their HQ in NewYork. NAC that my friend went to NY to make
money in IB. It's called the New York Stock exchange.

## The Anamolies

What about  universities and acheivements in the field of research,
pretty much it seems to be scattered around.

Silicon valley is the tech hub

people vs region/city

PG wouldn't fight such a force but use it to help himself instead.

Youtubers

So many vacancies in EA Community but not one in San Jose though.

## Persuation 

You know, I was reading today: https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/

"80,000 Hours and the Centre for Effective Altruism are doing well by
non-profit standards. If we surrounded ourselves only with non-profit
people, there would be a temptation to coast.  But at group office
hours, I’d often feel like one of the least competent people in the
room; and the organization I was helping run was doing merely fine by
YC startup standards. This pushed me to work even harder and optimize
my time even further."

This is so exhausting for pandian who works barely 8 hours during the
day goes to gym. Spends time on youtube for an hour after coming
home. So sad, to note what I am today.

Where is the ambition?

where is my persuation?

Maybe you will get shit done once you are being persuaded.???
