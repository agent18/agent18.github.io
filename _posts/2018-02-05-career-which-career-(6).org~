** Goal

I want to create maximum impact over my entire career could be either
by earning to give or by gaining sufficient career captial and using
that to create the max impact.

** History

This career series of posts was written with the idea of helping me
understand what I needed to do w.r.t my career and how to get there. As
it has been a while (4 weeks), I would like to re-boot my system. The
primary goal that is expected to drive all change and actions in my life
is based of this [[/Answers-finale.html][Answers]] post.

So in [Career-1][Career-1] we saw about some basics and the career data
I have. In the following post [Dream Job][Career-2], we discussed what
should be there in a dream job, such as flow, moderate amount of stress.
This post has a synopsis of the research on stress and my final
understanding. It's a good post I will keep it for now as it contains
quite some intersting things about long hours, stress and vacation. As
the post says, its everything about how a job should be and what it
should have, what I should look at in a job.

[Post 3][career-3] seems to be a post that can be skipped. I suspect it
was a post written for completeness. Then maybe it can stay.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There's no reason to be embarrassed by this fact, but it does
  emphasize how important it is to consider how you can use your good
  fortune to help others. In a more equal and intuitive world, we could
  just focus on helping those around us, and making our own lives go
  well. But it turns out we have an enormous opportunity to help other
  people with little cost to ourselves -- and it would be a terrible
  shame to squander it.
#+END_QUOTE

In [Post-4][career-4] we discuss where we need to focus and what we can
do to maximize our impact. There are several areas and several things
that we could do. With this post is quite clear that there are several
opportunities, and a proper analysis needs to be made so that we can
start in this direction over the next year.

In [Post-5][career-5] we discuss about how the suggestion of [80k
hours][80k-uur] is to start with direct work if possible rather than
earning to give. As it is not a shortage of funds that is the major
problem but the using of the funds in an effective way or channelling
funds to the right medium to create large/right impact.

All these posts are written not with a proper beginning or end. So I
guess I shall keep them and proceed further. I think what would be best
now is to do profiling of different fields, how I can get into that
field, my key uncertainities and what could be the impact. This is going
to be a highly experimental post. The main problem with this post is
going to be the uncertainity. Its gonna be cray cray cray.

Before that I also quickly make a synopsis of the 80k hours links...

*** Direct work vs indirect work (earning to give)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should earn
  to give long term.
  we think that most people should be doing things like politics,
  policy, high-value research, for-profit and non-profit
  entrepreneurship, and direct work for highly socially valuable
  organizations.  [1]
#+END_QUOTE

*** Choosing an area to focus

Work on neglected, solvable, personal-fit-making-sense,
expertise-making-sense type of problems.  [2]

*** Best approaches Which jobs are good/great?

-  Earning to give
-  Advocacy
-  Research
-  Direct work

[[https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/][80k hours high impact jobs]] suggest the following as the different ways to contribute

[[/career(5).html][This post]] written by me briefly discusses the
actions suggested in
[[https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/][80k hours high impact jobs]]. The outcome seems to me that that

1. either we become mathematicians, staticians or economicians
   (preferably Phd's)

2. Develop generic career capital involving leadership (founding),
   management abilities (fundraising large sums of money within
   bureaucracies)

3. Getting into policy making, shaping type of roles; Grant maker

4. Earning to give is always an option, but first we need to see what we
   can do directly.

The [[https://80000hours.org/career-quiz/#/][Career quiz]] suggest me the [[https://80000hours.org/career-quiz/#/quantitative=yes&verbalAndSocial=yes&riskTolerance=no&challengeTolerance=yes&careerStage=early&pathType=directImpact%252C+advocacy%252C+earningToGive%252C+research][following based on my answers]]:

-  Management consulting
-  Working at effective non-profits
-  Product manager at Tech
-  Data Science ( for skill-building & earning to give)
-  Economics phd
-  Software engineering at large tech-firms
-  Machine learning phdg

*** Career Capital

80k hrs is very clear in their advice *that we should look for opportunities of direct
impact rather* than earning to give, to begin with.

People peak after 10 to 20 years of experience. Being successful takes
time. Invest in your now for a better impact tomorrow.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  For instance, *learning marketing or management* is flexible because
  almost all organisations need these skills; whereas becoming an expert
  on Kenyan microfinance is not. - [80k hrs on Career
  Capital][80k-career-capital]
#+END_QUOTE

I read the story about Tara and constantly think that I am not that high
acheiver, what ever they touch which turns to gold. But thats ok, things
take time, and I am going to be that acheiver. Let's already start
learnign something. I am spending too much time just doing nothing.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If you're really uncertain, then you could make flexible career
  capital your main focus. As you learn more, you can make your plan
  more and more targeted. (We'll cover how to do this in a later
  article.)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Bear in mind, the advice “build flexible career capital” is not the
same as “don't close any doors”. Some people try to avoid committing
  to a specific path because they're unsure what to do. *Rather, the
  advice is to commit to a path in which you'll gain career capital
  that's useful in many other paths. Just pick an area, perform highly,
  learn valuable skills, and meet influential people.* You'll end up in
  a better position than if you try to do a bit of everything and don't
  achieve anything.
#+END_QUOTE

This is one of the important pieces of advice without which I would
just continue to mentally masturbate. I guess it is hard to already
know what you can do in the future. I feel that this above quote is an
easy way out of all the hard computations. It suggests to generically
go for something that I am a personal  fit in and kill at it! As long
as I am in one of the fields they have talked about, I should be good?

*Dont do a bit of everything!* 

**** Work at a growing organisation that has a reputation for high
performance

The skill consulting/management seems to give you!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Consulting works because the companies make you work hard, train you
  up, and put you around other productive people, building your skills
  and connections. These jobs are also widely recognised as competitive
  positions, which gives you a credential.*But there are many other
  positions that can provide similar benefits.*
