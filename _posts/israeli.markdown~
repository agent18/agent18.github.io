<!-- #### Feelings might be wrong-->

Now take this for example. 

>Other recent research shows similar results. Two Israeli psychologists asked people to contribute to a costly life-saving treatment. They could offer that contribution to a group of eight sick children, or to an individual child selected from the group. The target amount needed to save the child (or children) was the same in both cases. Contributions to individual group members far outweighed the contributions to the entire group.

###### Explain

I couldn't find the source online unfornately. It appears that the text is up for some interpretation. People had the choice to offer money to an induvidual child from the selected from the group or to the whole group. Contributions to the individual group, far outweighted the contributions of the entire group.

Essentially people wanted to donate to induvidual people instead of the whole group. 

>The target amount needed to save the child (or children) was the same in both cases.

While asking people to donate, the taget amount mentioned in the case of the group and induvidually was the same. I.e., both had a target of X$. I guess it could also mean that the target amount was multiplied by 8 to accomadate for saving all the children in the group. 

How important is this target amount in your discussion? I am not sure. I think it has an effect on the calclations I make later.

###### What is odd
The best thing to do would be for everyone to donate to the group, so that they maximize the contribution and save everyone. This is with the assumption that we want to save as many lives as we can. It appears that people want to save the children from their willingness to give money.

But the induvidual contributions seemed to be far higher. I can't understand the logic that they would choose just one person and help him tremendously rather than give the same amount of money to the group. Another question is "which person you would choose from the group?"

But the people ended up donating to an induvidual rather than a group.

As Eleizer writes in his [blog][], how can it be that 1,312,433,101 happy children are significantly better than 1,312,433,100 happy children, but then it is somewhat worse to have 1,312,433,108 happy children? 

The point I guess is not about donating to one person but colelctively to save as many lives as possible, but then the people seem to think that their job is done at 1.

There are probably a couple of hypothesis:
a) that the brain cannot make such calculations and the brain is wrong
b) there is some deep moral truth underlying the whole calculation and the brain is right

Knowing  some of the huerristics that the brain uses, such as the sugar urge, social proof and the like, to compute cheaply [[citation needed][]], the level of the brain should be clear. It's not some amazing machine that  I cannot imagine it being capable of performing such crazy calculations.

But for me the question is not about how the brain works, i.e, how the hueristics and biases exist. For me the unknown and the completely ununderstood is the things below the hueristics and biases.
