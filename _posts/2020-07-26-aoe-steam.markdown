Whats the basic procedure for linux games
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJC9oC49mXs 


Install steam, install game, set the proton and then tweeks if
necessary per game...

Other things to install such as winetrix etc...etc..

## Basic running I think

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbdvOUz1544&feature=youtu.be


## Things to do

1. 1 and 2 based on [basic procedure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJC9oC49mXs ).

2. Change Steam global settings to use proton: Steam / Settings /
   Steam Play --> Enable Steam Play For all titles.


### Tweeks needed for AOE 

0. Install the game:

	From [YouTube comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzXowgAUS9I&feature=youtu.be):
		
    > You have to enable Steam Proton for all your Steam library and
    > then download and install the game as normal. Once that is done,
    > then follow the instructions on this video. I did a previous
    > video on Steam Proton that might be helpful -
    > https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJC9oC49mXs&feature=youtu.be

1. Based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzXowgAUS9I&feature=youtu.be).

	sudo apt install winetricks
	
done. :)

2. Need to install the Media Foundation workaround for Wine
	
	https://github.com/z0z0z/mf-install
	
	Download and install it using the following after moving to folder
    of downloaded mf-install
    referencing to the game's "installation location":
	
		WINEPREFIX="/home/eghx/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/813780/pfx" ./mf-install.sh 
		
3. Install Microsoft Visual Runtime

		WINEPREFIX="/home/ryanjohnson/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/1017900/pfx"
		winetricks -q vcrun2017
		
4. Rename the video folder (otherwise it will crash)

	right click on game in steath --> properties --> go to local files
    --> Assets --> change the name of "Video" to anything else.
	
	You will get an error "Unable to setup bla bla bla"... noi worries
    keep gehen.
	
	Alternatively you can add -nostartup to the game's custom
    launcher, this has the same affect as renaming the Video folder. ???


Doesn't work...

redoing the mf-install.sh line...

worst case... remove game and redo the above steps fresh?

Try [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/dwuplr/how_to_run_age_of_empires_2_definitive_edition_on/) that I found on reddit

## winetricks vcrun2017 not found


- error: Unknown arg vcrun2017

so we atleast need a later version of 20170823

- link for Winetricks instructions and readme
:https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks

- [only old (2014) version of winetricks](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=winetricks) available in 16.04



1. Started with purging winetricks

2. Installing latest winetricks based off of here:
   https://askubuntu.com/a/755060/443958
   
   Did only first 2 steps. and now have version: 20200412

Now did the vcrun2017 And got error: 


``` terminal
------------------------------------------------------
Your version of wine 1.6.2 is no longer supported upstream. You should upgrade to 4.x
------------------------------------------------------
Executing mkdir -p /home/eghx/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/813780
------------------------------------------------------
You are using a 64-bit WINEPREFIX. Note that many verbs only install 32-bit versions of packages. If you encounter problems, please retest in a clean 32-bit WINEPREFIX before reporting a bug.
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

```

Now removed wine and updating to 4.x from 1.6.2 based on [winehqeiki](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu)

Notes on [winprefix and 32 and 64 bit shit](https://www.google.com/search?q=wine+32+bit+64+bit+difference&oq=wine+32+bit+64+bit+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j33l7.4958j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

There is so much detail here. And I am afraid I fucked up... I did the
vcrun2017 command but then I got an error type message.. Was that an
error or what? 

should I change wineprefix to 32bit? 

after successful installation of wine 5.0 I tried the vcrun2017
command again. It seems that wine is finally active and working and
asking me to install "gecko" etc...


``` terminal
You are using a 64-bit WINEPREFIX. Note that many verbs only install 32-bit versions of packages. If you encounter problems, please retest in a clean 32-bit WINEPREFIX before reporting a bug.

```

## Direct x 11 issues

It said compatibility not met... Tried ediitng th evideo folder and

He was setting some "set launch options"

## Graphic card issue:

Need to figure out if game is using my powerful nvidia graphic card. 

Didn't work.
		
## Space Issue: Identifying how to increase space [Solved]

Checked it out. It is very easy to do. But runs the risk of fucking up
Ubuntu and then re-installing. Currently all I need is like 10-20gb
space which I have more than enough of in my "non-root" partition. 

Made some notes [here](/resizing-ubuntu-dual-boot-partition.html).

### Issue of installation in the "root" "/"

- We have very little space in the "/" and we need to install things not
in "/" but else where.

exp:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/611775/does-steam-install-games-to-the-root-partition

- Steam doesn't install things in the root. It gives choice to install
  elsewhere.
