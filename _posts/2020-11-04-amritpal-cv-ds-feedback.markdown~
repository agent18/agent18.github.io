Hi Thej,

Overall it looks good. I just have following points to add as
suggestions:

1. In the profile section, I would either remove the line saying “with
   experience contributing python code to TU Munich Software”, or
   would **add more details to it as it is bit vague and too
   broad**. **What kind of software are you talking about? what
   contributions you had**?, etc.
   
   python source code contributed, adding functionality

2. In the project section, I would add more detail on the type of
   projects **(academic, commercial, competition, etc)**, your role
   (project lead, contributor, etc), and number of people involved if
   any. (skip) (**team work time management...**) overcome challenge
   in current field.

3. In NLP project, you optimized the **loading computations speed of what**? How
   did you do it? "Speed” is a subjective term and could vary
   depending upon the hardware you are using. It is better to add more
   details, perhaps it is more useful to provide details on **how you
   achieve those improvements**, via change in model architecture? or
   **via better software engineering methods**?
   
   have some baseline...
   
   computational overload computational runtime over 
   
   over the baseline.... try...
   
   Implementation for image classifi
   
   designed the NLP algorithm 

4. What do you mean by “Build an image classifier/ NLP model”? Did you
   design a network architecture, or **did you implement an existing
   architecture?** It is better to be more specific.

5. Accuracy number (**90%**, 24%) don’t mean much on their own. Though it
   is fine if you want to include them. It would perhaps be better if
   you can **compare** your accuracy numbers to existing numbers by
   state-of-the-art methods, if available. Or **provide details on what
   do these number represents**? for example, your company has a model
   in production with baseline accuracy of 20% and you achieved x%
   improvement by developing model with 24% accuracy.

6. I would use more professional term like an expert rather than
   “Go-to-guy for …”. sub-pixel registration...

7. At least to me this line is not self explanatory: “Used statistics
   to identify uncertainties with minimum measurements.” Perhaps add
   more details to “minimum measures”.

8. “lots of linear algebra “ How do you define “lots”. It is very
   subjective, be more precise.
   
   more heavy linear algebra which included....  
   (model order reduction, basis, reduced basis projections etc)

9. “Wrote code to optimize the topology of a 2D structure in MATLAB. “
   Your contribution in terms of "writing code” is not very
   clear. Perhaps use some more precise, like designed/improved an
   algorithm, etc… implemented an algorthm . 

10. "Saved 300 man hours and €20K in place of an already chosen
    concept at Mapper Lithography. “How? Perhaps list your
    contributions. 
	
	reduce budget... saved significant amount...
	
	(such as going beyond and asking for clarification on the
    requirements, and looking for other simpler solutions than the one
    that I was supposed to investigate)

11. I would include the contact information of the recommends.

add email if necessary linkedin....

(If they want, I think they need to check with me...)

Let me know if you have any questions regarding these points. Also
attaching my CV.
