## Current laptop

- mouse pad not fully useable, but I still can continue to use it
- Sleep doesn't last long on ubuntu, I also think the same with
windows 10.
4 years old

## Do I want to solve it or get a new laptop

### Solving it

I think I have a few more hours to decide if something will work or
not. There seem to be options for hybernation, but ultimately I would
like something that I can suspend and move from one place to
another. I think the current sleep capability is definitely a few
hours(3-6 hrs).


Inability to sleep more than 5 hrs lets say.

So I always work at home, sometimes I have to take my laptop
somewhere, very rarely, say when I am going to india, when I am going
to a tax consultant, thats when I would need the laptop alive with the
necessary docs opened. In the worst case I can check how hibernation
works.

Also a quick look at hibernation, shows problems associated with
it. Of course everything has problems with ubuntu, but also solutions!

Getting stuck due to opening of a couple of tabs on the
machine. Although it is chrome that I opened today morning, it was
clear that there were these memory hogging sites and they really took
away my ram to the point of getting things stuck. Going for a higher
ram seems slightly future proof as well.


#### Worries

2 questions wihtout marked answers on stack for ubuntu 16.

For when I need it to be reliable for more than 1 day?


how often does that happen?


Fucking up the battery by keeping it on for ever?

Hybernation slow? not the same as suspend?

Ideally I would liek something that I can close and open at will, and
not have to worry about reducing the battery life (estimated at 50
Euros/piece). The life of this Laptop @ max is expected to be 2 years,
but it runs amazingly now. Software centre opens in no fucking time
at all. Shocking.

The life of a battery is about 500 recharges after which it reduces in
capability, (~2 years). I remember for my HP laptop I did buy a new
battery 3 years after living. I used the fuck out of the battery,
always kept it in charge etc.. I can't remember when I actually lost
control of the battery. But I use that laptop for everything.


Worst case: 


| Year | Dell Latitude E5430 | New laptop |   |   |
|------|---------------------|------------|---|---|
| 1    | 200                 | 700        |   |   |
| 2    | 50                  |            |   |   |
| 3    | 500                 | 50         |   |   |
| 4    |                     |            |   |   |
| 5    | 50                  | 50         |   |   |
| 6    |                     |            |   |   |
| 7    | 50                  | 100        |   |   |
| 8    |                     | 100        |   |   |
| 9    | -                   | -          |   |   |
| 10   |                     |            |   |   |
|      |                     |            |   |   |


Assuming a laptop lasts for 6 years, 100 bucks for life after 6 years,
adn 50 bucks every 2 years, these are the numbers I see. 

With the Dell Latitude E5430, I would have costs of 850 over 8 years
and with 1000 with a new laptop over 8 years. The dell laptop with its
basic flaws such as inability to sleep in case I ever need it.


I can return the laptop within the next 2 days, it sure appears that
the inability to sleep might be a very small inconvinience
## Summary

It appears that if I invest 700 for a new laptop it might still make
sense in the long run.

## How much money I have?
