## Introduction

EA is TC apprently, but there seems to be a lot of evidence that it is
not. And as I am trying to figure out what I need to do in life, I am
confused and want to clarify my thoughts.

## Definitions

We are going to be primarily dealing with the term "Talent
Constrained". To avoid confusion we try to understand what it is
first. 80khours defines TC in "[Why you should work on Talent
gaps](https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/#what-are-talent-gaps)" (Nov 2015):

> For some causes, additional money can buy substantial progress. In
> others, the key bottleneck is finding people with a specific skill
> set. This second set of causes are more “talent constrained” than
> “funding constrained”; we say they have a “talent gap”.

Ok! A cause is TC if finding people with specific skill set proves to
be difficult. The difficulty I assume is in the lack of specifically
skilled people and not some process/management constrain. [EA
Concepts](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/talent-constraints-vs-funding-constraints/) however, clears this confusion up with a better worded
("actively hiring") "example":

> Organization A: Has annual funding of $5m, so can fund more staff,
> and has been actively hiring for a year, but has been unable to find
> anyone suitable... Organization A is more talent constrained than
> funding constrained...

**Note**: In this article, discussions are on "Orgs that are TC" and
not "Causes that are TC". I am unable at this moment to add value when
I am told that AI strategy Cause is TC with the lack of
"Disentanglement Research" (DR). But if I know FHI and many other orgs
is TC in DR, then I can plausibly get skilled in DR and apply to close
the lack of people with that skill set. So looking at causes for me is
less helpful and less concrete for me and is not what I have set out
to uncover.

## Why I think EA is TC

EA has been and is talent constrained according to surveys made by
80khours and CEA since 2017. Several organizations seem to think so in
these surveys: [2017 survey](https://80000hours.org/2017/11/talent-gaps-survey-2017/), [2018 survey](https://80000hours.org/2018/10/2018-talent-gaps-survey/#appendix-2-answers-to-open-comment-questions), [2019
survey](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TpoeJ9A2G5Sipxfit/ea-leaders-forum-survey-on-ea-priorities-data-and-analysis). In all the surveys EA's on average claim to be more Talent
Constrained than Funding constrained. For example in 2019 EAOs
reported feeling more (3 out of 5 rating) Talent Constrained and less
(1 out of 5 rating) Funding Constrained[^11]. More details in the
footnote [^1].

80khours doesn't seem to have not changed it's position on this matter
in its posts for a while now. Since 2015 already, 80khours seems to be suggesting that
we should focus on providing talent to the community rather than ETG
in ["Why you should focus on talent gaps and not funding
gaps](https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/). They make the case that if someone can setup a Charity that
meets GiveWell's criteria, then they seem to have access to 10s of
millions of dollars. Another example 80khours made was about AI Safety
and that the funds were enough as per the evaluation of Open Phil and
that there are people who are ready to donate even more funds, but
think there isn't enough "talent pool" (back in 2015)[^12]. We
continue to find posts in June 2017 on ["Working at EAO](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/) and ["The
world desperately needs AI strategists](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-desperately-needs-ai-strategists-heres-how-to-become-one/)[^16].  On March 31st,
2018 : "[Why operations management is the biggest bottleneck in
EA](https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/)".

Even in Nov 2018, (in a post that is meant to clarify confusion on
TC), they say, that problem areas are constraind by specific skills,
like DR in Strategy and Policy. Basically clarifying that they don't
mean that EA in general is not EA, but there are definitely some areas
where EA is TC without Talent X. That's good, more refined
claim. 

## Where is EA TC?

The surveys from 2017 to 2018 that inform that the Orgs are TC, also
provide info on what sort of talent the EA orgs and EA as a whole
would need. The results of the top 7 "talents" are below:

|   | 2017        | 2017 (EA)   | 2018       | 2018 (EA)  | 2019      | 2019 (EA)   |
|---|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | GR          | G&P\***     | Oper.      | G&P\***    | GR        | G&P\***     |
| 2 | Good Calib. | Good Calib. | Mngment    | Oper.      | Oper.     | Mngment     |
| 3 | Mngment     | Mngment     | GR         | ML/AI      | Mngment   | H. GPR\*\*  |
| 4 | Off. mngers | ML/ AI tech | ML/AI      | Mngment    | ML        | Founding    |
| 5 | Oper.       | Movt. build | H. GPR\*\* | Hustle GPR | Econ/math | Soc. Skill  |
| 6 | Math        | GR          | Founder    | GR         | HighEA\*  | ML          |
| 7 | ML/AI       | Oper.       | Soc. skill | Founding   | H. GPR    | Movt. Build |

\* High level overview of EA  
\*\* The hustle to really figure out what matters most and set the
right priorities  
\*\*\* Government and Policy 

Although some of the "talents" are down right vague, the rest of them
seem to ring a bell with me as to what they could mean. For example
when I think of GR, I think of a Generalist Researcher in Open Phil or
GiveWell, whereas when I think of "hustle to really figure out what
matters" or "one-on-one social skills", I have 0 examples in mind and
have no idea what they are talking about.

Anyways, as the Orgs that are TC inform the talents that they need
more of over the next 5 years, I assumed that this is a proxy for
"These are the skills that are causing TC". Plus 80khours mentions
that their use these surveys to form their view in addition to their
own assessment [^2].

In Aug 2018, 80khours writes an article [High Impact Careers](https://80000hours.org/articles/high-impact-careers/#why-did-we-choose-these-categories),

> In brief, we think our list of top problems (AI safety, biorisk, EA,
> GPR, nuclear security, institutional decision-making) are mainly
> constrained by research insights, either those that directly solve
> the issue or insights about policy solutions.

Great! So research in these areas are TC. That is really sad
indeed. Everyone should work on solving the bottleneck. 80khours in
the same article also lists the priority career paths (which I read as
TC):

- AI strategy and Policy research
- AI safety technical research
- Grant maker focused on top areas
- Work in effective Altruism orgs
- Global priorities researcher
- Bio-risk strategy and policy
- China Specialists
- Earning to give in quant trading
- Decision making psychology research and roles

Then there are a bunch of hyped posts for operations and AI Strategy:

- [The world desparately needs AI strategists](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-desperately-needs-ai-strategists-heres-how-to-become-one/)
- [Why operations management is one of the biggest bottlenecks in
  effective altruism](https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/#which-traits-do-you-need)
  
It appears that another way to arrive at these above "priority career
paths" is to look at the problem profiles and check what the
bottlenecks are. For example, in the [profile on AI](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/) (March 2017),
we see that 80khours calls for people to help in AI technical
research, AI strategy and policy, Complimentary roles and Advocacy and
capacity building. So basically EVERYTHING IN AI except ETG. Got it. I
assume 80khours came to the priority paths based on this.

## Let's help the world out

I have been using 80khours since 2017 and have read almost all their
posts, spent weeks after weeks using them to make up what I should be
doing. They have made a lot of claims in the past, as in the previous
section. Unfortunately, 80khours doesn't seem approachable other than
through coaching (which is only for the ELITE), no discussions happen
in their comment sections, and I didn't know of any other sources
doing this sort of research. So being as low IQ as I am I formed the
impression as shared by my brother [EA applicant](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really):

> Hey you! You know, all these ideas that you had about making the
> world a better place, like working for Doctors without Borders?
> They probably aren’t that great. The long-term future is what
> matters. And that is not funding constrained, so earning to give is
> kind of off the table as well. But the good news is, we really,
> really need people working on these things. We are so talent
> constraint...--- [EA applicant](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really)

And looking at the 276 upvotes this post got (the highest ever in this
forum), it might appear that a lot of people agree with the sentiment
that EA could potentially be seriously TC (courtesy of 80k). Let's all
go and help the world out.

Somehow by accident I found EA Forum. Until I saw EA Forum 2 weeks
back (by accident), the word of 80khours was the word of God. And that
opened a pandora box of evidence (which I am really really grateful
for).

## EA is not TC

## You wont get into EA

Start with 80khours telling people they shouldn't ETG (as it is
pointless). They should focus on 

and maybe list all the people who didn't get in

## How I think 80khours misleads everybody

- definitions 

- no examples

- working for the elite

or try to see if you can make that a post the things I have written
earlier.

or maybe it is just better to take mild digs at them... here and
there.
