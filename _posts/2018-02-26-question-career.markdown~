# Questions for Career

In the last essay I covered very briefly that I would like to work on
certain things such as:
 
 
 
## Rant

I am done with the procrastination. I am done with feeling sorry for
myself. I am done feeling overwhelmed. I am not done though. I am
capable enough to handle all this shit. I want to figure out what
questions I would want answered before I move on. Dit is het.


I have like a million thoughts going in my mind. I don't know which to
focus on. I want to help myself stream line my thinking with this
essay. Tell myself these are the things I need to do. Give a way
ahead.

Also write 750 words a day

## Todays 750 words of publishable shit - Getting to the questions

### What is missing? 

I need to write or think about the best way to proceed further.

When I am working on stuff at work, there is some sort of
structure. As I said earlier I find it hard to come up with answers,
there are so many  things to do. 

I don't know what are my exact criteria, how to evaluate different
options? 

Well I do know that I have to use I have to use things like personal
fit, skills to be gained, connections and the other one while doing
this. But it is still wague. What are the actual skills that I need?
How does personal fit compare with other things? ability to do direct
work in the future

### Very clear examples of what I could be doing in the future

Some linkedin profiles based off of 80k uur and actual things that I
could be doing, or I see myself doing.

### Career paths
There are a couple of career paths I have in mind based on 80k
hours. From the previous post?


   What would be earnings? and what could be direct impact
   possibilities?
   How do I bloddy get there?
   What would be the evaluation of different parameters?
   What could be improvements?
   What are the costs to improve? 
   So here again there are like 2 things. Ideally one could become
   something but what are the chances one becomes the ideal scenario?
   How to evaluate something like this? 
   
Our current options are:
1. Sticking to design engineering or doing something here and
   maximizing ability to product lead
   
2. Data science

3. Programming

4. Management consulting at the Big 3

5. Investment banking

6. Doing a business? Business management and business opportunities
writing dumping etc...

7. Marketting

8. other things to research

high paying jobs in the netherladns (200k jobs Kaththi) that I could
migrate to

>Always Name your uncertainity, dont just say its a bunch of shit or
>its complicated or feel overwhelmed

Several variations exist within each chosen field that vary the
deciding parameters. For example, if you look at deisng engineering,
we see that it could vary based on location (US, Netherlands, or
other), what else? If you can 

### Going to the US?

How and why?

### Going to Dubai?

### How long before I get citizenship in netherlands and what do I
need for that?

Speak to Ram

### Final list of career paths

### Breaking sterotypes

Essay can be 1k words. but short essays to be compiled later needn't
be

I will write quickly adn then rewrite and cut all things
uneccessary. While doing this the word count gets affected for me. So
for example, right now, I am struggling. I want to publish everyday
atleast 500 to 600 words. for making a firsst draft I could use the
750 words but for rewrites i think I might do better focussing on
publishing. What say. After a few days, I can re-write them, say every
one week to make an actual post.

## Making a big list of options.

Right now the problems I work would just allow me the ability to
earn-to-give and allow me career capital with which I should be able
to be bigger things.

Bigger things would look like this:

He started the "Founder's forum for good"

> Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance (from a philosophy degree) in the US, started
> and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
> in California.

Management, finance, marketting and sales seems to surely have its benifits

### Design engineering in the US

### Data Scientist

### Programming/ Software engineer at google

### Investment banking with 100 mill
