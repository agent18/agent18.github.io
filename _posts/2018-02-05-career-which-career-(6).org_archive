Today is Jan 17, over the last few weeks, (7 weeks), I was on vacation
and sick or just sick. I am back now. Don't want to stall further my
progress. Don't want to think that I have wasted so many days, so
wasting one more day cannot do any harm. I don't want to think of the
past, I want to rock the future.

I will "work" 2 hrs every day. In case I forsee some event, I am allowed
to pre-work this 2 hrs as I like for a rainy day. I have missed the
monday and tuesday, but that's ok. I will move on, leave the past and
focus on the future. And to that I raise my glass to a 30 day continuous
"work-fest" of 2 hrs a day. The only exclusion from doing it would be to
if I am sick or some other unforseeable event takes place in life (I
leave it to the users moral values to be the judge of it). I only say 2
hrs and not give what I have to do, as I see that I have failed in the
past with the schemes I proposed. Well, I didn't write my learnings from
them as well. I will adhoc come up with challenges as and when
necessary.

The reader is warned that there used to be a time when the same thigns
was happening and the reader struggled big time to clock the 2 hrs. But
well, that was before the whole motivation speech. Anyways, enough of
this shit. Lets gets the day staaaaarted,.... waaat!

For the weak days... You have 1 hr since the time you arrive to start
work. No distractions are permitted once work has begun (including
unecessary mail checking or phone checking), excluding the 10 min break
in between. By 10 I mean 10.

For the wek ends.. On saturday this shall be worked begin before noon)
and be done.

On sunday I will work for 1 hr only. Its fine.

I will log the amount of work done everyday. cheers! No crime for
forgetting but lets not.

In addition to go with this. I will do cardio every day bro. and workout
for 4-5 days a week. In case of injuries I am permitted leave from
working out. but not cardio.

  dont look at the past and feel bad that you have hardly improved,
  brood over that you suck (Well yes you do), but I know a way out of
  hell... If I do the next 3 months properly, All the past shit will not
  matter,
#+END_QUOTE

All problems shall be fixed after or before clocking the 2 hrs. Cannot
be substituted for real work.

This is the plan for the next 30 days.

The internet issue needs to be fixed. well? I allow this exception.
