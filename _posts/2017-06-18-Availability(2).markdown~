#### Investigation into the not-clear

Probability judgements are strongly correlated to reporting frequencies. I believe Eleizer added 'skewed' to inform that our judgments are wrong af! but why did he add 'skewed' to the reporting? Probably because reporters were assumed to be selectively reporting, which is not 'Truth', hence skewed. Probability judgements(sentence 1) I assume are a result of availability(sentence 2), i.e. information available to memory allowing us to make guesses. Reporting frequencies(sentence 1) seem to be the same as referring to more reported-on. And Sentence 1 and 2 seem to be practically the same.

Here are my following hypothesis where the error might be in my understanding:

First hypothesis is that the assumption 'Probability judgements(sentence 1) I assume are a result of availability(sentence 2)' is wrong. Second is based on the fact that they use the term 'more'; That Eleizer is questioning if more reports => more availability to the memory. Third- Correctional data might not actually mean anything, as evidenced in sentence 2.

Hypothesis 1 seems not so probable. More reports needn't mean more availability to the memory; for example, reports might not be proportional to availability, that is to say that it could be an exponential or an x^2 graph; But as I try to explain what the other examples could be to support hypothesis 2, I am unable to come up with anything. Thats where my doubts regarding this hypothesis still continue to stay. And the more I look at it, the more it seems to me that I might be wrong. Looking at the data (Sentence 1), doesn't it already say that more availability was based on more frequency? 

I will investigate correlation and causality tomorrow.

Bis bald!


#### Correlation and causality 

Yesterday we were discussing regarding the following. Seemingly similar sentances as below.
