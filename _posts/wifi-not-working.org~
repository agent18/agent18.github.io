* Tasks
** TODO fix wifi
** TODO form hypothesis


* observation
- its not only the video websites, even youtube is not streaming

- youtube on laptop is not streaming, while youtube on tab and phone work


- The whole thing is very sudden, all was good back home, maybe I rammed the laptop onto something killing the wifi alltogether.


* simplified obs


* Hypothesis if necessary to be tested

- Wifi driver fucking up
  - test with another wifi
  - reset wifi driver

  

- reset wifi and see how it works?

- signal is weak not because of the distance from the router

  -  780p works now, but didnt work earlier!

-chrome is the culprit?

- maybe updates are not done, or last update fucked it up!
  - updated everything. and restarted. youtube works on the fly, not issues in the beginning.
  - testing vidup carmicheal show as well to see if it works as expected! run for 20 mins as success\
  -  great it disconnected again! after 10 mins... until then life was good




** keeping track of issues

1. iwconfig is not working

2. wifi switches off for RT3942 adapter

3. could be something to do with power management

Doesn't matter if it is unplugged or plugged. shits the same1

4. going to reboot my question...
