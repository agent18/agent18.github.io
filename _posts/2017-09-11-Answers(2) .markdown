#### **Highlights from 'Answers' made last week**

Last week we started the 'Answers' series to the 'Questions' post. These are the summarized conclusions we came up with.

>A Socrates can never be convinced about magic. He either has the magic a.k.a, the primary/basic rules, or not.

>You cannot convince a rock, you cannot convince an infinitely powerful computer about south sudan, or a very very smart dog that can talk.

>We have these primary rules, somehow. We can use them to understand the territory better. Initially we thought, blacks should be slaves, women should not have equal rights, but then slowly, we realized that they are also just people like us. It just happened by chance that we were not born black. If we would not like this to be our treatment, then it should most likely not be theirs. And then we modify our understanding of the rules. So, we have primary rules somehow, and we can use these rules to improve our understanding of our rules.

> It appears that as these rules cannot be taught to you- as Socrates can never be convinced as he doesn't have that rule- the only place possible to receive it from is like from our "father", Evolution, just like how we carry characteristics in our genes.

We have answered the 'basic' questions from the 'Questions' post, mostly off of the 1st discussion with an STM.

#### **Rules**

This is the model we are using.
>It is like a rough map of some terrain. Initially, it just marks out some hills and a river (“Don’t kill me, I won’t kill you. Let’s hunt together”). Nothing is to scale. There are vast parts unmarked (“how to treat women, blacks, gays, etc.”). Then, as we gain more and more knowledge, we fill in the vaguer parts of the map (“Ah! Black people are basically just like me. It is wrong to treat them like slaves”)

We start now with our current understanding of our primary/basic rules ("Look at evidence to determine reality as you have seen your feelings fail you again and again", "Modes Ponens"), the ones that you cannot be actually convinced about. From this understanding we formulate new rules ("Religion is the shizzz"). Now we use the primary/basic rules to re-understand our newly formulated rules ("Is religion really the shizz?"), and also try to clarify what our basic/primary rules actually mean in various extrapolations, cause they are so vague now ("how do I use evidence correctly, as I have limited computational ability and moreover my thoughts are clouded by my H&B").

>  Shouldn't everyone have the same values?

Looking at the rules we saw in the previous essay gives us more insight to answering the question I think.

> If A => B is accepted, then if A happens, then B can be inferred. (intellectual rule)
> Look at evidence to decide what the reality will be like (intellectual rule)
> When people are suffering we should help them (value rule)

Without Modes Ponens, I suppose education would be really hard, or for that matter communication. Evidence based understanding is there everywhere. It's in science, even in religion and literally everywhere else. But there is a catch, the understanding of evidence seems to differ between the different patrons. Recently, I joined a group on fb that was debating about flat earth and globe earth. The earth is not flat(let's not get into the details of it). But Flat Earthers (FEs), made wild claims, and supported every claim with some sort of evidence. Every piece of explanation someone gave FEs regarding Flat Earth seemed to their eyes as evidence. They definitely think it is a good idea to look at evidence, but their understanding of reliable evidence is quite something else. We use science, they contradict science. Science works whether you like it or not. It was no surprise that all the FEs came from the school of Christianity. They went out of their way to make the bible right. Bible is right and from there they worked on finding "evidence" to fit it. **It appears that we do have the same true rules, but our current understanding of the rules are twisted.**

Peter Singer writes in [Famine, Affluence and ...][], "I suppose, most of them would want to save a drowning baby, even if it means that you get your clothes dirty". Time and again we see several people donating money because it pains them to see others suffer. Although they don't take it to the logical conclusion. Let's for now say that it is due to some H&B's misfiring. But it appears that the rule still holds for most of us. 'Suffering is bad'.

Looking at the 3 rules we now know it appears with some decent confidence that **most people have the same/similar basic/primary rules, the difference comes in understanding and using them as we saw with the FE example**. Other examples, could be belief in astrology, homeopathy, ghosts aka paranormal activity etc...

How do you know your understanding is the best?(added to backlog)

#### **Looking in detail: Religion H&B and more**

As we saw last week, we are able to change our understanding of the rules, by reasoning, looking at evidence, using methods that show reliable and repeatable results every single time (for example, science). One of the understanding of the rules changed in the past for me was religion. It just didn't hold up to the questions asked.

Why did I get into it in the first place? And why was I in it for so long and then why did I just get out of it after such a long time? What was different, if your true rules don't change? We can change our understanding of our rules. It doesn't just happen by itself normally. We need to really put some effort to understand it better, despite what we might feel is right (owing to H&B's). And make sure it stands up to all our questions asked.

It appears that H&Bs is where shit went cray. Terrorists, republicans, democrats, socialists, etcetera. We have this amazing thing called H&B. These were probably a mechanism to bridge the billion rules and billion facts that we would need to process in order to understand the true rules. But hey, we don't have the computational resources to do that. So what does the brain do? H&B's are to be understood as shortcuts that connect us to our true value system, in a really bad way. They might have worked well for small problems back in the days, but right now they massively back fire, with [circular preferences][], misinterpretation of the true SITH, etc...

>Then Why do terrorists exist? When will Achilles be wrong?

H&B's such as social proof, social conditioning etc... can really twist the understanding of a persons SITH. It was very easy to believe in religion. We might think we are doing something right. Screwed up logic can sound perfect (H&B). We are not trained to critically analyze what people say to us, the analogies they make and how it affects us. Imagine a small kid, growing up with terrorists, reading the kuran every single day, being told that death is the penalty for leaving religion, being shown and told conservative views about how women should dress and repetitive saying of "the world should have only muslims", to the extent that he doesn't mind even giving up his own life.

>Social proof (also known as informational social influence) is a psychological and social phenomenon where people assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior in a given situation.    
-[Wiki][]

Get this!**If the same kid was brought up in a different part of the world, there is a high chance he would not be a terrorist**. Social proof, social conditioning are no joke. He would have completely different world views. When you see from a high level, you see that the kid is same, but his surroundings make him understand his SITH very differently. If you are not taught the scientific way of understanding things, which means to trust evidence of repeatable and reproducible experiments only, then higher chance of you being fucked and getting dragged into random ideologies for no better reason other than things like Social proof. However, it appears to be possible that everyone can come to *similar* ideas in the end, if only they followed a rigorous, scientific process of understanding themselves, and the things around them; Even terrorists. When you are ready for change, when evidence strongly points that your understanding is wrong, when you look to understand your rules better, I guess, you will start your own vishwaroopam transformation. Change is hard, change is painful, but certainly change is possible. We can definitely do it. So many people have done it.

I say everyone can come to _similar ideas_ because, even though Eliezer and Robin Hanson have the same end goal, 'to turn the world into an advanced civilization', both differ in their way of handling the problem, in some aspects (Not going into that now). It's hard for everyones subjective probability to completely align I guess (Not getting into this either). I suspect this is the reason. To a point its all numbers very distinctive and straightforward, but then after that. Our powers are still finite.

**Terrorists seem to exist because of a misconception in their understanding of their true values.**

**Achilles will go wrong, will take the other tracks, only when his understanding of the "right track" is out of sync with reality.**

#### **Updating your rules based on evidence**

For me what to do in life, has changed mighty much. Initially, just like the herd it was about 'being successful, getting lot of money and bitches', then it moved on to 'god', then 'Tim Ferrise's 4 hr work week and about taking constant mini-retirements, giving less of a fuck about making more money', then 'PUA and gaining social status', and then random stuff for a while, and then back to this.

An stm said this last weekend, and I quite agree with him.

>Looking at the big picture it might appear that you can't commit to one thing, you are fickle minded, you are "easily convinced", you don't stand your ground. What ever that means! Now you might say that you won't marry and later you might end up marrying. But in the end, we need to understand that we need to change in front of the mighty evidence. Just staying your current ground, just because you have been believing in it for so long, doesn't sound like a solid argument. And what are the chances you got it right in the first try anyway? It is surprising that people refuse to change even despite the weight of the evidence, still clinging to the past. Are they saying they got everything right the first time itself, that no amount of interrogation can change it. What are the chances? What are the chances? Look at the whole population that is marrying, without a single point of doubt or even any analyses. And look at those people advising people to marry. Haha. Its I who knows the statistics, it's I who has done the research not them.

Yes every time it sounded like this was it. 'This' is what we were going to do for the rest of our lives. I started planning my life based on religion and suddenly got thrown off of the bus. Good thing it didn't happen after many more years. Changing in the face of evidence how many ever times, doesn't seem to matter. In fact what are the chances others hit the nail in the head the first time anyway. It seems to take a few tries to get it right. It only looks like a good thing that in the face of mighty evidence, we are nothing, we shall change, we need to change.

**So Achilles goes wrong when his understanding of the rules go cray.**

#### **What to trust?**

- **How do we know which feelings to trust? What is the criterion with which we can reliably distinguish false feelings from real ones? Does emotional stimulation and visual stimulation help in determining the real value system?**

-**How much is a human life worth to you? how far do we go to save it?**


#### **How to understand what we truly want?**
The thing we have with us, is our feelings. Everything is a feeling. We have feelings, which give us an indication of what we might want, but then they are circular. Feelings are primarily (to my knowledge) operated by the mighty H&B's. This is where the confusion comes from.  We have some data, as a result of H&B. This data is a filter on our rules. We don't know what our true rules are. We hope to get to the rules say by adding a negative filter to the H&B, having been able to understand several of these H&B's, atleast sticking to the most important ones.

H&B's guide our feelings. H&B's are shortcuts. H&B's are circular and cannot be trusted in many situations to represent the true SITH. For example, the feeling you get when we give food worth 2 Euros to a homeless person; their face, the thanks that you receive, is nothing short of beautiful. Whereas say, you donated a few hundred euros to an NGO that has the best potential to save many lives; You get hardly anything via a feeling. **Feelings are skewed max.**

All we have is the H&B and our feelings. How do we go from there to determining what the real value system wants. We see two sets of reactions to an event of a kind. For example, People are dying everywhere, we don't feel like helping someone in a remote land far far away, but someone we see in person suffering, we seem to be more emotionally stimulated. Another example is we cry for a minute on fb when we see 40k people suffering, but then the next moment we are back to watching Youtube as though life is normal. Our H&B's work to be emotionally more stimulated when something happens in front of us [fact][], rather than behind us. But then you check with your SITH, but how does that make a life more valuable. It makes sense as a shortcut, but well not as a real rule. So whether we are visually stimulated or not, whether someone is close by or not, we sure as hell want to help. Great.

Now we go on to the next big question. How far do we go? We check with our SITH, when thinking about a drowning baby, and the answer comes from within, that clothes are fucking not important. Then you think how much you can pay, and the thing is there is not one drowning baby but several. Saving every child might not be possible, but saving as many children as possible could be one of the conclusions. This is where you ask for more hardcore evidence to join the EA club. But...

<!--
The one question I have been on again and again is about how to differentiate between the right and wrong feelings w.r.t your true value system, if everything is a feeling which are a direct result of H&B's. In other words, when are H&B's right and when are they wrong. My question is much more specific, how far do we go, to save a life. There is no question that I will and everyone should not concern themselves with dirtying their clothes, when it comes to saving a drowning baby. Can we extrapolate this directly to saying that we should go all the way, so far that, we just are barely able to survive as long as we can and continue serving mankind?

But then most of our actions are not in that direction.

Could it be that perhaps, your actions are not in that direction because of your H&B's. For example, we all know that in chennai there was a crisis, in december 2 years back. The whole city was drowning and every single person who was able, came out and helped people. A whole community was formed, and several tweets that food, blankets biscuit packets is available here and there and what not. At any point in time there are people dying. Just because someone dies in front of you doesn't mean your duty towards mankind suddenly increases. It is just that your H&B's are visually stimulated, i.e., when they actually see things, they feel at a higher level, than when they waguely know someone somewhere in a far far place. I can pull out many many incidents, where people help, where people want to help.

#### Reversing H&B's

Reversing H&B's in this case would be to help people regardless of their our nearness to the situation.

But then how do you put finger on how much to do to save a life or lives. Say there are 40k lives (refugees) to be saved, from diseases such as malaria, also including 10 child deaths per day, due to malnutrition, diseases etc...

For me, it's about this... how do you say to those people, "Guys, I have other important things to do. I need to fuck women as often as I can, I want flow, I want to play video games, and enjoy life, looking hot as long as I can". When in the room, I tear up AF although for a bried moment, when I see them suffer, when I hear that 10 children are going to die, and death is not going to be the one which is painless, its going to be the one that's slow and painful. How do you say to these people, who just for fucks sake who are not born in your country or in your region. And the hypocracy of the event is that, Germans are being blamed for the mass slaughter of the jews, and what are we being blamed for? nothing? How about inaction?. If this happened in NEtherlands, I am sure, everyone would feel much more close to the problem adn help out. Is that a fucking good enough reply to south my fucking sudan.

How can you not do anything despite taking in small pains.  and its not even that painful!

I kept axing an STM, "How, how do I fucking know what is important?", thats when the motherfucker launched on an epic line of stories about achilles and socrates" Surely that is supposed to mean something right? But what?

Could it be that there can be absolutely nothing that can convince me?

In that case can I make the decision or not?

So here you go my friend... What is important to you?

An xbox or a drowning baby. No contest.

An xbox or 40000 lives of which you can probably save 1/3rd of just one life. (Cost of life being estimated)
All we have with us now, are those primary/basic rules (the ones that need no convincing), and these feelings which come from H&B's.

Even if I am saving one life, giving him food, shelter, although I might not feel like it what should I do...

It somehow feels right to put your money and change as many lives as you can? but what is the logic you ask? well!

Looking at all the people suffering, all the lives the possible lives that you can impact and change the lives of, what in a balance can equate to quashing all that I axe myself? how can I say to them or to anyone, that I have something much more important to me, such as finding babes, regularly buying games to feed your xbox hunger, and finding a pleasurable life..

And don't worry bro, Father's got you. He has your back. He will give you or you can get from him, something much more meaningful perhaps...  This is it?

How do you know you are not just acting out of social pressure?

or for that matter visual stimulation
Let's look at scope sensitivity and see what we can do with it, and how to reverse it etc...

#### explore how I can use the unconvincible statements


What about [this][video of hugging] imagine how this would feel? So what how can I yebull to say that I need this, and deny people what they should be getting, we are talking first world problems bitch?

####

So yesterday I was discussing how there is this one thing that I don't know how to fend off. **How can I knowingly give up on all the people who are suffering, so as to have some pleasure**. Say by spending on products (a 200 Euro cycle perhaps ;)), spending on getting girls (learning salsa), spending on travel and other amazing (useless) things. At this point spending on flow activities can also be forgiven, but on [pleasure][], seriously nigga? Because you don't get your moneys worth for the buck you pay.

To come back, I have no argument other than the above in favour of choosing EA. I constantly came up with this thing that how would I know which feelings are right? 'I cry for a brief moment when I think about south sudan', 'the very next second I am back to my usual shabang'... Based on these how would I choose one of them as being the thing that I want? And how do I know how much I would wan't them, when this is all the evidence I have. It appears that I can't know how much I would want to save lives.

Granted we are visually stimulated beings, we have several flaws via the H&B's. A classic example is the action people take when a building is burning down in front of their eyes. Several heroes are found. But when the same building breathes fire in a distant location, even though we can offer similar help to the building, from afar, we pretty much don't feel it and don't do much about it. There are many such metaphorical buildings in fire anyway.

Imagine, you had the option to eat an ice cream or save a life, No discussion. Easy question.

What if this question jumped to being something like, 1000 Euros vs a life, what do you do? How do you get to the right answer? Just how?

Maybe I just want to play xbox the whole day, or do the thing that makes me happy or something (will come back to this happy thing later, there seems to be evidence that you are always put under misery so that you do better. Contentment is not really good for evolution. you constantly need to strive for besser)

#### Will the real slim shady please stand up
Can the real slim shady, please convince me about "saving a drowning baby while getting your shirt dirty in the mud is a good thing no contest!"

I have the suspision now that this is all you can do, although  this seemed like a shitty argument when an STM said that to me in the end, when I possibly lacked the mana pakkuvam necessary. I can rememebr an STM saying something like, "You cannot be convinced or something like there is no evidence" You can either choose to belive it or not.

What do you mean this is all you can do?

I am looking for hardcore evidence that will inform me that "I should live my life for the people, because that is what I truely want"

But until now I haven't gotten any, whatever you would consider as hardcore proof in the first place?

I seem to be stuck here with the only statement I have, "How can I knowingly give up on all the people who are suffering, so as to have some pleasure". No seriously, isn't that a crime? Not doing anything when you can do something, or even a lot. All this knowing that there are very few people, understanding what they need to do and help out actively. AS PEter says in his article, " If everyone helped then we should only need 5$ per person, but then that is not the case, which means we need to counter for the effect that is the population".

The solution inside the head is the only thing that I guess we have been consulting with. Once you saw the statements that needed no convincing, that should have been the clue. Why treat blacks and whites equal anyways, so what if they are people. What magic is this? The SITH evolves. In the beginning it probably thought, it was too much to give up on dreams and work hard off my ass to help out some random people. But then you realise that they are not so random. You feel the same way to all random people and it pains you, and boy would you like to help them out. You see the true suffering they go through, nowadays its possible to get all sorts of information. This is there with every single human being, although their effort is limited by their H&B's. And now you know that these people need all the help they can get. A couple of people are goin cray to help them, but it is not enough. Not if you see the suffering continueing. You need to do a lot. You need to do a lot more.

 My DAD for example, helps out a lot of people in th ecommunity, he likes doing it, when someone is ill he is the first one at the hospital and stuff. He likes doing it, but he also cares about it. If someone doens't have a job within the family he tries to help out etc... All these exmaples show us the thing that my DAD actually wants to help. But talk about people somewhere else in the world and money for them, bitch acts wierd. His rules state that you should help someone you know. WTF! He has helped other people he didnt know. And so on, lot of inconsistancies can be spotted.

You see that you feel the same way towards random people.

Also get this. You have been very lucky to be in a state like this. It just happened that you don't have to fight for food, water shelter and my oh my health care. It's not a meritocratic society. Not everyone is born with the same thing, to develop themseles. Please do not blame it on the people.  Anyways, in socialistic countries, we see people paying a lot of tax, even upto 50% that goes to people who earn less, so that they can live rather decently. There is health care for all at the same price or the rich pay more. The idea being that anyone can get diseases. Some treatments are costly AF. We share the burden, not everyone is going to be sick at the same time. we there by offset costs and help out each other in return as well. But the rich people can afford it, but the poor people will never be able to afford it. Does that mean they should be allowed to die? Its surprising how man-made boundries, dictate who gets health care and who not. Suddenly theose man-made boundries constitute a group of people who are known as 'X' and those people and only those people shall be taken care off. Why, why not exclude some people there, you know just for fucks sake,

#### proof of peole showing glimpses
Humans of bombay

My friends donating to a random charity in myanmar or something just because  a friend was there.

millap

I am sure those people would praise me, at least for a brief small period if they knew I was doing something in EA.

I weep bitch

friend donating 75 euros, withou second thought

many people donating huge loads of money




But they are doing it

#### Explain the anamolies then

I fear my logic is straight up shit. I need to clarify that by writing.


Telmo, no to xgf

ramesh says I happily watch goats being killed

giermo says, how can I let go of my dream to buy an audi to spend bucks on useless cunts.

How to know you are not being played by H&B's? How to knwo,, what are the tests you can do considering the above

#### Notes on other things

Monday:
180 words to write 22 mins left #pnn
~800 excluding some sopied stuff in 1 hr. Peaceful. Didn't stop there. thoguh.. wrote another x words. Didn't necessarily wan't to put the laptop down. did after 5 more mins. 1555-200 words even... 950 words. Let's see average!
Wifi shut.
Monday: Feeling good. Although wasted time with other things majorly (cooking etc...)

Tuesday:
starting at 1171

1 hr is not usually 1 hr. There is some prep time 10- 15 mins. Before we jump into writing in full capacity. I agree, this doens't feel like an exam. I suspect I am maybe 80-90% at full capacity. I have to see time now and then to know how far I have gone. When I have done quite well, I seem to relax, perhaps just like in an exam.

I can;t remember the last time I wrote 1.7k in less than 2 hrs without hardly any breaks, never used so little time I think. And the most important thing is the feel. No stress, no feeling of sleepyness max. Just when I start, it comes and goes.

~ 638 not counting the notes 22 mins to spare. Lot of repitition but so what! We write to clarify ideas.

Wednesday: Hard day as content generation becomes harder, having said other things that were easy.
45 mins down. The STM story connection to EA was impotant, got it from writing.

Thursday: 3269

576 22mins to gehen.

you cannot deny, that the things that I came up with are not the magic of writing.

AS PG says, expect 80% of the ideas to come when youare writing. My good ness put the burden on writing, not on you throught the day or some shit.

I kept saying in the start of writing. I felt excieted and scared to write, I kept saying I am going to compose my 5th symphony. I am quite relaxed having done my work for today.
