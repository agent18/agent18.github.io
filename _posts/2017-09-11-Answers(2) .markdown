#### Highlights from 'Answers' made last week

Last week we starte the 'Answers' series to the 'Questions' post.

>A Socrates can never be convinced about magic. He either has the magic a.k.a, the primary/basic rules, or not.

>You cannot convince a rock, you cannot convince an infinitely powerful computer about south sudan, or a very very smart dog that can talk.

>We have these primary rules, somehow. We can use them to understand the territory better. Initially we thought, blacks should be slaves, women should not have equal right, but then slowly, we discover that they are also just people like us. And then we modify our understanding of the rules. So, we have primary rules somehow, and we can use them to improve our understanding of our rules.

> It appears that as these rules cannot be taught to you- as they are not convincible to someone who doesn't have that rule- the only place possble to receive it from is like from our "father", Evolution, just like how we carry characteristics in our genes.

We have answered the 'basic' questions from the 'Questions' post, mostly off of the 1st discussion with an STM.

#### Rules

>  Shouldn't everyone have the same values? Then Why do terrorists exist? When will Achilles be wrong

Does everyone have the same primary rules?

I believe that most of the people have the basic/primary rules that we have been talking about in the last essay. These being:

> If A => B is accepted, then if A happens, then B can be inferred. (intellectual rule)
> Look at evidence to decide what the reality will be like (intellectual rule)
> When people are suffering we should help them (value rule)

Without Modes Ponens, I suppose education would be really hard, or for that matter communication. Evidence based understanding is there everywhere. It's in science religion literally everywhere. But there is a catch, the understanding of evidence seems to differ (#PNN). Will come to that in a bit. Recently, I joined a group on fb that was debating about flat earth and globe earth. The earth is not flat(let's not get into the details of it). But Flat Earthers, made wild claims, and supported every claim with some sort of evidence. To me suprisingly, they had answers for every single question posed by the Globians as we are called. They also looked at evidence, they also had this subjective probability. No surprise that ALL these FE's were Christians, they went out of thier way to make the bible right. Bible is right and from there they bounced with finding "evidence" to fit it. In theory, we have the same rules, but somehow something went wrong.


Peter Singer writes in [Famine, Affluence and ...][], "I suppose, most of them would want to save a drowning baby, even if it means that you get your clothes dirty". Time and again we see several people donating money because it pains them to see others suffer. Although they don't take it to the logical conclusion. Let's for now say that it is due to some H&B's misfiring. But it appears that the rule still holds for most of us. 'Suffering is bad'.

Looking at the 3 rules for now we know it appears that with some decent confidence we can say that most people have the same/similar rules (!).

Interesting. But then why do Terrorists exist?

#### But why do terrorists exist if we all have the same basic rules

Hmmm. Our rules tell us what we want. We don't know the exact rules, aka the true solution in the head. We don't know the reality the territory completely. As an STM said in [this post][], your understanding of the solution in the head (current SITH), is very wague. Initially you have a rought map, nothing to scale, some mountains and some water marked here and there. This would correspond to 'don't kill each other', 'help people who are dying', ' help each other to survive and procreate'. But then you can use these rules to understand more about the rules, and discover more of the reality and mark for your reference in the map.

>It is like a rough map of some terrain. Initially, it just marks out some hills and a river (“Don’t kill me, I won’t kill you. Let’s hunt together”). Nothing is to scale. There are vast parts unmarked (“how to treat women, blacks, gays, etc.”). Then, as we gain more and more knowledge, we fill in the vaguer parts of the map (“Ah! Black people are basically just like me. It is wrong to treat them like slaves”)

So not all rules are clear to us, our map is currently shit. It has very basic stuff.  As we saw last week, we are able to change our understanding of the rules, by reasoning, looking at evidence, using methods that show they work every time etc... One of the understanding of the rules changed in the past for me was religion. It just didn't hold up to the questions asked. We need to really put in some effort to understand better and act accordingly despite what we might feel is right (owing to H&B's). It appears that this is where shit went cray. Terrorists, republicans and democrats #pnn. We have this amazing thing called H&B. These were probably a mechanism to bridge the billion rules and billion facts that we would need to process. H&B's are to be undertood as shortcuts. They might have worked well for small problems back in the days, but right now they massively back fire, with [circular preferences][], misinterpretation of the true SITH, etc...

H&B's such as social proof, social conditioning etc... can really twist the understanding of a persons SITH. It was very easy to believe in religion. We might think we are doing something right. Screwed up logic can sound pefect. We are not trained to critically analyse what people say to us, the anologies they make and how it affects us. Imagine a small kid, growing up with terrorists. Reading the kuran every single day, being told that death is the penalty for , conservative views about how womne should dress and interpretting the saying that, "the world should have only muslims" too literally to the extent that he doesn't mind even giving up his life. Also, When so many people believe around you that the KURan is the word of allah, why would you believ otherwise? We have a H&B called social proof. #PNN man. Get this! If the same kid was brought up else where he would have different world views. When you see from a high level, you see that the kid is same, but his surroundings make him understand his SITH very differently. However, it appears to be possible that everyone can come to similar ideas in the end, if they followed a rigourous, scientific process of understanding themselves, and the things around them. When you are ready for change, when evidence strongly points that your understanding is wrong, I don't see much problem. Change is hard, change is painful. Change is possibel. Everyone does it. I did it an STM did it. So many people have done it. Basically understanding the rules. I say similar ideas because, Even though Eliezer and Robin hanson have the same end goal, 'better prospering of mankind', both differ in their way of handling the problem, in some aspects. It's hard for everyones subjective probability to completly align. I suspect this is the reason. To a point its all numbers very distinctive and straightforward, but then after that. Our powers are still finite.

Compared to the terrorist look at me, standing in the umbrella with an STM, am thinking about completely different things. To a point it is social proof but then when evidence based learning is preached every second of the choir, I suspect that we are quite different form the religious people, who cannot in any circumstance give it up.

For me what to do in life, has changed mighty much. Initially, just like the herd it was 'being successful, getting lot of money and bitches', then it moved on to 'god', then, 'tim ferrises 4 hr work week and about taking constant mini-retirements, giving less of a fuck about making more money', 'PUA', and then random stuff for a while, and then back to this.

An stm said this last weekend, and I quite agree with him.

>People might say, "you are fickle minded, you can't stick to one thing. You are easily convinced. You don't stand your ground. You keep changing, Now you are saying no to marriage, later you will marry, you just can't make up your mind". In the end we need to understand that it is they who have the problem. Changing based on evidence, is nothing short of a good thing. Its they who think they somehow got it right on the first try, its they who seem to need a kick on their asses. Look at this whole population that is marrying. Despite all the evidence and them not even considering it. Just falling for it to go with the herd behaviour for some reaosn (H&B, I might add)

Why am I right? Bitch
Sceince? Tot morgen

Conclusion:
We have basic rules (the ones that need no convincing) "dont kill", "Live long", "Follow modes ponens", etcetera. From which we formulate more rules, "relgion might be true", or "there seems to be no way in hell that religion might be true". Then people informed me that the way I had gotten into religion was not scientific. So what if it is not scientic? Then You went deeper. You realised that the evidence the religious people provided didn't hold up to the science at all. You update your rules, regarding how to look at evidecnce. You use your current understanding of the rules, and it seems possible to get a better understadning of the rules. I still continue to say rules becuase, the funtamental rule that answres how to understand evidence, was not just changed, but shaken AF bitch.

This gives me confidence that there is something is happening to my understanding, based on my current understanding.

This one rule discussed above can make such a difference. The difference between terrosim and anti-terrorism (if thats a thing) I guess.

Also, many people have migrated from relgion, what happend in their cases. Why did their understanding of the rules change and why did they come out of their religion, depsite a lot of social pressure. Understanding of evidence.

So achilles goes wrong when his understanding of the rules go cray.

#### Story so far



Now what?

#### How to understand what we truly want?
The thing that I have learned until now s that We have rules, which are wague. Their understanding can be changed by using the current understanding of the rules.  I cannot be convinced about south sudan, or for that matter modes ponens.

We have feelings, which give us an indication of what we might want, but then they are circular. Feelings are primarily (to my knowledge) operated by the mighty H&B's. This is where the confusion comes. becuase the data we have is after H&B's. If that is the case, and if we know some of the important H&B's, is it possible to derive from there what will be the actual rule? WHat will be the actual value system?

We have some data, as a result of H&B. This data is filter on our rules. We don't know what our true rules are. We hope to get to the rules say by addin a negative filter to the H&B, having been able to understand several of these. Atleast sticking to the most important ones.

#### Discuss H&B's
Let's look at scope sensitivity and see what we can do with it, and how to reverse it etc...

#### Notes on other things

Monday:
180 words to write 22 mins left #pnn
~800 excluding some sopied stuff in 1 hr. Peaceful. Didn't stop there. thoguh.. wrote another x words. Didn't necessarily wan't to put the laptop down. did after 5 more mins. 1555-200 words even... 950 words. Let's see average!
Wifi shut.
Monday: Feeling good. Although wasted time with other things majorly (cooking etc...)

Tuesday:
starting at 1171

1 hr is not usually 1 hr. There is some prep time 10- 15 mins. Before we jump into writing in full capacity. I agree, this doens't feel like an exam. I suspect I am maybe 80-90% at full capacity. I have to see time now and then to know how far I have gone. When I have done quite well, I seem to relax, perhaps just like in an exam.

I can;t remember the last time I wrote 1.7k in less than 2 hrs without hardly any breaks, never used so little time I think. And the most important thing is the feel. No stress, no feeling of sleepyness max. Just when I start, it comes and goes.

~ 638 not counting the notes 22 mins to spare. Lot of repitition but so what! We write to clarify ideas.
