## Feedback

Mr. Agent,

Great job on spending 29 hours in a week! I recommend measuring rate
of phrases per hour.

Excellent. A failed scenario.

"Good enough" could mean that the amount of entertainment and feeling
of satisfaction you get from them in your free time is enough for you
to not search for something more. If it had been a salt-less plate of
biriyani, you would not have said the same.

I see lots of failed scenarios regarding marriage.

What to do with the failed scenarios? What is the pattern here? For
example, with statements with **because** which we don't respond to we
identify the pattern with the presence of the work **because**.

This is a predicate based on his beliefs about what is right and
wrong, not on empirical examples. "Crime does not pay" is a predicate
about the world and it would be false if the average crime led to a
lot of money without imprisonment. "Crime **should** not pay" can be
skipped for now. ("The Holy B says that crime should not pay" is
testable, though.)

Good job! If you failed here, you can note down this pattern "X
prefers A to B", so that you can focus on it in the future and stop
making that mistake. Just like you would focus on two-digit
multiplication if that's where you have failed in the past. For
example, "a certain Agent prefers not marrying to marrying or not
having kids to having kids".

"But I don't have any examples of the case where the aforementioned
Agent has kids!" -- Ask the people selling this to you for smaller
claims that you can test right now, such as "you will like holding a
baby" or "changing a diaper ain't all that bad" or "people don't get
too upset when their kids disobey them".

We fail when STM tells we are wrong, or when we fail to match the
subject to the predictate for example, when we take time to identify
that a claim needs no example.

Nice. If this took you time, note down the pattern "doing more of X
will help" so that you can search for similar scenarios on which to
practice.

> Not sure if something is a running example (atleast 8/133 claims)

Are you using the same example for the same subject? For example, PG
might claim many things about schleps (subject), such as most people
don't take it on and it can be quite valuable. Did you use the same
example of Stripe (running example)?

> Hard to give example, more time more research needed? (39/133
> claims)

Mark the claim as lacking an example. Unless it's something you care
about a lot, you don't need to spend too much time searching for an
example (like the case of prison labor stats).

Overall, I didn't see you take on Superintelligence, which was the
mission. Please work on either that or stuff you feel confused
about. Only failures matter (apart from maintenance of existing
performance).

Note down patterns of failure, such as "X prefers A to B". Spend, say,
half your time searching for and practicing on examples of those
types. You can spend the rest of your practice time on new examples,
from which you will hopefully find other patterns of failure.

Best,


## Lessons learn't summary

Count phrases per hour? or claims per hour!

An STM keeps saying there are patterns and that similar patterns are
the same... 

For example, an STM claims that X prefers marriage to no marriage is
the same pattern as 


ok so what he is suggesting to identify is the english pattern? with X
prefers A or B that seems to be the case.

But what i do with 


"doing something More or less is what weare going for"

Is something a running example?


Goal identify patterns of failure from predicate subject markdown.


There are a lot of failure scenarios within marriag posts claims an
STM.
