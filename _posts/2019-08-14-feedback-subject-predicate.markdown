## Feedback

Mr. Agent,

Great job on spending 29 hours in a week! I recommend measuring rate
of phrases per hour.

Excellent. A failed scenario.

"Good enough" could mean that the amount of entertainment and feeling
of satisfaction you get from them in your free time is enough for you
to not search for something more. If it had been a salt-less plate of
biriyani, you would not have said the same.

I see lots of failed scenarios regarding marriage.

This is a predicate based on his beliefs about what is right and
wrong, not on empirical examples. "Crime does not pay" is a predicate
about the world and it would be false if the average crime led to a
lot of money without imprisonment. "Crime **should** not pay" can be
skipped for now. ("The Holy B says that crime should not pay" is
testable, though.)

Good job! If you failed here, you can note down this pattern "X
prefers A to B", so that you can focus on it in the future and stop
making that mistake. Just like you would focus on two-digit
multiplication if that's where you have failed in the past. For
example, "a certain Agent prefers not marrying to marrying or not
having kids to having kids".

"But I don't have any examples of the case where the aforementioned
Agent has kids!" -- Ask the people selling this to you for smaller
claims that you can test right now, such as "you will like holding a
baby" or "changing a diaper ain't all that bad" or "people don't get
too upset when their kids disobey them".

Nice. If this took you time, note down the pattern "doing more of X
will help" so that you can search for similar scenarios on which to
practice.

> Not sure if something is a running example (atleast 8/133 claims)

Are you using the same example for the same subject? For example, PG
might claim many things about schleps (subject), such as most people
don't take it on and it can be quite valuable. Did you use the same
example of Stripe (running example)?

> Hard to give example, more time more research needed? (39/133
> claims)

Mark the claim as lacking an example. Unless it's something you care
about a lot, you don't need to spend too much time searching for an
example (like the case of prison labor stats).

* * * * *

Overall, I didn't see you take on Superintelligence, which was the
mission. Please work on either that or stuff you feel confused
about. Only failures matter (apart from maintenance of existing
performance).

Note down patterns of failure, such as "X prefers A to B". Spend, say,
half your time searching for and practicing on examples of those
types. You can spend the rest of your practice time on new examples,
from which you will hopefully find other patterns of failure.

Best,

STM

## Failures 

**Total claims**: 122 

**Total Failures**: ~35 (Wow!)

## Failures category 1:  patterns 1 

**Claim made by self with 0 ex**: *self-claim-with-0-ex* 

**Claims**: Kids SUCK

*I spent quite some time, wondering why I hated kids so much. Not one
repulsive example came to my mind*

**failures**: 6

Failed here by not being able to give examples to my own claims.

---

**Claims about the future without any example**: *future-with-no-ex* 

**Claims**: Human civilization is at stake

**failures**: 0/6

Do not seem to have failed here. I seem to have spotted the ones which
were claims of the future and didn't have examples.

---

**Claims with because should due-to**: *because-should-due-to* 

**Claims**: Crime should not pay

**failures**: 5/7 atleast

I seem to have been unsure or have failed in cases where I should not
bother with giving examples for now. 

---

**Claims with must**: *must* 

**Claims**: Being able to save lives must be very satisfying

*I don't know if I can give an example or if I can't give an example
for must.*

**failure**: 1/1

---

**Often**: *often* 

**Claims**: It is often not the case that prisoners who fire fight are
learning skills that will help them get a job outside. 

**failure**: 1/3 atleast

My answer with and without often looks exactly the same. I don't know
how to give an example for often

---

## Failure category 2: patterns 2

**Claim with "A is important"**

**Claims**: I have important things to do in life (and hence cannot
marry)

*Look at the example I gave*

**Example**: I have spent roughly 500 hrs over one year on Concrete
thinking and still struggle with ten phrases an hour.

*Having trouble with proving something is important*

**failure**: 3/4 atleast

---

**X prefers A to B**

> Many prisoners prefer to do jobs, instead of having to sit in their
> cells all day

*It took me time to realize that this doesn't have an example in the
video I was watching*

**failure**: 1/1 (time)

---

**Missed the comparison**

**Claims**: Getting married is [12].

**Subject**: Being Married

**Predicate**: is [12].

**Example**: The great Eliezer Yudkowsky, Paul Graham, Bill Gates,
Vishwanath Anand are all married. 

*Here I should have compared for example what Eliezer is and would
have been if he was not married or sumpin in that context. But I
didn't*

**failure**: 2/2 atleast

---

**Missed if**

> If you really have not a (better thing to do in life)[1] and choose to
> (“settle down” and marry)[2], good luck bruv.

**Claims**: It's a bad idea to [2], because you have not
anything [1].

**Correct claim**: It's a bad idea to [2], if you do not have [1].

*missed if mis-interpreting because*

**failure**: 1/1 atleast

---

**belief**

> (Crime)[0] should (not pay)[1], is (very simple common sense)[2].

**Claims**: Crime should not pay is [2].

*This has no examples as it is a belief*

**failure**: 1/1 atleast

---

**Cannot identify running**

*I will factor this in, from the next practice.*

## Failure category 2: Subject predicate example definition


**Claims with example not matching definition**

**Claims**: crime does not pay

*Didn't know how the example would look keeping the definition in mind*

**failure**: 2/3

---

**Claims where the definition was unclear**

> I have (my parents, my brother and a whole lot of friends and
> cousins)[14].

**Claims**: I have [14] and that is good enough.

*I didn't know what good enough could mean.*

**failure**: 6/9 atleast

In addition to failure, it also takes time. Usually when I read these
statements, it takes "time" to come to the point where I just give
up. I spend time reading the predicate over and over again, and
ultimately just give up.

---

**Claims where the subject predicate split is not right**

> (it)[1] cannot be (an intellectual debate among Democrats)[2]. We
> have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly."

**Claims**: [1] cannot be [2].

**Subject**: Discussion amongst Democrats

**Predicate**: cannot be intellectual

**Correct Subject**: The solution to the busing problem

**Correct Predicate**: cannot be an intellectual debate among
democrats

**failure**: 2/2 atleast

---

**Claims where I am unsure if it is an example**

> (the problem)[2] is (a research challenge worthy of the next
> generation’s best mathematical talent)[3]

**Claims**: [2] is [3].

**Example**: AI control problem

*Not sure if this is an example*

**failure**: 1/120 atleast

---

**Claims where I am unsure if it has an example**

**Claims**: crime does not pay

**Subject**: What crime does.

**Predicate**: does not pay.

**Example**: !!

*Was unsure if it can have an example. Based on the feedback from an
STM, I recognize that it should have an example* "it would be false if
the average crime led to a lot of money without imprisonment".

**failure**: 4/120 atleast

--- 

## Conclusion

As per the advice of an STM, it would be wise to take up these
failures and reduce them for each pattern.

## Partial Work Stats

Statistics while identifying failed scenarios
