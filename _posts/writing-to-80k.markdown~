## In what ways did it affect you or your career plans?

I spent a full year in 2017-2018 on 80k's website coming up with what
was best for my career.  And after a year, ended up discarding the
research I compiled based on your website. Why? Because I was made to
realize that I had compiled info based on ENGLISH. Based on things
that I thought I understood. I explain below:

1. Tons and tons of claims but where is the evidence?

Claims on your site are too vague I just don't understand them. I
thought I understood them until I came across EA forum where my world
just completely toppled over. This goes from understanding how
competitive the EA orgs are, to Talent constrained to replaceability
etc... I wrote about Talent constraint ([agent 18 on EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but))
there after. I have massive issues with the way you represent
replaceability. And I am tired of how you think you can just make
broad unverifiable claims and get away with it. Example below so you
understand what I am talking about.

**Claim:** "If you get involved in the community, and prove your interest
and general competence, there’s a **decent chance** you’ll be able to find
a role regardless of your qualifications and experience."

Do you have an example for making such a claim? Who are you talking
about? What is "prove your interest", "what is decent chance", What
the does "regardless" mean? 

The wording "regardless of qualifications and experience, decent
chance" foolishly made me (and others I guess) expect that HEART
(surrendering everything to the cause) is all that it took to get into
EA. That is surely not the case.

This one example however was enough for me to come back to
reality. That is the POWER OF EXAMPLES. Guy named "EA Applicant" makes
a post on EA forum. He applied to 20 jobs. He didn't get a single job,
neither did his friends who he claims had the "right" characteristics
and yet didn't get jobs. It was "that competitive" I realized after
looking at examples and his CV. How only 4% of "good" people who
applied got into Open Phil (Open Phil 2018 hiring round) or for that
matter Charity entrepreneurship (1%), or GiveWell or EAF baffles me
while 80000hours continues to chant "Talent constrained slogan",
baffles me. Of course I didn't realize this until I burnt my fingers
at the beginning of this year when I saw the posts on EA forum about
REALITY or more clearly, CONCRETE EXAMPLES.

I really wish to make a plea to you to PLEASE USE EXAMPLES and not
JUST ENGLISH to convey what you want to say. I know you can't provide
statistics but examples on how you think, why you make claims the way
you do, would be really helpful if people were looking at your website
to actually take action.

People might say "it makes sense", oh "I understand it", but what do
they even mean with "understanding" it. 

The keyideas post has so many tons of claims. I have the option of
accepting it blindly (thinking that I understand it), rejecting it or
verifying it with an example atleast and ending up spending way too
much time. Instead I find EA forum, talking to people in the bizz much
more useful. I have sadly refrained from looking at the OPINION posts
(mainly 80k) that are beyond being questioned unlike in the EA FORUM
where there is a chat at the bottom and that chat is active.

You are neither reachable for comment nor did I get any info when I
tried once to clarify what in something meant that you wrote on your
blog regarding Data Science.

By not providing more evidence you are basically claiming that you are
the authority on the subject. You are basically asking me and people
like me to take it or leave it. Even taking it is hard as mentioned
above cause I have no idea what you are talking about.

### AI

"At every national security and technology conference that 80,000
Hours has attended, speakers have lamented the government’s lack of
expertise on AI, and noted the substantial demand for such expertise
within government. For example, DoD’s new Joint AI Center alone is
apparently looking to hire up to 200 people." ---[AI policy 80k](https://80000hours.org/articles/us-ai-policy/)

What exactly are the speakers lamenting about. What exactly are they
missing? What type of people are they missing? POLICY is a word that
encompasses tons of things. Would be helpful to get answers to the
questions above. So that people can actually take action.

DOD's JAIC seems to have hired 10 people in total in POLICY over the
last two years according to Linkedin. 80000hours says 200 people were
needed by JAIC on the whole, which seems to indicate a wrong order of
magnitude about the number of AI policy people needed. 

You keep saying there is a "huge" demand for AI policy people.

**Claims**: There are a lot of jobs currently(last 3 months) for AI
Policy in Govt. and Academia.

This is me verifying what "lot of jobs" actually means: So I saw only
about [10 jobs identified as per 80000hours job board](https://80000hours.org/job-board/ai-safety-policy/) between
March and May including all types of senior roles, non-profits and
interns too that had to do with Policy. I know you can't cover all the
jobs that are there in the world. But I guess you covered the
"important" ones. Are we talking about 40 jobs per year or 400 or
4000?

Maybe you can list all the govt departments and how many each dept. is
expected to hire in the comnig years. Some quantitative feel more than
"speakers lamented in every govt about lack of AI expertise" is highly
appreciated. 

## Vagueness in EA survey, career capital and more.

So the survey is supposed to inform us of what we need more of. I am
not even going to get into the validity of the survey or the use of
questions like, "Do people think their organization is Talent
constrained". 

When I see GRs are needed according to the survey I know GRs such as
in Open Phil or any of the other EA orgs, is what is needed. If they
say operations people are missing, then I think they need people like
Tanya to run EA orgs. Simple. Let me not even get into what "need
people like" means.

But when people say "one-on-one" skills, it could mean many things:
talking to politicians about causes (policy people maybe), People who
are good at convincing people changing their career path (career
counselors), it could also mean fundraisers in the front line bringing
the big bucks. I am sure we can think of other things as well. So what
is it that people in the survey meant? everything? Why not just say,
"we need policy people with good social skills instead". At least this
way the community knows what you are missing "exactly" rather than
allowing it to interpretation. This way, people can act on it. What
"good social skills" means? Well let's not get into that discussion as
well. If I and the surveyors could be provided with one example, like
`Tanya for FHI` --> operations people, it makes things concrete and
people exactly know what the survey is talking about. AGAIN EXAMPLES
ARE REALLY REALLY USEFUL.

I am not a big fan of these broad terminologies as they don't allow ME
to act on them. Case in point: "Best ways to gain Career Capital (CC)
are: Work at a growing organisation that has a reputation for high
performance; Getting a graduate degree; Working in Tech sector; Taking
a data science job; Working in think tanks; Making "good connections",
Having runway etc... " **Literally everything under the sun.** We
would like actionable insights. 

I am unable to act on it. I could in theory pursue everything. I don't
know how to compare which has **higher CC and lower CC.** The
definition says: "CC puts you in a better position to make a
difference in the future, including skills, connections, credentials
and runway." When I work in Data Science in a FAANG job do I have
higher CC compared to when I work in computer science degree? I don't
know. Even taking skills, Option A gives me computer skills and Option
B gives me leadership skills? Seriously how do I compare? No one
knows. It's just vague. Whereas if we talk about salary or some other
concrete things then things are verifiable again. So please show us
the right metrics to compare.

Economists routinely measure the impact of high-school dropout vs
high-school diploma vs some years of college but dropout vs undergrad
degree vs grad degree, in different fields, using the variable "median
weekly earnings" or "lifetime earnings". So when someone says, "you
need a degree to get ahead in life", I can imagine what they mean $470
weekly wage increase. Whereas when someone says, "Computer Science PhD
is good CC", I am lost beyond words. Contrast that to saying "Best
ways to gain CC is by looking at earnings". Then I could look at
median earnings for Data Science Faang job vs Phd in computer science
in say top 20 university (based on my capability) and get ahead in
life.

## Replaceability

The way you have covered replaceability is a back in 2017 atleast was
really vague and not thorough. I believed you back then. Now I have
completely flipped a 180 thanks to EA forum. Last I remember seeing
replaceability articles from you was [here](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#but-wont-i-be-replaceable).

So your article just says "the other person you replace will go on to
do something high-impact". This is so vague. No cases are specified.
Again, I could either trust your claim blindly or reject it or verify
it.

Imagine you had dealt with it like [this](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EP8x3vHRQJP57TjFL/the-counterfactual-impact-of-agents-acting-in-concert) as was done in the EA
forum with TONS OF EXAMPLES. Halstead motivates how to understand
"counterfactual" impact and gives tons of examples and I am a happy
man who can actually use this in my CEA calculations.

Here is another article on [SHAPELY](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHZJ9i7QBtAJZ6byW/shapley-values-better-than-counterfactuals ). Its ok to be open ended, it
is ok to say we are not sure. But acting like the authority on
something and delivering such poor output opinion level posts is not
appreciated.

## Advice from 80k

I found somewhere that you had asked to do our own lifetime
calculations of impact by asking orgs about how much money they would
be willing to give up instead of hiring us and things like that. I
hate this advice because many orgs I contacted couldn't bother to help
me with this (Open Phil, etc...). Why would 80000hours ask people to
do this? when they have the most power and can request orgs for
estiamtes about thier own employee.




## If you remember, which parts of the website played an important
role? Do you remember any specific articles?

There is a post by EA applicant: 
I made a post on Talnet contrained here:
https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z9x56yiX2ceRZnKTR/a-naive-analysis-on-if-ea-is-talent-constrained



## Are there things you wish we’d done differently?
