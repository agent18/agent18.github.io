## Where should you work (done)

This is clear I think. Has to be in a hub if you wanna be great and
	have less distractions and focus on the one you need.

## DW is better than ETG (should be easy to finish)

So it appears that working as in DW is similar to working in an ETG
comparing the impact in terms of donations. For example if you consider
working as an investment banker in a top firm or a trader, average
earnings of [650k<span>$</span>](https://80000hours.org/2017/05/how-much-do-hedge-fund-traders-earn/) seems to be possible. Assuming a
50% donation that is about 325k<span>$</span>.

On the other hand if we look at the average contribution per year of
an EAO worker according to the survey [here](https://80000hours.org/2018/10/2018-talent-gaps-survey/#ea-leaders-are-willing-to-sacrifice-a-lot-of-extra-donations-to-hold-on-to-their-most-recent-hires) of some of the "top
EAO's", we see that junior hires on average are worth
88k<span>$</span> and senior hires at 333k<span>$</span>. Taking an
average among these is 288k<span>$</span>.

It thus seems that both would lead me to impact in the same ball
park. Of course there are a lot of probabilities to take into
account. One such probability is the possibility to grow to become the
ultimate trader who can earn

What deters me away from working in banking or trading is the Stress
levels and how people feel, the need to do an MBA and the growth
related probabilities. More on this on another post.

But the summary seems to be that I need to excel, seemingly in an EAO.


So, DW is better than ETG. So we want to work in ETG rather than
trying our hand at ETG. The best ETG can potentially match the impact
of DW. 

And DW seems much more easy to get into rather than ETG. It doesn't
seem to be the most stressful and if you look at people working in DW
for example GiveWell, then you know it is not really impossible when
people with history background get into it. 



## What should I do in EAO

I have seen the example of David Roodman and his work in EAO's. He
from being a replication data scientist has moved to understanding
global prorities.

I don't know what is hot and expect the world around me to tell me
once I start "networking" with the boys. Milan Griffes worked in
GiveWell and then moved to Ought. No one stayed in the same place for
more than 2-5years which says no amount of planning is going to
help. I hope to move in the general direction, i.e., EAO, so that from
there on GOD takes over.

Anyways. I saw this survey by 80khours on the type of people
needed. There was MI engineers, Computer scientists, management people
and Generalist researchers. With the top being... So I look at this
need and say that I am going to become a GR But maybe if I sent an
email to 80khours GiveWell and ask them what kind of people are they
personally constrained by.... that is what I should focus on becoming
right? 

Makes sense. Right direction I guess. So where is the survey what does
it actually say?


I think I can be anything I am what Gotham needs me to be. 

Like if you wanna get into operations then I could possibly switch
here, nam saying... 


I don't know other organizations I could ask. 


I don't need to go into something that is in huge demand.

Of course I think it would be good to master statistics, understand
how to value animals vs people etc... 

Apparently 80khours says starting low places you well for advanced
positions well? Do you know  any senior researchers, who have come up?


GR, Management or operations and ML/AI engineering? Survey says, but I
understand I need to look at something that is talent constrained and
get there. So I can call or ask these places what type of skill do
they feel constrained by. 

STM is not trying to work at MIRI or trying to be awesome so that one
day he can study at MIRI.

Write an Email to 80khours, Open Phil and also look at the lecture by
80khours on this topic, talent constrained.

I worry they are not going to allow me to take over CEA like they
allowed Tara macaulay. I am afraid I have 0 accolades. I could work
elsewhere but it is unclear what gets you where.

If I start something maybe it is too late, well maybe not.

It doens't really suck to start afresh post 30 except the time I have
to do stuff will be low?

But there aren't any GR vacancies on 80khours recent openings!!!


### The survey

There is a survey on 80khours that they do every year. In 2018 the
survey reports the following skills needed:

What I am worried about here is that this only shows what they need,
if the demand is already being met, is there a "lot" of competition
for it is unclear.

I hereby make a claim that I should not work where there is lot of
competition. My reasoning is that, there will somehow be better people
to work on the same thing. Right now I suck. I need to work on
something that allows me to work really well in a talent constrained
region. But Why? 

Should I look at talent constrained or some number that says where
there will be most demand? Ideally I think I need to multiply impact
of each position (such as management) with my personal fit.

But I am trying to maximize my impact or global impact? my impact then
I would need to work in 


**How to choose where to work?**

I don't kno.  Looking at what is in demand deosn't seem to be a good
way (claim). Choosing arbitratily also doesn't seem like a good way to
make a decision. What we want is to have high impact and work in the 

What is also interesting is the key bottlenecks for the EA community,
as that is the gap we want to fill in.


Assumption working in all EAO's is a good start

**Claims**: choose work based on demand

**Claims**: choose work based on which area is constrained

**Claims**: working in opearations when talent is constrained or not
enough people are available

For me I think I can contribute in operations (people from philosophy
do it), GR (I will work my ass off in writing and statistics for this)
or management or AI even. Tell me you need me there, I will work my
ass off that is it. EVEN AI there are ways, and I think I can follow
those verbatim and work my ass off. Just that if there is too much
competition then I don't think I will get in as a newbie. Claims
claims claims yes. 

So I want to leave things like AI strategy etc.. etc... for now. First
start somewhere and then see where to go. Time is ticking. In fact
give myself 6 months to find my job in Givewell type orgs. And see
where it takes me.. Plus AI strategy omg, I tried reading SI and
couldn't but feel sleepy sloppy because of it.

Worst case I don't know what to do. In the worst case I will have to
come back and not sure what I will do,,, I will be 35 when I am back I
guess. Can I pick up DS?

or would I have to start with DS then jump to EAO and then in case it
tanks or I am unable to go further I can atleast do DS and fund shit!

I am afraid of this whole 30 thing. Need to find that research and
understand what it means. Done. It's not too bad.

how much is a research analyst worth?
https://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/05/givewells-progress-in-2015/

## Which EAO

Just start somewhere buddy. You are most likely not going to stay in
the same place for more than 2 years. + you get networking
opportunities and possibly understand where could be better working.

i.e., atleast take a step in the "right direction"?

## Will I get a job at EAO?
## How long before I make a decision?
### Picking up new skills post 30 (quick summary)

TOI says,

"One of the best established and least surprising findings in psy-
chology is that as we age, we slow down. Remembering things, solving
unfamiliar problems—these take about twice as long in our sixties as
they did in our twenties. We move more slowly. Coordinating our arms
and legs is more difficult. We've all seen it happen, and anyone in their
thirties or beyond has experienced it. So we might reasonably suppose
that this unavoidable trend spells doom for excellent performance. "

~~Unable to dig deeper as the citations need to be bought. 20 to 60 and
there is a decrease in skills tha~~

"Research reveals an answer that applies across fields. Studies in a
very broad range of domains—management, aircraft piloting, music,
bridge, and others—show consistently that excellent performers suffer
the same age-related declines in speed and general cognitive abilities
as everyone else—"

"Much of the research of aging cited here, including the research show-
ing that pianists suffer normal age-related declines except in
piano-related skills, is summarized in a chapter of the Cambridge
Handbook: Ralf Th. Krampe and Neil Charness, "Aging and Expertise.""

The account of Julio Franco's training regimen is in Ben Shpigel,
"Break- fast at Julio's," The New York Times, March 1, 2006, p. D1.
The quotation of Karl Malone is from an excellent general article on
aging athletes: Martin Miller, "Raising the Bar at 40," The Los
Angeles Times, September 29, 2003"

Suggesting reasons for why aging and expert level performance is still possible.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6110907/pdf/fphys-09-01100.pdf

Suggests that aging results in decrease in performance roughly
linearly for athletes.

Tiger Woods 44, Jerry Rice 42 (20 seasons as a wide receiver prone to
insane fights and running)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3383816/

Here it shows that reaction times increase as 

| AGE   | RT (ms) | variance (ms) |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 18-29 | 401     | 5-10          |
| 39-44 | 419     | 5-10          |
| 44-59 | 526     | 5-10          |
| 60-85 | 634     | 5             |

If I am reading the results right, then what I am seeing is the
decrease in skills like remembering triplets, But not by much.

I am still waiting for info on how bad new skill learning is at 30 40

ADULTS*

"Most results suggest that older adults require more time than younger
adults to acquire computer skills Charness, Schumann, & Boritz,
1992; Czaja & Sharit, 1993; Elias, Elias, Robbins, & Gage, 1987;
Hartley, Hartley, & Johnson, 1984; Zandri & Charness, 1989"

Havn't seen one example where this is elucidated. No one seems to talk
about learning a skill. except starting from Elias paper.

*Cambridge Handbook*

" average 50-year-old can attain a certain IQ score with
only 85–90 percent of the performance speed typical of an individual in her
early 20s."




^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


**Other forms of evidence**

When learning a program with Jerry and Christan, Christan clearly
seemed to be the leader. wheras Jerry still asks christan doubts.

When speaking to Rob, clearly he is slow as fuck,I just started and
overtook him and his capabilities in no time..

Roy also I have noticed that he is slow with some things. Can't
remember what but he was slow and I was like damn roy, is this really you?

The older guy who came to read at our Masters program. Slow and
useless. 

**How bad is it to learn a skill in 35's or 40's as compared to
30's?**

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3268226

https://booksc.xyz/book/60896083/a4b624

According to *Acquisition of word-processing skills by younger,
middle-age, and older adults.*

> The study included three age groups composed of 15 female subjects
> each: younger (A/ age - 2 1 . 5 years. SD - 3.5. range 18-28): middle
> age (M age -- 42.2 years. SD - 3.1, range = 37-481; and older (A/ age
> =- 60.7 years SD = 3.6, range = 55-67).

After roughly 21 hrs of training and excercises on word processing
with SuperSCRIPT, subjects took one final exam which was
timed. Earlier exams were also timed, but let's look at the last one.
Younger batch got a mean of 87 and the middle batch got a mean of 106,
i.e., 20% slower than the younger batch. The older batch were 68%
slower compared to the younger batch. This is an example of how slow
the mean learning of a person in the age of 37-48 could be.  It's not
bad at all. There is a wide amount of uncertainty expressed in S.D=28
mins. It is expected that when I am at 37 it could be much lower than 20%.

This is "consistent" (alteast in the order of magnitude) with IQ:

> The average 50-year-old can attain a certain IQ score with
> only 85–90 percent of the performance speed typical of an individual in her
> early 20s. --- Cambridge handbook

I could also look at the P-value in this case. but not
available. Atleast it is not too bad as with old people typically
seeing s


And people studying MBA are doing it later and later i.e.,

"Yes, the average age of incoming students at Harvard last year was 27,
but more than 10% had 7 or more years of experience, with a maximum
of 17. Columbia and UCLA Anderson both welcomed students in their 40s,
and though 28 seems to be the sweet spot across the top 20 US schools,
all of them have students with more than 10 years experience, with
over 15 years at Wharton and MIT Sloan. In Europe, where the profile
of MBA students trends a little older, top schools such as LBS,
INSEAD, HEC Paris and Cambridge Judge have an average age of 29, with
just over 7 years of work experience at IMD."

In the above case it should be noted they probably have an experience
and an MBA will propel them forward. Most likely it might not be a jump.

So I think the possibilities are "decent". With "little" change in
brain capabilities. Even if all hell breaks loose say at 35 (currently
28), It should be possible to do an MBA or worst case see data science
as an option... as learning seems to be not too affected (based on the
mean).

There is some slow down but it looks like it is not as bad as 1.4
times even.

And Of course I will be competing withe people who are much younger
and better, ummm, so ? Not sure. That is why it is useful to look at
someone who has done that and my oh my the internet is full of farts
who are "moving to DS" etc...

My cousin who is in her 40's did some exams and got a job as a payroll
processor in the US. She did chemical engineering masters in
IIT. Stopped working in 2000 and then moved to the US and managed to
get A job after 15 years without a job. 


## Is 65k enough?
## In case EAO doesn't work out
## The plan

So I prefer to work in an EAO. Cool. I know I need to be in the Bay
Area. Great! 

**Ask for help or career advice**

I tried axing 80khours and they shot me down. So maybe I can try again
or with specific questions approach a bunch of people.



## Overall story

**DW better than ETG**
So, DW is better than ETG. So we want to work in ETG rather than
trying our hand at ETG. The best ETG can potentially match the impact
of DW.

i.e., atleast take a step in the "right direction"?

**Where (area) should I be at?**

It appears that I should be in the silicon valley. 80khours moved to SV.

Every area produces a particular kind of people. Florence for example
for artists. Newyork for business men. Not a coincidence that all
banks have their HQ in NewYork. NAC that my friend went to NY to make
money in IB. It's called the New York Stock exchange.

What about  universities and acheivements in the field of research,
pretty much it seems to be scattered around.

Delft vs ASML

Silicon valley is the tech hub

people vs region/city

PG wouldn't fight such a force but use it to help himself instead.

## Overall story 2

So it is clear where I should go. I need to pursue good
persuasion. What else is clear is that DW  in many cases is better
than ETG. 

The hardest question I think is what to do in EAO's (there is a
survey, there is not). There is a job board. So how do I make the
case for where I should go into is STILL NOT CLEAR.

Which EAO is also not clear. But I don't think anyone knows. The
people I look at I see that they don't really stay in the same
EAO. And best of all once you make network, you can find your peace in
the system. So this is ok!

Will I get a job in EAO? depending on what I choose, I am unsure,
based on the article I came across.


**Money** Looking at the gross number of people who are apping, it
appears that money might not really be an issue? quickly look at it
bro... in terms or health, loss of job and savings for old age and in
case of injuries and cryonics. But I can maybe avoid this. 

**Is it ok to change and start fresh (as in a managerial role after 5
years)?**

Because I suspect growth type (So we check for post 30 skills gaining)

**The dreaded backup plans and current plans investigation**

- app and see to EAO's (includes prep and stuff)
- else DS master?
- or DS in ASML? 
- 

**The real questions**

1. What do I do in an EAO? <-- Start here.

2. Will I get a job in an EAO?

3. What to do in case of EAO doesn't work?

	In each case what is the visa plan for netherlands?  Chalk out
	rough plan bro.

4. Coping with being fired in an EAO? (postponed indefinitely)
   - is 65k enough? what about retirement finances related post

**DEADLINE:** common bro 2 weeks. Lets Go. 4 hrs on weekdays to get to
answers. Let's make a rough plan and see where it takes us.
