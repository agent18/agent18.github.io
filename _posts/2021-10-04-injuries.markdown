**middle quitting tabs**

didn't have all tabs or something

- loss of apetite
- nausea
- unable to eat
- unable to sleep full night even (for a few days)
- unable to do anything tired etc.

**medicines she takes now and current status**

- lonazep 0.5mg 1 per day in addition to tabs for cholesterol, 

- able to walk 50 mins - 1 hr everyday

- eating well

- sleeping

- very anxious 2-5 days onces, where she suddenly gets palpatations,
  random nausea, 
  
- change of place seems better

**My question is about therapy and tablets, I am afraid**

Who to go to? are tablets the solution? It looks like
