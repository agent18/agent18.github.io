Why should we go behind our value system?
Why are you differentiaing yourself from the brain. Aren't you all the same?
What other options do we have?
Another approach to determining the true value system? (Peter singer's essay)

Assuming that North doesn't change, I need to add a correction factor to my intuition or completely screw this shit and use a complete different devise to take me in the right direction. But is there any such devise that you can use devoid of your feelings H&Bs? Is your current compass any good? What about the solution in the head can we use that? 

What is the right direction? 
What does my ultimate value system want me to do? Is there an ultimate value system? What is more imporant? how do I decide
How do I discover more of the value system and how do I know I am right?


People are dying, they are helplessly waiting at the shore (metaphorically) and raising their arms towards the sky and saying help me. The Real Joke is I can help them, not all of them but a few atleast. and they are looking up to the sky with the belief that someone can pull them out of their misery. No one wants to suffer. When you see those videos, you fucking cry. Why not act? 

How far do I go? You want to help every single person at your feet. Why not all, why not as full retard as you can?

> It's like a game, you maximize the shit out of the score.

For what joy?
For the joy of the game!

Dont buy a ultra flat screen telivision, when yiour current one totally works fine. Don't buy a new house, when you already have 4 to 5 houses in the pipeline. Don't upgrade your car for another 100 000 Euros, All this is plain plain fucking useless. What do these material things give you anyway? Well then can I ask you to please give up your vacation? 

Outzaaat!

How about we start at 10%! 
What about my needs?
Please tell me you said what about my knees!

I think the key is to realize that w

He says that it is morally not relavent where the people are from, or whether we are at that location of trouble or not. If we want to help in the case of the Chinese girl, then we want to help everywhere as well, and we should use our brain to effectively use our resources to help them. He has the bloody nerve to add that people spend their money on not so important things like buying a bottle of water, when it is perfectly available to drink at the tap, or for that matter taking vacations even.  


I deserve to splurge in *insert random unwanted things such as pricy cars ipads, iphones, etc.*. I am convinced now about the uselessness of dedicating time and money to buying cars, ipads and iphones. The novelty wears off. Dedicating and saving shit loads of money in the end to buy a bmw which gives you say one month of happiness does not cut it for me. 


#### **in other words**



In socialistic countries such as Netherlands, Germany, Portugal the tax is extremely high. This helps to fund things like healthcare, loss of job insurance, free or dirt cheap education for the students along with loans with dead low interests. Their point is everyone gets access to education with as little monetary burden and then once they start makin money help out the newer generations. 

Healthcare also works in a similar way. Everyone has access to the same top quality healthcare. Everyone pays insurance or it is part of the taxes. This premium paid inturn takes care of those diseases like cancer that are rare and would need lot of money. Everyone benifits from such a system. 


Why would you spend your money on others?
