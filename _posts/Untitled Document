Why should we go behind our value system?
Why are you differentiaing yourself from the brain. Aren't you all the same?
What other options do we have?
Another approach to determining the true value system? (Peter singer's essay)

Assuming that North doesn't change, I need to add a correction factor to my intuition or completely screw this shit and use a complete different devise to take me in the right direction. But is there any such devise that you can use devoid of your feelings H&Bs? Is your current compass any good? What about the solution in the head can we use that? 

What is the right direction? 
What does my ultimate value system want me to do? Is there an ultimate value system? What is more imporant? how do I decide
How do I discover more of the value system and how do I know I am right?


People are dying, they are helplessly waiting at the shore (metaphorically) and raising their arms towards the sky and saying help me. The Real Joke is I can help them, not all of them but a few atleast. and they are looking up to the sky with the belief that someone can pull them out of their misery. No one wants to suffer. When you see those videos, you fucking cry. Why not act? 

How far do I go? You want to help every single person at your feet. Why not all, why not as full retard as you can?

> It's like a game, you maximize the shit out of the score.

For what joy?
For the joy of the game!

Dont buy a ultra flat screen telivision, when yiour current one totally works fine. Don't buy a new house, when you already have 4 to 5 houses in the pipeline. Don't upgrade your car for another 100 000 Euros, All this is plain plain fucking useless. What do these material things give you anyway? Well then can I ask you to please give up your vacation? 

Outzaaat!

How about we start at 10%! 
What about my needs?

He says that it is morally not relavent where the people are from, or whether we are at that location of trouble or not. If we want to help in the case of the Chinese girl, then we want to help everywhere as well, and we should use our brain to effectively use our resources to help them. He has the bloody nerve to add that people spend their money on not so important things like buying a bottle of water, when it is perfectly available to drink at the tap, or for that matter taking vacations even.  


I deserve to splurge in *insert random unwanted things such as pricy cars ipads, iphones, etc.*. I am convinced now about the uselessness of dedicating time and money to buying cars, ipads and iphones. The novelty wears off. Dedicating and saving shit loads of money in the end to buy a bmw which gives you say one month of happiness does not cut it for me. 


#### **in other words**



In socialistic countries such as Netherlands, Germany, Portugal the tax is extremely high. This helps to fund things like healthcare, loss of job insurance, free or dirt cheap education for the students along with loans with dead low interests. Their point is everyone gets access to education with as little monetary burden and then once they start makin money help out the newer generations. 

Healthcare also works in a similar way. Everyone has access to the same top quality healthcare. Everyone pays insurance or it is part of the taxes. This premium paid inturn takes care of those diseases like cancer that are rare and would need lot of money. Everyone benifits from such a system.

> The essence of analysis is to "break it down", to take apart vague wholes into clearer parts.  For the same reasons we make point lists to help us make tough job decisions, or ask people who sue for damages to name an amount and break it into components, we should try to break down these important social claims via simple calculations.  And the absence of attempts at this is a sad commentary on something.

#### **Why marry?**

**What will you do for sex?**
I am a virgin. I have never even kissed a girl. I am fucking 26. I masturbate yes. If I am so desperate, I will go to the nearby red light area. In the country I live in, its quite easy to access these things. Although, there is this fear of fucking a really hot woman, if desperate can be done.



Assumptions: 
Your wife and you earn similar money. 
Expenses occurring during within a marriage:
1) marriage expenses by my parents and me ( a fucking lot; to the tune of atleast 7 lakh rs. ~=10000 Euros )
2) expenses in gifts during different days of the year
3) probability that your wife is a religious nut head

Benefits:

Get real, its not like you are going to have sex every fucking day for the rest of your life. 

In essence the comparison is paying for sex by marriage or to a prostitute. 


What am I doing now for sex

People who want to start a family

Marriage for men! jsut why?

A woman who earns as much as the man or more, who doesn't depend on a man for economic security, I feel is all the more going to be a bigger bitch. She needs you for one thing less. The data is not abundant on this.

Looking at my parents, looking at all my female cousins and their respective male counter parts, looking at the people I know in chennai, looking at the people I know in Holland, considering the market in India on marriage websites, I am going to for now assume that these women are less in number.

I have an issue in my house.

It's hard to ask someone sorry, all the more harder if it is not fully your fault. In situations like this, what does the philosophy of revenge and grow dictate?

There have been a couple of situations, which I want to look back upon, and come up with what action I should have taken. My recent travels to India,

My bigger and most important need for this is that my mind is meant for higher purposes, I cannot and will not tolerate being consumed by literal shit that is social games, whose significance to the most important things in life is nil. More people are going to die in the time that you spend your time on social games.

What do you do when you do not have control!


standing up for yourself? when michal gives you some shit!
staircase incident urr
in the car incident!

For example, recently my good friend had an issue in his house. His roommates were smoking in his in the balcony and the smoke came into his room. He told them twice already. Frankly, I beleive this is the type of incident that consumes you. You don't want to die of cancer, they don't understand whats the problem. There is smoke in your room and you need to confront them, but they are high status people and you are afraid of confronting them every single time as they can be assholes. The roommates have been dicks, the roommates will be dicks. So he escalated it with to his landlord and luckily things got under control for him. Of course the roomates look at him as the villian. It is expected that the roommates having heard from the landlord regarding the escalation are going to come and talk to him. All the anxiety and drama, consumed me a third person, let alone another poor soul. I can remember the number of times, my brain would revisit the incident and ponder about it. I was present during one such conversations, I was adding social proof, and supporting my friend. I remember trying to argue with one of the roommates regarding the right thing to do, but I found myself a few minutes later thinking about what I should have told him during the time of the arguement.  He made an epic statement in the end, "I cannot live with Indians anymore. I am so angry, every single time I worked with them, it was a problem."

And now it is revenge time, every single thing my friend does will be made an issue of. The roommates dont talk with him anymore I guess.

It's a visious cycle that will only end 
My point is, after the initial conversations, I understand that he is stubborn. I cannot imagine a scenario that he 

--------


It is our desire to know the truth reliably. A few years back I had seen a TED talk delivered by Peter Singer, after it was suggested to me by an STM. In the ["purpose of life-continued"][th_purpose], I had discussed about this video, and that it did not provide convincing evidence for me to to know what I should do in life. 

>It seems rather convenient for Peter to use feelings to judge a situation as and when he wants. I am referring to the same [video] we were discussing in the [previous post]. Peter attempts to cleverly bait people into biting into his agenda of saving the world. He starts of with showing a video of a child being let to die mercilessly. He asks the audience how many of them would help if they were in that situation. Almost everyone bit the bait. I raised my hand as well. A few seconds later he says 6.9 million children died that year(2012), and we should help them. WTF! But I don't feel like helping them, it didn't pain me like the death of the child in the video. If it pains me, if I feel like it, then we can think about it. Having anticipated what I(and others) was going to say a few years later, Peter says in the lecture, that we should use some of our heart and some of our mind. He meant to say I think, that although we don't feel it, we should still help, i.e., we should not entirely listen to our feelings.    
    
>Well Well Well! What do we have here. To sum it up, he baits us with our feelings (with the video), later when feelings won't work for his agenda, he almost says, you can't keep listening to feelings, you need to calculatedly go beyond it. Word!
    
>My point is why go in the direction Peter is going, why not the other way round. Why not say, 6.9 million are dying every year (and we don't feel anything even after hearing it), so when we feel the pain of that one child in the video we should just ignore it? 

>We know that feelings are useless, they change 300 times a second and can't help us get anywhere with respect to knowing our true value system.
-["purpose of life-continued"][th_purpose]

One life has 'x' worth. 6.9 million lives have 'y' worth. We observe that 
#### Why do we wan't to know our true value system

Value system is defined as a set of values every human has owing to his hardwiring. Some examples of Values look like, "Humans do not kill babies", "Humans would like to save as many people as possible".

>It is clear, I have no idea what my true value system is. As in what the hell do I ultimately want to do. What does my value system want. Do I want to save people over getting a girlfriend, or the other way around. Right now, it is so unclear what I want when I look at my feelings for guidance, as it feels like it is changing 300 times a second. What I mean here is that feelings oscillate, its like your brain can’t make up its fucking mind on what it wants. One moment your eyes are pouring rain looking at the misery of people, the next you are looking at Facebook casually and the third you totally forget about the misery of those people you experienced in moment one. So you clearly don’t know what you want.

>Until now I have been blindly doing shit by following feelings. Feelings oscillating of course, but yeah I just focused on finding work, educating myself, masturbating and the shit. A year and a half back, my friend spends a lot of time in educating me on what I should be doing in life and what I want to be doing in life. Now that I have very limited worries, I want to pull my shit together, figure out the road I should be taking and work towards it. I am 26 in a few days, I don’t have many years to pick up new skills. Past is Past and we cannot waste any more time now. If the prophecy is true then I am loosing time, big time. So I better gear up and ascertain the truth behind the prophecy. That is the only reason to write, to think and act hence forth.

>The value system of a fish is I guess to procreate, take care of its clan and find and eat food. No one taught the fish what it needs to do. Its already hardwired into its system. Humans are similarly hardwired to want to do something. The why of it I am not going to get into. And from there H&B’s took over, but we know they suck in performing the task of representing the true value system. Currently my H&B’s are not enabling me well, as they have 3 different answers to the same question (as seen above). I want to know about my true value system, so that I can act in accordance to what I really want and not do things randomly as I would, being left in the hands of feelings, the oscillatanator.

>When being asked why I am following some stupid hardwiring, I don’t really have an answer. I can question it, but I don’t really get an answer. My only point is what else is there to do?. Should a fish then just commit suicide or should it write code, or should it just flap its fins and die or should it build ships? Everything seems to be determined for the fish from the basis of its value system. I am not sure why it is any different for human beings. I am born with some predispositions. It appears I have a strong inclination to work towards my true value system. The very evidence being the very existence of H&B’s. H&B’s work as design rules to imitate the value system. But they suck, and now I am on my own to know and act in accordance to the value system.

>It appears that the solution inside my head wants me to follow my value system.

1. All humans don't want to pay more than 88 as they have other things more important to purchase.

I guess it was something like their good deed for the year. Of course it had nothing to do with the number of birds. If for some reason we give some benifit to this hypothesis, then we see that it is accepted as 'good' to help save birds.

1. Humans made the calculation that irrespective of the number of birds, you only need 1 net.

Irrespective of the size of the birds, you only need one net. Maybe this is the thing that shows? I can't imagine that many people had any idea regarding the costs of production to make such a net feasible. But then there needs to be a whole sort of calculation as to how many people donate and the total cost, then allowing one to calculate the actual sum he needs to put in this WTP. I would call this a fail. I am not able to imagine people doing all this math with guess numbers before they came to a conclusion. I guess it is fair to say just a number based on the emotional state.


1. "purchase of moral satisfaction"
 

1. WTP proportional to the image created.

>increasing the alleged risk of chlorinated drinking water from 0.004 to 2.43 annual deaths per 1000 - a factor of 600 - increased willingness-to-pay from $3.78 to $15.23.   
-[Eliezer in his blog on scope insensitivity][ele_scope]


>[People visualize][ele_scope] "a single exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape" 

Humans don't understand the difference between 10000 hairs and 100,000 hairs. We can imagine it, but we can't "feel" it.

These humans seem to be scope insensitive. Nothing scales, let alone proportionally.

My friend would not have paid one euro to all the dying folk in the world. Suddenly after seeing that his x-teachers daughter had a disease, he donated 75 euros straight. I am afraid of using more of these sentences as it starts another web of hypotheses, that is hard for a pandian like myself to track. That's why I wan't to stick with basic for now. Upgrade later.

1) Humans care for all birds, not just the first 2000. It's because of messed up H&B's

The very fact that we donated in the first place, seems to tell me that we care, doesn't it? 

Money is the unit of caring. Put your money where your care is. No impact no right to "care".

Studies have shown that willingness to pay, has a logarithmic or no relationship with respect to scope size in general, not just for birds. The ability of people to donate to charities somehow is bound by some numbers irrespective of the number of children being saved. One explanation is in terms of [judgment of prototype][wiki_scope]

>The story [...] probably evokes for many readers a mental representation of a prototypical incident, perhaps an image of an exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape,"[4] and subjects based their willingness-to-pay mostly on that mental image.

From somewhere we get the idea that somehow x euros will be enough.

They want to help but are unwilling to do more!


**Reflection**
Humans pay literally the same to save birds irrespective of their number.

The first assumption is that 

Repeatability

Money is the unit of caring.

All humans don't care about birds. 

This is representative? How?

What about birds less than 2000

What is the connection of this to 1 person and 6.9 million
---
**Hypothesis**

**Observation:**
I don't feel the proportional pain when I see 1 person die, as when I hear 6.9 million people dying.

What does my value system actually wan't? Does it want me to extrapolate the pain I see for 1 person to 6.9 million people, and take action hence, or does it want me to extrapolate the pain I see from 6.9 million people (basically nothing), to the one person? or Does it wan't me to jsut listen to feelings? 

I could be living in many different type of worlds.




#### Oddity

We want to determine the true value system. What we have currently is a layer of H&B's over it. Isn't what we are seeing H&B's? How can we ever go to the actual value system? 

When 83% of the data pays, couldn't it just be the manifestation of the H&B's playing a cruel trick? This is the part I am not able to digest. 83% of the people donating means that I wan't to save birds, but if those 83% don't pay for more than 2000 birds or more money, then we say H&B's. Painful! An STM, pnn!

Take the intuition wherein you want to save the life of a child who is dying right now, right next to you, who got run over by van. You very well know that you have to pay 10k right now and you won't get it back. But what I just said was hypothetical, whereas in real life, there are millions of children dying. Your intuition wanted to save the dying child now, so you should be atleast saving one child now although the emotional quotient is high?

Well should I just ask my self from within, and get the answer that is best suited? So should I just question myself asking, why it makes a difference if the person is next to me or not. It's a helpless child, why am I calculating what I feel into the picture? when I want that child to be alive?

My second intuition could be right and I have to extrapolate the intuition to the first...

Well you feel too stongly against this?

You also feel too strongly against going shopping should you?
But its just shopping. how can you compare that with saving a life? 

I still cant make sense of the reaonsing I am providing myself regarding this.. I need to define I feel like, something consistant and then go by it. not keep making excuses as they come up. Make the hypothesis before testing it?

our brain has some shortcomings, it can't naturally multiply, it can't naturally compare different situations.



#### What I am worried about

Prejudice!



But now I have already discussed this with my friend, a million times and seen enough footage online, that nowadays, I cry for everything. I cry for every scene in batman, Gandhi! I just need to think of it and bam! Water falls! The point I am trying to make is I am convinced on some level, and I don't want my prejudice to guide me to the answer! But maybe you cant help it or maybe you cam. 
My intuition re
garding saving people is lets say X. and then I feel I want to conclude and this is over. But no, I am afraid, that I already "know the answer" and I might make

Eleizer says, bro, you don't stop looking for an answer once you think something is or feel something is. but then despite further reasoning, observation, rational thought, if it still appears to stay the same then ok!

Lets do the first question we did now with the new reasoning abilities we have gained?


Science can always look at Hueristics and biases are always there to probably tell you better. Better how?


#### The same question

An induvidual child gets significantly more funds than a group of 8 children despite the target group being the same. 

How can it be significantly more better to have 1,312,44




If this is the case, then it can be imagined

I have 200 $ and I can spend it on a trivium concert or I can send it to Give Well and probably contribute to saving 



It seems not too hard to imagine someone keeping a person at gunpoint, and threatening you to give up your 60k TV that you just bought, so you can save this mans life. Will you do it? Of course you will. 


Wants seem to be divided into things that are primal, secondary, tertiary and so on. Primary wants would be, 'I want food', 'I want girlfriends', 'I want a social life', 'I want to keep warm', 'I want my people to live', 'I want to live' and the like...

We want some wants more than others. These wants, also vary based on other factors and as a result change with time. Like for example, **NOW** I see there is a sick want to get girlfriends despite the fact that there are other things to do as there are so many millions of people suffering. But **if I am in a situation** where there is one person dying and I need to give up the only time I actually get laid in my life, well I guess I would. It seems not too hard to imagine someone keeping a person at gunpoint, and threatening you to give up your 60k TV that you just bought, so you can save this mans life. Will you do it? Of course you will. But, there are people metaphorically being kept at gunpoint by yamadeva (the dying people) and yet we don't do anything to save them. It's just a fucking TV. But how many TV's is one life worth and how many TV's is 10 lives worth. 

Based on these, there are the secondary and tertiary wants so to naively speak, such as : wanting toned abs, wanting tasty foods, wanting a cool social cirlce, wanting hip clothes, wanting the latest IPAD, Mercedes etc. This we call for now as secondary wants as they are based on primary wants.

We think some secondary or tertiary wants will get us to our primary wants. If you look at the nature of people trying to workout, I imagine one of the reasons is with the hope that it gets girls. To be properly toned takes a couple of years. There seem to be far better techniques with faster and quicker results that we could pursue instead.

The real question is what do we want to do, owing to our vascillatory nature. It is clear there is no consistancy.Where do we go from here?

Summary is that what we want seems to be circular, now what?


So we seem to want some wants more than others. Like for example, we can don't mind giving up a 60k Television when someone is held at gunpoint.

I would like to figure out what I should be doing. If I should 


#### Reason for such problems

Evolutoin and the like


----



When we talk about religion, it appears that people don't easily bow down to reason; (as though you do!). They think blind faith is justified. For them the effects of social proof is seemingly more important than reason. They have told themselves and using confirmation bias fooled themselves so much that they cannot change? The very first flag for me is that they beleive in an almost random book, 0 evidence. They give you shit that is absolutely unacceptable by the standards of science. Just because their surroundings seem to think it is THE book, it's not fair to trust social proof to such extents. They are quite closed as no points of view can convince them even with facts being blatantly wrong in the book (such as the earth is not flat).

My point seems to be that they don't bow to reason. They hold on to something, merely because they have been holding on to it for a while, social proof, maybe thats the way they have been brought up. They do not see the discrepency when they use science when you need to build an aircraft, a 100 storey building, but somehow think it is sane to trust something without any evidence what so ever, despite them being against known facts. We use science because it works. It predicts things. It has a far more better success rate than your friendly neighbourhood FAITH. So yes. Reason where art thou?

Leave the terrorists. Let's go for something simple. Like how your parents or a good population still continue to be theists. I myself tried to speak to several people. Every convert (to atheism) might have tried speaking to others. People are not ready to change their beliefs. It's hard. There is a very high resistance to change something that is so dear to you, something that you beleived for years. It requires you to accept that you are wrong. Maybe there are some other things that seem to be more important than reason according to their solution in their head.




---



I think after a point you just have to accept something, as there is nothing to argue from!

I understand that 
Assuming that I do find the utility and all the variables that are necessary to make the calculations towards the true value system,

So what do we do... I see that we can go in search of the true value system and maximize it's utility.
Hail the value system

do what you do? Find yourself in circular preferences. and make shitty decisions regardign children who desparately need your help.

There is no god, and people are streching their hands to the sky, asking someone for help. Little do they know that they are axing you for help. Little did I know that I was being axed help.

or what else?

Suicide?

In the end send the whole of this shit for peerreviewed reasonging.s
Peer-reviewed resonning!


So what should we do? The shortcomings of feelings has been presented all along. I guess its just a decision making thing. They are circular, not extrapolatable, inconsistant etc... If you continue to only rely on them, especially to make calculations regarding your value system, then good luck.

Today I am at work and my team has a bunch of 'stories' in our backlog. We are looking at prioritising each of the stories so we have some way of knowing what is important. My DL just happened to give numbers to every story. If a story has '50' its super important, if a story has '15', then it is not as important as the one that has '50' priority. I understand the reasoning as to why he chose a number, higher than something else. but how do you make a computer do this?

Ultimately its all a feeling. If someone axes you how you came up with a number you can give some reasonsing. If they ask you why its 50 and not 51 or not 52. With the limited capacity of this brain, we do what we can. We leave a lot to the intelligent beings.

With this, I probably shall figure out more in detail about what I need to do. And start my first ever contribution to the Give Well foudnation.


#### Base feelings

The larger goal seems to be that we want to have consistant wants, non-fragile wants, non-silly wants, wants that last despite some shit feelings based on shitass calculations.

The fault with the brain roughly speaking seems to be calculations, extrapolations, large numbers, inconsistent feelings, different feelings for the same event based on different sensory experiences. Some other examples, would be is that you brain is trying to map reality using sensory organs. Based on whether it sees something or hears something, the situation within us completely is different. Imagine hearing that 6 million people are dying. Not phased one bit. Show me one peta or allepo video, tears.

As Thalaivar says,

>"Intuition", as a term of art, is not a curse word when it comes to morality - **there is nothing else to argue from**.  Even modus ponens is an "intuition" in this sense - it's just that modus ponens still seems like a good idea after being formalized, reflected on, extrapolated out to see if it has sensible consequences, etcetera.

It's not a curse word, stop thinking of feelings as some low level piece of shit. As we have seen earlier, there is nothing else to argue from. Every thing is a feeling, and that is all we have. We realize that feelings are problematic but then there seems to be something we can do. Right now probably the only thing we can do. The only rule of thumb available seems to be the one that Eleizer says,

>The obvious choice isn’t always the best choice, but sometimes, by golly, it is. I don’t stop looking as soon I find an obvious answer, but if I go on looking, and the obvious-seeming answer still seems obvious, I don’t feel guilty about keeping it. Oh, sure, everyone thinks two plus two is four, everyone says two plus two is four, and in the mere mundane drudgery of everyday life everyone behaves as if two plus two is four, but what does two plus two really, ultimately equal? As near as I can figure, four.

When you see someone tell you that "The snow is white if and only if the snow is white", what do you do?

Although the sentence seems to be giving us trivial information, I think its one of those statements that you choose to accept or not. The snow is white by definition if and only if the snow is white. The snow is said to be white only if the snow is white. It appears like a fundamental statement. It seems to make sense.The snow can be said to be white, if and only if the snow is actually white. The statement the snow is white becomes both the point as well as the if condition. It makes sense, I feel like I understand it. It seems to tell that you have to accept it. There is not much reason. but it seems obvious. There is no other reason why the snow is white. You care for children's lives, if and only if you care for children's lives.

>Paraphrasing Eleizer, As far as I can figure out 2+2 gives 4. The idea being if you have 2 un-reacting stones, side by side along with 2 more of them, in total you should have 4, and not 3 for example. That is what 2+2 means. Its a facilitator that helps us in daily life to know in advance what we will have in the end. Its a rule of the universe!


#### Reflection

Often we find ourselves, in a situation when we feel absolutely sleepy, but then we push ourselves for something better, something whose reward might be much further in life. There are cases when feelings is not the only thing we go by. We might feel like shit, and still we might have stuck to what seems right than what is feelings. We are capable of doing this

It's not that we want to be completely happy all the time. Sometimes we are ok with letting go of somthing for someone else. Look at Gandhi, look at batman, look at the several thousand activists who work on their ability to give...


P.S

Was drudging the part where in I had nothing to write baout, and when the momnet came, I found things to write. The goal should not be to write intelligently, but to write quantity. Ideas will come. Be patient?



**Hypothesis**

**Observation:**
I don't feel the proportional pain when I see 1 person die, as when I hear 6.9 million people dying.

What does my value system actually wan't? Does it want me to extrapolate the pain I see for 1 person to 6.9 million people, and take action hence, or does it want me to extrapolate the pain I see from 6.9 million people (basically nothing), to the one person? or Does it wan't me to jsut listen to feelings?

I could be living in many different type of worlds.




#### Oddity

We want to determine the true value system. What we have currently is a layer of H&B's over it. Isn't what we are seeing H&B's? How can we ever go to the actual value system?

When 83% of the data pays, couldn't it just be the manifestation of the H&B's playing a cruel trick? This is the part I am not able to digest. 83% of the people donating means that I wan't to save birds, but if those 83% don't pay for more than 2000 birds or more money, then we say H&B's. Painful! An STM, pnn!

Take the intuition wherein you want to save the life of a child who is dying right now, right next to you, who got run over by van. You very well know that you have to pay 10k right now and you won't get it back. But what I just said was hypothetical, whereas in real life, there are millions of children dying. Your intuition wanted to save the dying child now, so you should be atleast saving one child now although the emotional quotient is high?

Well should I just ask my self from within, and get the answer that is best suited? So should I just question myself asking, why it makes a difference if the person is next to me or not. It's a helpless child, why am I calculating what I feel into the picture? when I want that child to be alive?

My second intuition could be right and I have to extrapolate the intuition to the first...

Well you feel too stongly against this?

You also feel too strongly against going shopping should you?
But its just shopping. how can you compare that with saving a life?

I still cant make sense of the reaonsing I am providing myself regarding this.. I need to define I feel like, something consistant and then go by it. not keep making excuses as they come up. Make the hypothesis before testing it?

our brain has some shortcomings, it can't naturally multiply, it can't naturally compare different situations.



#### What I am worried about

Prejudice!



But now I have already discussed this with my friend, a million times and seen enough footage online, that nowadays, I cry for everything. I cry for every scene in batman, Gandhi! I just need to think of it and bam! Water falls! The point I am trying to make is I am convinced on some level, and I don't want my prejudice to guide me to the answer! But maybe you cant help it or maybe you cam.
My intuition re
garding saving people is lets say X. and then I feel I want to conclude and this is over. But no, I am afraid, that I already "know the answer" and I might make

Eleizer says, bro, you don't stop looking for an answer once you think something is or feel something is. but then despite further reasoning, observation, rational thought, if it still appears to stay the same then ok!

Lets do the first question we did now with the new reasoning abilities we have gained?


Science can always look at Hueristics and biases are always there to probably tell you better. Better how?


#### The same question

An induvidual child gets significantly more funds than a group of 8 children despite the target group being the same.

How can it be significantly more better to have 1,312,44
