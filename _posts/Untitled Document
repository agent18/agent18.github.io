Why should we go behind our value system?
Why are you differentiaing yourself from the brain. Aren't you all the same?
What other options do we have?
Another approach to determining the true value system? (Peter singer's essay)

Assuming that North doesn't change, I need to add a correction factor to my intuition or completely screw this shit and use a complete different devise to take me in the right direction. But is there any such devise that you can use devoid of your feelings H&Bs? Is your current compass any good? What about the solution in the head can we use that? 

What is the right direction? 
What does my ultimate value system want me to do? Is there an ultimate value system? What is more imporant? how do I decide
How do I discover more of the value system and how do I know I am right?


People are dying, they are helplessly waiting at the shore (metaphorically) and raising their arms towards the sky and saying help me. The Real Joke is I can help them, not all of them but a few atleast. and they are looking up to the sky with the belief that someone can pull them out of their misery. No one wants to suffer. When you see those videos, you fucking cry. Why not act? 

How far do I go? You want to help every single person at your feet. Why not all, why not as full retard as you can?

> It's like a game, you maximize the shit out of the score.

For what joy?
For the joy of the game!

Dont buy a ultra flat screen telivision, when yiour current one totally works fine. Don't buy a new house, when you already have 4 to 5 houses in the pipeline. Don't upgrade your car for another 100 000 Euros, All this is plain plain fucking useless. What do these material things give you anyway? Well then can I ask you to please give up your vacation? 

Outzaaat!

How about we start at 10%! 
What about my needs?
Please tell me you said what about my knees!

I think the key is to realize that w

He says that it is morally not relavent where the people are from, or whether we are at that location of trouble or not. If we want to help in the case of the Chinese girl, then we want to help everywhere as well, and we should use our brain to effectively use our resources to help them. He has the bloody nerve to add that people spend their money on not so important things like buying a bottle of water, when it is perfectly available to drink at the tap, or for that matter taking vacations even.  


I deserve to splurge in *insert random unwanted things such as pricy cars ipads, iphones, etc.*. I am convinced now about the uselessness of dedicating time and money to buying cars, ipads and iphones. The novelty wears off. Dedicating and saving shit loads of money in the end to buy a bmw which gives you say one month of happiness does not cut it for me. 


#### **in other words**



In socialistic countries such as Netherlands, Germany, Portugal the tax is extremely high. This helps to fund things like healthcare, loss of job insurance, free or dirt cheap education for the students along with loans with dead low interests. Their point is everyone gets access to education with as little monetary burden and then once they start makin money help out the newer generations. 

Healthcare also works in a similar way. Everyone has access to the same top quality healthcare. Everyone pays insurance or it is part of the taxes. This premium paid inturn takes care of those diseases like cancer that are rare and would need lot of money. Everyone benifits from such a system.

#### **Reality**


#### **Assumption**

Why wouldn't you want to live as long as possible, if you are in good health, if you have good friends, family, you can still work and contribute to various important things. Why? Today you want to live tomorrow. Tomorrow you want to live another day. If the future is not too bad, why not live as long as you possibly can.

Assuming that your value system wants you to live as long as possible, and that in general, killing people is wrong,

#### **Break down into componenets**

> The essence of analysis is to "break it down", to take apart vague wholes into clearer parts.  For the same reasons we make point lists to help us make tough job decisions, or ask people who sue for damages to name an amount and break it into components, we should try to break down these important social claims via simple calculations.  And the absence of attempts at this is a sad commentary on something.    
-[Robin Hanson][break-cryonics-down]

Breaking down into components seems to give a better way of estimating costs. 

#### Striking difference

I was trying to find out the stance of Elon Musk on cryonics, when I came across this [quora page][quora_elon]. Here there was a comment by someone who was quoting [this article][cryonics_scam]. How do you go about deciding what choice we need to make

#### **Others**
When you tell others about this, immediately you are going to hear a laugh [conan]. 

Why would you wan't to live longer than 100? with the assumption that life is going to suck!

Thats so stupid, why do you think you are going to be revived?

Cryonics is a psuedo science?
Seems like it at first?


#### **Why marry?**

**What will you do for sex?**
I am a virgin. I have never even kissed a girl. I am fucking 26. I masturbate yes. If I am so desperate, I will go to the nearby red light area. In the country I live in, its quite easy to access these things. Although, there is this fear of fucking a really hot woman, if desperate can be done.



Assumptions: 
Your wife and you earn similar money. 
Expenses occurring during within a marriage:
1) marriage expenses by my parents and me ( a fucking lot; to the tune of atleast 7 lakh rs. ~=10000 Euros )
2) expenses in gifts during different days of the year
3) probability that your wife is a religious nut head

Benefits:

Get real, its not like you are going to have sex every fucking day for the rest of your life. 

In essence the comparison is paying for sex by marriage or to a prostitute. 


What am I doing now for sex

##### The Independent women
>A woman who pays her own bills, buys her own things, and does not allow a man to affect her stability or self-confidence. She supports herself entirely on her own and is proud to be able to do so.    
-[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_woman)

A woman who earns as much as the man or more, who doesn't depend on a man for economic security, I feel is all the more going to be a bigger bitch. She needs you for one thing less. The data is not abundant on this.

Looking at my parents, looking at all my female cousins and their respective male counter parts, looking at the people I know in chennai, looking at the people I know in Holland, considering the market in India on marriage websites, I am going to for now assume that these women are less in number. P(of getting married to such a women) = 30% chance lets say.

#### Advice
The common advice on ["Dont marry"][dont_marry] is to stay in control. To never back down unless you are in the wrong. Don't take shit. People say things like this, but how exactly do you fucking take control. 

>"What a bunch of whiny pussy whipped shitheads. I’ve been married for over 25 years and I have full control of everything. How did I do it? Easy, just adopt an attitude of, “hey, if you don’t like it, there’s the fucking door”. This attitude has served my marriage well. My wife thinks I’m one step away from walking out, and she treats me like a king. Of course I treat her with respect and don’t rub it in her face, but she knows that in the end, I run the show. We get along just fine. Get a grip you fucking pussies. stay in control"    
-someone in the thread ["Dont marry"][dont_marry]

What I don't get from this is how exactly does one stay in control. He says he tells her where the door is, but doesn't she already have the hand from the marriage in the first place? She can leave and she gets HALF.
