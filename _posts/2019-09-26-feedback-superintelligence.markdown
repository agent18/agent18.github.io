# Look at mistakes and identify how you can work on that particular
mistake.

Is it grammar or is it something beyond?

## example not matching subject
## no example
### beliefs

> (Crime)[0] should (not pay)[1], is (very simple common sense)[2].
>
> Claims: Crime should not pay
>
> Definition: checks out I think!

This is a predicate based on his beliefs about what is right and
wrong, not on empirical examples. “Crime does not pay” is a predicate
about the world and it would be false if the average crime led to a
lot of money without imprisonment. “Crime should not pay” can be
skipped for now. (“The Holy B says that crime should not pay” is
testable, though.)

### pattern

**how to**: find pattern and guess within 3 mins if it has example or
not.

### context dependent

> Claims: crime does not pay
>
> Didn’t know how the example would look keeping the definition in mind

**how to**: A does not B

## Claims of the future
### future that have examples:

> There are (many issues)[1] we haven’t been able to look into yet, so
> we expect there are other (high-impact areas we haven’t listed)[3].

What made them expect that there are other areas left? If I don’t like
plain Parle G biscuits even after trying many times, I won’t say that
“I expect there are other tasty, plain Parle G biscuits that we
haven’t listed”.

Perhaps they’ve seen an average of 3 out of 10 areas to be promising,
so based on that they expect that maybe 3 out of the remaining 10
would also be good. Or maybe not 3, but at least 1 or 2.

If they had tried a hundred areas and found zero promising ones, they
would not expect too many promising areas in the future.

**How to**: Find future statements and practice like a nigger

### future that does not have examples

> Claim: [3] is at stake (because of AI).

> Example:

> humanity may come to depend on the actions of machines than our own.

In other words, we have no concrete example. If they said that
diseases put human civilization at stake, we can point to the Black
Plague, which killed nearly half the people of Western Europe. Or
nukes (Japan). Or asteroids (dinosaurs).


## IF / missed comparison

### if with missed comparison

> (These areas)[6a] can be (particularly worth pursuing)[7] if you’re
> (especially motivated by one of them)[8].

Your response:

> For [6a] we think of, working in promoting EA as in the above
> example.

> For [8], we think of a personal fit of more than 50%

> For [7], we think of an impact of 5300*50%=2650 lives which is
> better than working a DS job resulting in 530 net people.

But that doesn’t use [8] at all. Why is it particularly worth pursuing
if you are “especially motivated”? The “impact” [7] you pointed out
would seem to be the same if you had [8] or if you didn’t.

I would expect an example where someone who had this magical [8] went
on to have particularly great “impact”. And I suspect that they do not
have that example.

Consider this: You can bowl a particularly high bouncer if you’re 6
feet tall. Showing Bhuvaneshwar Kumar bowling a bouncer is not an
example. You have to show Courtney Walsh bowling a bouncer that is one
foot higher than usual bouncers.

**how to**: find *if* statements and practice like a nigger.

Another sentence: “Given that we want batsmen who are short and have
curly hair, here are the batsmen we found: Sachin Tendulkar, …”

So, if you sorted the table of “all careers” using the fields “how
pressing is this problem?” and “how pressing is the bottleneck they’re
focusing on?”, then the five top careers are …

Giving an example of Jacques Kallis would be wrong because he isn’t
short and doesn’t have curly hair. Ricky Ponting would be wrong
because he doesn’t have curly hair.

### hidden comparison (reduced, brought goals down)

> Claims: Getting married is [12].
>
> Subject: Being Married
>
> Predicate: is [12].
>
> Example: The great Eliezer Yudkowsky, Paul Graham, Bill Gates, Vishwanath Anand are all married.
>
> Here I should have compared for example what Eliezer is and would have
> been if he was not married or sumpin in that context. But I didn’t

I think this is a problem of *subject-predicate-split*, as a result of
which I missed the example. I give example of people being
married. but then I need to check if their lives sucked or not. Either
I didn't do that i.e., *example-matching-definition* or

**Claims**: Getting an atom bomb is dangerous

**Subject**: People who have done this US got atom bombs

**Definition**: they bombed iraq and killed X people

checs out.

**Claims**: getting married has brought goals down

**Subject**: how the goals of the people have changed

**Predicate**: has changed for the worse


Now even if I give the example of eliezer I don't care, I will not
satisfy the predicate by just saying eliezer and that he is still
top. Atleast it looks like they are still top ... of course this means
nothing in the eyes of confounding variables


*example-matching-subject*; *failed*; *subject-predicate-split*;
*failed* 

**how-to**: subject predicate proper split.
