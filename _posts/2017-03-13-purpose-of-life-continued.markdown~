#### **Previously on the blog**

I am well off, People are dying, very few people giving a fuck are some of the things we saw in the last post. In [What is the purpose of life], we concluded about our inability to distinguish the real value system, using our feelings, owing to H&B's and their inabilities to produce a constant output. And hence we have disqualified feelings from attempting to show us our true value system.

#### **Verdict on Peter Singer**
It seems rather convenient for Peter to use feelings to judge a situation as and when he wants. I am referring to the same [video] we were discussing in the [previous post]. Peter attempts to cleverly bait people into biting into his agenda of saving the world. He starts of with showing a video of a child being let to die mercilessly. He asks the audience how many of them would help if they were in that situation. Almost everyone bit the bait. I raised my hand as well. A few seconds later he says 6.9 million children died that year(2012), and we should help them. WTF! But I don't feel like helping them, it didn't pain me like the death of the child in the video. If it pains me, if I feel like it, then we can think about it. Having anticipated what I(and others) was going to say a few years later, Peter says in the lecture, that we should use some of our heart and some of our mind. He meant to say I think, that although we don't feel it, we should still help, i.e., we should not entirely listen to our feelings.

Well Well Well! What do we have here. To sum it up, he baits us with our feelings (with the video), later when feelings won't work for his agenda, he almost says, you can't keep listening to feelings, you need to calculatedly go beyond it. Word!

My point is why go in the direction Peter is going, why not the other way round. Why not say, 6.9 million are dying every year (and we don't feel anything even after hearing it), so when we feel the pain of that one child in the video we should just ignore it? 

We know that feelings are useless, they change 300 times a second and can't help us get anywhere with respect to knowing our true value system.

I do not want to listen to Peter and follow it, even though at this point it echos with the [solution inside my head].

A voice asks me, "Mr.Pandian, If it appeals with the solution inside your head, isn't it the one?"

The Solution inside my head although resonates with Peters ideas, so what? Although I judge this Peter's ideas with The Solution inside my head and it resonates, the same solution inside my head also asks me to reason like a bitch! And I am not able to move past the cheap choosy way of using feelings to propagate his (Peter) agenda. 

#### **Why find out the true Value  system**
It is clear, I have no idea what my true value system is. As in what the hell do I ultimately want to do. What does my value system want.  Do I want to save people over getting a girlfriend, or the other way around. Right now, it is so unclear what I want when I look at my feelings for guidance, as it feels like it is changing 300 times a second. What I mean here is that feelings oscillate, its like your brain can't make up its fucking mind on what it wants. One moment your eyes are pouring rain looking at the misery of people, the next you are looking at Facebook casually and the third you totally forget about the misery of those people you experienced in moment one. So you clearly don't know what you want.

Until now I have been blindly doing shit by following feelings. Feelings oscillating of course, but yeah I just focused on finding work, educating myself, masturbating and the shit. A year and a half back, my friend spends a lot of time in educating me on what I should be doing in life and what I want to be doing in life. Now that I have very limited worries, I want to pull my shit together, figure out the road I should be taking and work towards it. I am 26 in a few days, I don't have many years to pick up new skills. Past is Past and we cannot waste any more time now. If the prophecy is true then I am loosing time, big time. So I better gear up and ascertain the truth behind the prophecy. That is the only reason to write, to think and act hence forth. 

The value system of a fish is I guess to procreate, take care of its clan and find and eat food. No one taught the fish what it needs to do. Its already hardwired into its system. Humans are similarly hardwired to want to do something. The why of it I am not going to get into. And from there H&B's took over, but we know they suck in performing the task of representing the true value system. Currently my H&B's are not enabling me well, as they have 3 different answers to the same question (as seen above). I want to know about my true value system, so that I can act in accordance to **what I really want** and not do things randomly as I would, being left in the hands of feelings, the oscillatanator.

When being asked why I am following some stupid hardwiring, I don't really have an answer. I can question it, but I don't really get an answer. My only point is what else is there to do?. Should a fish then just commit suicide or should it write code, or should it just flap its fins and die or should it build ships? Everything seems to be determined for the fish from the basis of its value system. I am not sure why it is any different for human beings. I am born with some predispositions. It appears I have a strong inclination to work towards my true value system. The very evidence being the very existence of H&B's. H&B's work as design rules to imitate the value system. But they suck, and now I am on my own to know and act in accordance to the value system.

It appears that the solution inside my head wants me to follow my value system. 

In an attempt to get to the bottom of this, to know better what I should do, I would I guess first like to know my value system.


#### **How do we find our true value system?**

We know that, feelings as a result of processing actions through the H&B's, seem to give us different answers to the same question, at different times. I don't know how we can ascertain from these different answers which is the right answer/ right heuristic/ true value system. 

All that we have is feelings, H&B's and the scientific method. The only clue that we have been left with is that H&B's are trying to approximate the true value system. Having a hard look at just the H&B's seeing what it is actually trying to do might help us determine the Value system. I believe there is a lot of research on H&B's. Scratching the surface or knowing the different biases might help ascertain our value system.

#### **The plan**
Currently, I want to know what the deal is with respect to the following: Should one go behind girls or should one work on assisting the millions of people with solid 3rd world problems. What comes first? For this I would like to start by knowing an overview of the biases.

I would then like to explore aspects such as visual vs auditory reception of data and reaction and our biases related to that. I suspect that this place might give me some potential clues in the discovery of the true value system. It appears that it does not make a difference to us if we save 100 people or 200 people. I would like to dig deeper into the number associated biases. 

Finally attempting to realize what the biases are actually meant for and what they do. In all probability, it should just be possible to look this up and extract simply the value system. Lets go!

P.S

> More than 20 million people are facing starvation and famine across four countries in what the UN heard described as the largest humanitarian crisis in more than 70 years.    
- [Channel 4 news] March 11 2017

> We need 4.4 billion $ to save the life's of 20 million people in Yemen, South Sudan and Nigeria who are starving.
- [AJ+][aj+] few days back!

I would like to make a point that i was writing this essay, which I knew was a dead end. And suddenly, out of nowhere, it hit me, one of the major points IMHO, that will guide me towards my true and ultimate value system - H&B's. Fuck I remember being stuck at this very point a year back.
