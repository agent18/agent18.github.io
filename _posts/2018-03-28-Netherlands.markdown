## The Beginning

**Requirements for Citizenship**

There are two options; One is called "Option" and the other is called
"Naturalization". "Option" doesn't work for us, but "Naturalization
might just.

  * [x] You must be an adult (18 years and over).

  * [ ] You have either: **lived in the Netherlands for an uninterrupted
        period of five years with a valid residence permit;** been
        married to a Dutch national or lived with a Dutch national for
        three continuous years (including abroad); or you have resided
        in the Netherlands with a valid residence permit for a period
        of 10 years, with at least the last two years continuously.
		
Not yet! I am down with 3.5/2.5/1.5 years. This number depends on a
few things. (TBD). What does uninterupted mean?
		
  * [ ] You are **sufficiently integrated** in Dutch society and are able
        to read, write, speak and understand Dutch. You must prove
        this by taking a civic integration examination, and must pass
        the A2-level. If you have attained another diploma or degree
        (in Dutch) you can be eligible for an exemption.
		
By the time I am up for this "interview" I should be sufficiently
integrated. Also they only need me to speak to A2 level, which I would
already be doing in a few more months.

  * [x] In the last four years you have not been subject to a
        custodial sentence, training order, community service order or
        large financial penalty (more than EUR 810).

Should not be too hard!

  * [x] You are prepared to renounce your current nationality. If you
        do not do this your Dutch citizenship may be withdrawn
        (although some exceptions exist for dual nationality).

Last I checked, I know people who are in India, working, doing
everything like they are normal; people from US, people from
India. Why do I need an Indian Passport again. Even if I need to work
back in India! Get it? (TBd)

>By renouncing your nationality you would lose certain rights, which
>would cause you serious financial losses. This could include
>consequences in terms of inheritance law. You must be able to
>demonstrate this.

(TBD before applying)

  * [x] You have a valid permanent residence permit or a valid
        residence permit for a non-temporary purpose, for example,
        family reunification.

I should have a valid residence permit. I already have until the year
of 2023 an RP. Of course, if I change job, I got to do it again.

**5 years to 7 years**

>Proposed changes to Dutch naturalisation laws Since 2013 the Dutch
>government has been considering changing the Dutch Citizenship
>Act. The amendments would extend the required residency period from
>five to seven years before being able to apply for citizenship by
>naturalisation.

>As of December 2016, this amendment has not yet been approved and is
>currently being debated in the Senate. Unconfirmed reports suggest it
>may be introduced in April 2017.

>An interim law would apply to migrants already legally living in the
>Netherlands for three years (uninterrupted) when the new law is
>introduced. These people would still fall under the old requirement
>term of five years to be eligible for naturalisation.
