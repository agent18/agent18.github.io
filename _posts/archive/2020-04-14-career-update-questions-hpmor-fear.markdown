## Should you invest in skill building (so vague) To jump in now or not?

DEDP micro masters, Masters in DS... etc... as a credential.

Someone who has invested in skill now before taking up jobs

**Claims**: Great people seem to jump into jobs head first and swim
out. No 2 years master + 3 year job before jumping into EA.

Peter Hurford started in BA philosophy and started part time at giving
what we can. We later see him work his ass off in kaggle competitions
(triple master) and in the end is controlling RP, CS etc... on an
executive level in addition to working full time as a data
scientist. Apparently, he tried to develop sills needed for this while
keeping his DS job. Peter seems to have jumped into it and been
constantly working on something that got him this far.

Joey savoie seems to have jumped in and done it. Granted he must be
this "exceptional talent" and what not. But he did a masters and moved
on. 

Karolina Sarek seeems to be some sort of prodigy with academic
lecturer at age of 22 in math and computer science despite a policy
and philosophy bacground and seeming-tons of things volunteering in
parallel...

Peter does warn us that it might be a bad idea to look at people
having high impact while making career decision??? Whatttt?

What about Holden Karnofsky? Ben West? David Roodman? Joey, Jamie
Karen?  Tara macaulay? Luke Prog what about them? look at top people
in GiveWell

One reason I think of investing in skill or doing a masters is that it
gives "credentials" while apping for jobs but then you still need to
prove your worth in written tasks. If 50% of the people get an
interview then thats all it serves. Look at people in OPP to
understand what the degree stands for. Am not sure.

Another reason I think of investing in a skill via a masters is, I can
potentially get back to DS in case EA loses funding due to a said
virus? the you have the flexibility. Somehow PH doesn't seem to care
about it. But I think he can always get back with his 5 years of work
experience. So this atleast seems to mean that you need 5 years
exp... which means  years masters plus 5 years. Am not sure.

I cannot imagine EA is not meritocratic. If you are able to go as far
as an interview then I think I am in. Beyond that its all about how
you do in the interview and the 2 assignments.

## Should you start any EA job

internship which does not involve statistics knowledge

And *hopefully* converts into a 

## Should you ETG at FAABK

This involves a master followed by 

Or going to US in an L1 (no idea about the chances)

Consider the possibility that you don't get into EA. You suck in DEDP,
you suck at your internship, and your internship does not really push
you and the whole place is so saturated with researches.

## Should you just be great at something

DS perhaps? or writing

## things to investigate?

- personal fit

- UK vs US

## things to summarrize?

- replaceability debate summary

## Why it makes sense to go to the US

## US vs UK

- Money in DS.

- Do consider the 

What if there are no jobs?

## come up with concrete actions to do

So check out where we at? 

I was thinking about a DS masters considering the chance that I made
am bad at estimating where I stand in the EA world. I didn't get an
internship at CE with 40 people. The reason would be interesting but
for now I don't now why.

Whether EA is the right place to be, considering replaceability?
If replaceability brings up that the things that I can do is GR and
that is gonna be shit because there are so many people apping?

Can I get into EA?

How long to get better at such a skill that you can't really measure?
you don't have feedback?


### planning fallacy and its relevance to my life

HP in the planning fallacy, complains about how his parents refused to
listen to him and just shrugged his concerns off. And he was terrified
to go out and was forced to. Parents don't think they can have a
conversation with their kids that the kids opinion doesn't matter. But
where was RP going? Basically people will not defend you even if they
are your parents. You have to fight for your nigger self. 

The planning fallacy of course suggests that people in their worst
case estimates (99% completion prediction) 50% still don't finish
it. Which makes the case for being pessimistic about what will
happen. You want to predict reality reliably (Whether I will get into
EA), So you would end up overpredicting so that what?

"That's when I realised that everyone who was supposed to protect me
was actually crazy, and that they wouldn't listen to me no matter how
much I begged them, and that I couldn't ever rely on them to get
anything right."


"reality usually delivers results a little worse than the 'worst-case
scenario'. "

"It's actually really hard to be so pessimistic that you stand a
decent chance of undershooting reality."

So I think based on this I should be more careful about making
assumptions about working in EA. There is a growing need to 

that I will get a job in EA if I spend X years. What happens if I
dont' get is really painful for me to take in. Especially considering
the lack of opportunities, or people working for a long time on these
projects, and the fact that I got kicked out of an internship program
after my "research" exam. So from 40 to 20 to 10 maybe. There seems to
be atleast 5 more people or more who have done much better than me for
this single position. And i don't really know where I stink. Hence I
think I come to the conclusion that I should focus probably on earning
to give keeping those options open. ?

This would mean figureing out how to earn like crazy for the rest of
my life in DS? or something in FAABK. I really need to focus on
that. Become a kaggle master. Become good at critical thinking. Become
good in statistics economics or do a DEAP 6 months course. Or ask
peter maybe. 

Do I need to invest in a cedric degory or ?

There are so many reasons why I wouldn't make an EA job: Less jobs,
replaceability is high, I could only be in GR or management, If EA
movement goes through another slump what will I do? the only thing I
haev to fall back on is a slow moving job which is going to be really
hard to grow unless I go to something like customer support instead of
mengg. I need to move on with life. 

So I think, I really need to try and keep options open for me. Pick up
a DS position in ASML. Talk to peopel in ASML could be somethings I
should be doing.

  * [ ] Write up the reasoning as to why you think you need to go
        behind DS instead EA?
		
  * [ ] What Planning fallacy teaches us? how to applly it here.

### Data Science (Day 1,2)

  * [ ] Can I get into DS? (blind, payscale, interviews. )

  * [ ]  What are my options? how long does it take to get a FAABK job
         in DS and how much does it cost? are there other ways?
  * [ ] Potential?
  
  * [ ] How about CS?
  
### Additional considerations are jobs in EA worth it?

  * [ ] Doing a Management job and doing a GR job or Policy? what are
        the expected replaceability?
		
  * [ ] How does replaceability work (spillover effects and MSG
        article)
		
  * [ ] Level 1 thinking level 0 thinking
  
  * [ ] Conclusions
  
### Will I get a job in EA? (Day 2,3)

  * [ ] Write what you think? Why it will be hard
  
  * [ ] What are the suggestions of Peter Hurford and others and
        investigate claims (such as personal fit, great people don't
        do masters, they are right inside since 22).
  
  * [ ] What would help? DEDP course ?
  
  * [ ] Priors based on Karolina's article?
  
  * [ ] Look at survey by hurford and 80khours and see what makes
        others tick?
		
  * [ ] Maybe try to write about longtermism jobs, EA and AEA.
  
  
### Greatness 

  * [ ] So what are you going to be great at?
  
  * [ ]  What about concrete thinking?
  
### Questions that need to be asked asap

- ways to get to a FAABK job in DS?
- Is L1 really an option
- cost of DS courses (Can I afford?)
- infor on J-PAL type courses (reach out to people who have done the course)

### general 

write out claims such as "great people"

people unable to stick to sumpin for more than 2 years. Don't plan for
long, except in that direction . 

### Reading about AI? (2,3,4)

  * [ ] Should I consider longtermist impact? the case for working in AI?

## Final steps (Day 5,6)

   * [ ] Writing a post on EA forum
   
   * [ ] Calling an STM

   * [ ] Writing to people to get advice
   
   * [ ] Looking at previous research to see if there is anything
         useful there that I need to pick up.
		 
   * [ ] Also app to 80khours and see where you stand

### My biggest fear from HPMOR

Already you insist on risking it! Why are you so driven? What is the real reason you must not go to Hufflepuff and be happier there? What is your true fear?"

I must achieve my full potential. If I don't I... fail...

"What happens if you fail?"

Something terrible...

"What happens if you fail?"

I don't know!

"Then it should not be frightening. What happens if you fail?"

I DON'T KNOW! BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S BAD!

There was silence for a moment in the caverns of Harry's mind.

"You know - you aren't letting yourself think it, but in some quiet corner of your mind you know just exactly what you aren't thinking - you know that by far the simplest explanation for this unverbalisable fear of yours is just the fear of losing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the people who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child prodigies..."
