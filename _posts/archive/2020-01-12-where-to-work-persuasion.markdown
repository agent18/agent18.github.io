You should go to the area where people are working on the things you
care about

## Great cities attract ambitious people

Not really a claim but looks like a circular claim. I wouldn't bother
going with it. How do you identify "great cities"? SF or cities in the
Silicon Valley could be "great cities" but based on what? start up
hub? attracting billions of funds?

If you look at Silicon Valley:

Looking at investment numbers or funding raised according to this
report [here](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/global-tech-hubs/) and [here](https://inspiration2go.de/fileadmin/user_upload/CB-Insights_Global-Tech-Hubs.pdf):

- Cumulative Dollars of funding to Hubs from Jan 2012 - May 20, 2018

	140B<span>$</span> to Silicon Valley
	72B<span>$</span> to Beijing 
	36B<span>$</span> to New York (Boston area)


Silicon Valley is a "great city". It seems to attract ambitious
people, who want to succeed? It attracted FB from Boston.

The number of startups are serios evidence that these motherfuckers
are ambitious as hell. For example all of : The Tech giants such as
Apple, Facebook, Google, UBER, Lyft, Nvidia, Intel, Instagram,
Whatsapp, Snapchat, Twitter, Netflix, Y-combinator, Tesla, Airbnb,
PayPal, SpaceX, Stripe, Snap, Udacity are all in the Silicon Valley
with their headquarters. Somehow Amazon, Microsoft are not mainly in
Silicon valley. They do have a small presence there. For example,
Microsoft has only 2000 employees out of its 145k employees in
California.


New York

## Industries cluster in certain areas

If you look at the Youtube scene or entertainers scene, apparently
3/4th of the US entertainers live in LA. A complete building [which
housed mostly Vinestars who moved into that complex in LA (back in
2014)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/hype-house-and-the-la-tiktok-mansion-gold-rush/articleshow/73131333.cms). A quick search on some of the top youtubers and where they
are now and where they were before reveals a trend that all these guys
moved to LA to "further their career". David Dobrik after graduating
high school moved to LA from Illinois to pursue his Vine career. Liza
Koshy moved from Houston to LA. King Bach from Toronto (moved to
different cities in US), Logan Paul from Ohio, Jake Paul from Ohio,
Amanda Cerny from Pennyslvania, all are some of the top youtubers and
live in LA and move to LA (I guess to further their career). If you
look at the career of Lily Singh (Superwoman), who moved in December
2015 to LA all the way from Toronto, we can guess why. Lily Singh is
now the first woman late night talk show host in 2019. Often times
(enough to remember) I have seen Logan Paul ask people to move to
LA. He did that to his x-roommate Mark Dohner, his current roomates
Mike Majlak and Evan. Somehow that seems to be where shit is going
down, according to them.

Most HOT and happening talk shows are recorded here in
California. "The Late Late show with James Corden", "Jimmy Kimmerl
Live", "Conan" all in or aound 20 mins from California. Why do they all have to
be this close? No idea. Maybe it is where people come to look for this type
of work, or maybe the people who are interviewed in these shows are
easier to reach, whatever. But somehow they seem to want to flock
together.

It's wierd and maybe not at the same time that "Last week tonight",
"the daily show with Trevor Noah", "The late show with Stephen
Colbert", and you can almost guess that the "Saturday Night Live"
would also be taped in NYC. Why NYC? maybe the audience that they
want, maybe the resources that they want are available there. Not
surprisingly all these shows are politically charged. What we saw
earlier was just shows which involved celebrities.

Somehow, Florence has been producing the most important works of art
consistently over 3 centuries despite Milan also being from Italy and
just as big and 350 km apart.

Great cities such as florence (art capital), seems to somehow be
sending the message that Art is important and people seem to be taking
to it, working on it, and sort of putting it ahead. Maybe they have
the resources needed to learn the art. Maybe they have the network
which allows to grow in that field. These are all speculations and
nevertheless, there seems to be something about living in the city
that increases your chances of producing some high quality art.

If you look at New York, it appears that it is the "Investment capital
of the world". New York is where the [Largest revenue investment
banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_investment_banks) are. Many big banks have their HQ there (Goldman Sachs, JP
Morgan and Chase, Morgan Stanley, BofA) for example. Yes there are
other "Large" banks like Barclays Investment Bank, whose headquarters
are in London. A quick look into their revenue dwarfs in comparison to
the Goldman Sachs for example. I am not saying the reason why they
"suck" is because of their location. But the fact that they are not
totally big and not in New York isn't helping its case here.

The Tech giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google, UBER, Lyft, Nvidia,
Intel, Instagram, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Twitter, Netflix, Y-combinator,
Tesla, Airbnb, PayPal, SpaceX, Stripe, Snap, Udacity are all in the
Silicon Valley with their headquarters. Somehow Amazon, Microsoft are
not mainly in Silicon valley. They do have a small presence there. For
example, Microsoft has only 2000 employees out of its 145k employees
in California.

Same story in other regions as well.

I currently live in Delft. When I lost my job in Delft, there were a
number of people contacting me and saying I needed to move to
Eindhoven and sure enough I had most of my interviews there. All the
top companies related to semiconductor industry are clustered around
Eindhoven (for some reason). ASML, Philips, NXP and many contracted
medium sized companies working for them and a gazillion recruitment
agencies working for them. And right now am working in delft and it
appears that the lack of being in Eindhoven is seriously affecting
me. I look at people who go to Eindhoven often or people who are in
Eindhoven getting better responsibilities, knowing about traineeships
through their network etc... I am literally unable to network to find
out opportunities.

Malls Hello? In Forum mall, somehow PUMA, NIKE, Reebok, and Adidas are
literally next to each other. SIDE BY SIDE. Hmm! Same thing with those
shirt brands like Louie Philip, Peter England, Van Heusen. It makes
sense in this case though I guess. I literally went to all the stores
for shopping shoes everytime I need to buy shoes or shirts. I step
foot into all stores. And they are all in the same Mall. Anyways from
a sale perspective lets say it makes money for them. 

In the city where I live, there are three-four Turkish stores in the
same "street", where we get Indian Masalas for example and there is no
more anywhere else in the city. Similarly, the center of the city has
the largest collection of Restaurants (fine dining types).

There is some force

## Persuasion: It matters what message the city sends

### First attempt examples

**Claims**: People who work with or hang with perusade you to be like
them

~~## The city sends you a message 
~~
~~That is if you are around somehow it could influence you?
~~
~~## It matters a lot, the message that the city sends
~~

I am afraid the type of people I am with, the more I feel like them. 
For example, 

The type of people you call friends seem to be the type of things you
will engage in. Six months back an STM was in town, it was
fire. Probably the most number of days I did 5 hrs a day. I think I
averaged 3 hrs or something.

In India there are so many distractions (women I meet and crave to
meet (ammu, school girls, rams wife), constant need to drink and get
wasted, so many "duties" of meeting people (rj paretns), so much time
lost. Didn't even do 1 hr. 

When I think of delft, or Netherlands in general, the type of people I
see is people who work well, but for 8 hrs only. People who talk drink
a lot of coffee and then get back to life, seemingly switching off
everything. And then go on vacations, have to drink in the
weekend. People with houses and girl friends, people biking, playing
sports regularly. 

When I think of New York, I can only think of hard ass working, hedge
funders, people in suits, all making a lot of money, slogging, over
working etc... My impression might not be right about New York.

When I think of Silicon Valley I think of people working less than new
yorkers, in giant tech firms, not sure what their msg is.

Its when I go outside to the uniersity and see couples together, its
when I am in India and that triggers those feelings, otherwise I am in
my own world. you know. In the house over the last three hours, all I
think about is basketball and this stuff and not about having girlfriends

Listening to terror tell me about his escapades with women, makes me
feel so low that I want to work on it. 

I know how I feel and try to steer away from discussions about these
things Terror for sure is banging more, but as long as I don't hear
about this side of him, I am fine. In other words his persuation
atleast goes as far as consuming my head (can't imaagine a specific
time it happened), but when San and Terror were talking only about
girls, I think I felt like I had to do smething. 

I don't feel bad about my lack of women in my life, until I meet
people with its abundance. AKA Terror. I am going to go on a roll and
say that this time I met him and avoided conversations, although my
curiosity took over in a few cases, steered away from it and had a
good time bantering.

My fear of LA is how I would feel so small when I am around those
every single model. 

My current virginity status takes the biggest hit when people
forcefully talk about it. or about their first time. IT's people who
care about it, that unfortunately I hang with, who make me want to
unvirgin myself. But in the last three days, 0 thougthst about fucking
1st world problems like Virginity. hahah This is the basketball gang.

So the people I hang out with, seem to be influencing what is
important, whether I like it or not.

You will not believe that I think I stayed in delft for this girl
mainly. When I don't text her, I couldn't care less about her. We
would have these long breaks between chats. No problem (aambla singam
de),

But sudden

Only writing comes up with ideas. you can suck dick doens't
matter. Thinking not sure what it does. It seems like I just need to
keep writing and slowly really slowly I come to the point. It came to
me about virginity. Its the solides point I have I think. 

When I am at work, and with two other stunning boys working (not their
asses off), but showing brilliance, I want to be like them. I don't
think this is an example!! Well I want to be like them, Thats good
persuasion. you know. becuase that type of ambition (or top people)
and doing good stuff is the kind of persuasion I need.

They give me that fire... The respect of my colleagues is so important
to me that I thought about the whole week in advance, canceled all my morning
plans to go swimming, showed up to work early, tried to work every
single hour, tried to work even more so that I don't loose
respect. And be ready for the stand up etc...

So my point is I guess the people you are around, shape you...

But why doens't kushiks or prnavs gf make yu want to feel it, I am so
glad I don't see them PDA, or do things to make those feelings
rise. MAybe subconciously I am feeling it. I shall not emy feelings
the next time. I am usually drunk and having a good time.

oh fuck the examples are starting to flow

Persuation is real. Then I want to surround myself with opportunities
and people who are like minded. Not fucking Asian Lee who is Bored of
her life and want's to go on vacation and drink all the
time. Jesus. Some useful persuation please. As much as I don't want
the GF thing to rub on me it does rub now and then. Especially in
India. Damn! somany beautis (with whom I supposedly had a shot with)

---

When I play basketball what I see is that loosing in the game, not
being able to make shots, people scolding me for my shit playing
forces me to practice on saturday. I think I am pursuaded by those
people to practice more ball. In the case when I am not around them,
i.e., I don't suck, I find that I couldn't care less what they thought
about me. Like for example during the week. But on Sunday when I play,
I get that feedback that tells me how shit I am. 

Then there is the virginity example

girlfriends with gf's... 

Terror 

There are plenty of cases 

I don't want to talk about my friend and his dating life? cause I am
afraid it will make me feel like shit, I stick to banter. I don't want
to know. Frankly I am curious but I stay away from it.

I think it is a play between how tangible it is for me. I can hear
about my indian friends relationship and dutch colleagues relationship
totally differently. 

Franlkly I ask my friends to not engage in PDA. I don't want them
being all lovey dovey in front of me. Get a room. I am afraid of the
persuation, or how it makes me feel. I remember this time when I third
wheeling two couples. Jesus that is the shittiest I think I have
felt. I hope I have recorded it somewher. It was new years I was alone
and these two couples around me having holding hands and the worst is
the new years kiss. I don't fucking want to see that.

What you don't see you don't feel What you see you feel.

But Marriage people getting married around you? how are you not
feeling I don't know Persuaded?

My claim is that if I hang with people like terror then fucking will
become my major prio. If I hang with them and stick to banter or
badmouthing people who are married laughing at memes, then I have got
a different kind of persuation.

Movies can be persuasive: I am sick and tired of these TV series
continuously writing an undercurrent cute love plot which is over the
top. I avoid these things cause of the persuation I think. I don't
want to listen to love songs because of the persuation, because of the
thoughts it puts in me. That is why I watch Modern Family. I don't
mind being persuaded about brotherly sisterly love. I don't mind being
persuaded about the love a father has for his daughter. I don't mind
being persuaded loooking at black people suffering. I want to be
amidst EA people. I want to be among the smartest brains and become
smarter. I want to surround my self and work my ass off.

I watch Last man Standing and Modern Family, they are more about
family and not about serious love (which at this point I dispise). The
more I look at this shit, the more I feel like them people. 

Will moving help me? maybe. Will working at an EAO help me. that I
definitely think so.

**Anamolies**

Rob is not ambitious?

No one is ambitious in here.

I am not saying Koen will become like them if he works with them, but
working with them, where I need to do better... but he will probably
be persuaded to think like them to long for their respect and there by
improve. Be more meticulous. 

No idea why I am not feeling like I should get married. Could it be
that I am persuaded?

**Should you visit an EA HUB?**

Check the article out:

https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpQqh6wCDtfZkeneg/should-you-visit-an-ea-hub

It's called Value Drift. What a word pandian.

Giving What We Can are currently looking for volunteers, for their
2015 summer internship programme, as is the Global Priorities
Project. If youâ€™d like to do an internship, or just have some
questions youâ€™d like to ask, you can contact Tara Mac Aulay in Oxford,
or visit bayrationality.com and contact someone on there. And of
course, we are always happy to answer any questions you may have: via
Peterâ€™s or Brentonâ€™s email.

Everytime I learn about people like Tara MAc Aulay, I feel like shit
and want to be as awesome as them. 


Persuation depends on memory of carrot and stick of the event.
I am so pumped about going swimming tomorrow. The memory is fresh upon
how badly I suck. During my off time while writing I watched youtube
videos on how to breathe and not fucking hell's kitchen. 

### Keep examples

Isn't it weird that only on the day of Diwali and days leading to it,
I feel like I want to burst crackers. Like I mean the next day, I
couldn't care less. Just the next day. Hmmm. If cracker bursting is so

### PG

- Identify the different claims (look at STM articles and PG articles)

**Claims**: Great cities attract ambitious people

**Claims**: It matters what message the city sends you

You can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote about
earlier: the case of the Milanese Leonardo. Practically every
fifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence,
even though Milan was just as big. People in Florence weren't
genetically different, so you have to assume there was someone born in
Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo. What happened to him?

If even someone with the same natural ability as Leonardo couldn't
beat the force of environment, do you suppose you can?

**Claims**: No matter how determined you are, it's hard not to be
influenced by the people around you.

I have struggled to feel motivated to work on this. I feel like when
an STM is aorund challenging me, motivation is automatic. I need to
pull my shit together. Is it any surprise that when STM was listening
I did ABC and when ??? not sure this is a real example.

**Claims**: Each city tends to focus on one type of ambition

**Claims**: not all cities send a message

- then use all the examples I have to put it there

- finally recognize anamolies (such as arranged marriage, not being
  detered by it)
  
**Claims**: All great cities inspire some sort of ambition

**Claims**: What cities provide is an audience, and a funnel for peers

**Claims**: For some kinds of work, all you need is a handful of
talented colleagues.

**Claims**: It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology that
the larger environment matters

It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the larger
environment matters. In these the best practitioners aren't
conveniently collected in a few top university departments and
research labsâ€”partly because talent is harder to judge, and partly
because people pay for these things, so one doesn't need to rely on
teaching or research funding to support oneself. It's in these more
chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city: you need the
encouragement of feeling that people around you care about the kind of
work you do, and since you have to find peers for yourself, you need
the much larger intake mechanism of a great city.

It's when you move on to the next and much harder step that it helps
most to be in a place where you can find peers and encouragement. You
seem to be able to leave, if you want, once you've found both. The
Impressionists show the typical pattern: they were born all over
France (Pissarro was born in the Carribbean) and died all over France,
but what defined them were the years they spent together in Paris.


Good boy pan indian pandian




aristocracy neandrithals


### STM

**Claims**: People change your values just by talking to you


Carrot and stick

**Claims**: Atleast it hurts when you don't have the values of people
around you

Peoples disapproval hurts

Others get rewarded for X

**Claims**: No punishment/reward for own goals.

**Claims**: my value for something is decided by the present rewards
and my memory of rewards in the near past

**Claims**: If desire is caused by my memory of rewards, then a lack
of rewards for a while should fade my memory and thus my desire.

GYM example

**Claims**: Talking to people changes your views.

Boy does that sound innocent

**Claims**: You donâ€™t have to experience rewards or punishments by
yourself. Just observing somebody else get them can stir desire or
fear.

**Claims**: It didnâ€™t matter that they needed it badly and I didnâ€™t or
that I had my own agenda to pursue. Whether I liked it or not, I ended
up absorbing their values.

**Claims**: Thereâ€™s a reason why people from one field donâ€™t usually
talk to people from other fields.

hatâ€™s probably not a comparison he wants to encourage in his mind,
especially when heâ€™s stuck at night debugging bullshit code that
somebody wrote years ago and is minutes away from giving up.

Lesson: Separate yourself from people who talk about stuff other than your desired goals.

Or else they might start praising parties or ridiculing your
blackheads. And we all know where that ends. (Yes, I bought the
package.)



## EA is clustering around SFO and Oxford

The most interesting for me is the EA community. I want to see if they
are clustering or what is it they are doing.

In the EA side, GiveWell (San Francisco), Open Philanthropy project
(San Franscisco), 80khours (Oxford and SF), Open AI (SF), MIRI
(Berkeley), Center for Applied Rationality (Berkeley), AI Impact
(Berkeley), Animal Charity Evaluator (Berkeley without any office
space), Evidence Action (Washington DC), Center for study of existential
risk (Cambridge), Future of Humanity Institute (Cambridge), Global
Priorities Institute (Oxford), Sentience Institute (London), Giving
What We Can (Oxford) are all supposed to be close together but they
are not? Why did 80khours move

Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in (Seattle in Washington)

And Sam heck this doesn't seem to be an Anamoly. Berkeley to SFO is 20
miles apart. 

It is scattered between California and UK is what I would say and not
anything more. Although, there is seems to be a modest formation

Coming to EA, the EA conferences (unsure who all attend), seem to
happen in two locations: SFO and London only. Why I wonder. 

and also the EA forums etv..




Umm, but scientific discoveries don't seemt to flock regions. Hmmm. 

As PG says, there is a force and you woudn't want to fight such a
force rather, go along with it and use it to further your prospects.

Recently 80khours seems to have moved all the way from Oxford to LA.

My colleargues most of whom are really good at waht they do, go home
and seem to be suggesting that they do something completely different,
like talking to gf or other things.

It appears that I should be in the silicon valley. 80khours moved to SV.

If there exists such
a community, then I would want to be around there, in search of
opportunities and persuasion.


## Bay Area is THE HUB

Number of players in Bay Area needs to be listed.


http://www.bayrationality.com/

seems to suggest there are some events happening conducted by
CFAR, Berkeley EA community group

https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpQqh6wCDtfZkeneg/should-you-visit-an-ea-hub

^^ Suggests 

Of the 14 surveyed Australian EAs that went on such a trip, 12 thought
that it would increase their overall impact.[2] Only 2 didnâ€™t think it
was worth their resources as a charitable act. 9 are currently in
Oxford, London or San Francisco. Itâ€™s best to skim through Footnote 1
to get an idea of how the group found the experience.

It's on the EA Forum. It is written by Brenton Mayer (Director of
recruiting 80khours) and Peter Mcintyre (co-head of coaching)

EA places are "close by" (1hr) even if I am in Silicon Valley.


Compared to events and shitty website maintained at rotterdam or
amsterdam.

	
## You will get Persuaded

If I find one person of the 14 to have similar baselines as me?

## Conclusion

1. Working with top smart EA people in a top EAO anywhere in the world

2. Working in Bay Area with access to EA

3. Working in Silicon Valley with access to EA

4. Working with smart people in a top EAO like Open Phil within Sf
   area
   
   4>1>2>3
   
   Is what I think...

# Others to consider later+++++++++++++++++++++++
## Anamolies

KSI Casey neistat youtube

can't say the IB in oxford is an anamoly, it has its revenue dwarfed.

What about  universities and acheivements in the field of research,
pretty much it seems to be scattered around.

Silicon valley is the tech hub

people vs region/city

PG wouldn't fight such a force but use it to help himself instead.

Youtubers

So many vacancies in EA Community but not one in San Jose though.


So anomalies are thigns that we look at and see that theydon't reflect
the rule. Here we want to try and see why it is not true that 



## Not all industries cluster

The academic research industry seems to be all out wide and happening
in various places. 

Apparently it is enough to have your peers who are good to succeed.

It doesn't look like the top professors cluster around a region. 

For example if we look at happiology

In academics, i.e., paper publishing universe... PG says it doesn't
cluster. Hmmm. What does that mean?

I look at Anders Ericsson the seeming pioneer of the whole Talent is
overrated movement. I look at the people he is coauthoring with. We
can look at who all are citing him.

A professor usually runs or participates in a department. If the
professor has very high citations (he is probably old) then he is
considered a worthy person of hubbing. What I am trying to say is, if
the claim is true, there should atleast be his co-authors and people
around that movement in the close proximity (say within the state). 

Every university has dozens of departments. Check! Netherlands has TU
Delft, TU Eindhoven, University of Nijmegen etc... Where is the
question of Math departments or physic departments or mechanical
departments grouping together?

There are a gazillion universities, and somehow if we look at the most
sucesful departments there is no reason that they should all be close
by. Let's look at where the ivy league schools for MBA are at. How
about that? Somehow there is a reputation for which MBA school is
top. Let's look at that son. 

For lack of any other metric I look at this IVY league. But I think
they are the most sought after (dubbed as most prestigious). or where
people could do an Econ Phd that is totally in tattters. There are top
10 and top20 schools. no question.

There are a gazillion tech companies, but then we are looking at the
most successful tech companies.

Universities seem to be spread across the 

https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/economics-econometrics

When I look at the top 10 universities for econ phd on usnews they
seem to be mostly within 500km at the east coast and some universities
in the west coast and some in UK. 

http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/global-mba-ranking-2019

When I look at the top 10 unversities for MBA you have Stanford and
Harvard at opposite ends of the US and then Insead in France and
London Business school in UK, followed by Chicago, MIT, Columbia, Yale
and California. It appears that MIT, Harvard, Columbia and Yale are
within 200km of each other. And the rest not really close to each
other. This 250km seems to be quite large as well compared to what we
see in the Silicon Valley. 

By cluster I think of examples such as Eindhoven and Delft (its more
than a 120 km away and they are known for completely different things
Eindhoven is a hub for high tech, so many companies around it. Where
as Delft doesn't come under high tech. Eindhovens high tech does not
bleed as far as Delft. San Jose to Menlo park is 50 km (30 min
ride). Close by.

The founding fathers of Positive Psycology, an important movement on
the science of happiness, are all in different parts of the
country. Christopher is from University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Mihaly
is from Claremont (California), and Martin is from UPenn.

If you look at the field of understanding skills the top players
(noted by say citations) seem to be Michelene T.H. Chi, and Anders
Ericsson. One of whom is from Arizona State and the other from Florida
state. Following the co-authors I see more people from even further
such as Queen's university. 

Such a load of bullshit until now:


If you look at top citations in the field of cognitive psycology:

1. University of York Canada
2. University of Roehamton Uk
3. Carnegie Melon University, Philadelphia, US
4. Princeton
5. Michigan
6. California
7. Washington
8. Florida etc...

So widely varying.

Somehow in this case the industry doesn't need it and yet they come up
with these great things.







## 80khours reasons to move because

- 3/4 US entertainers live in LA. 

- The worldâ€™s ten largest urban economic regions hold only 6.5% of the
  worldâ€™s population, but account for 57% of patented innovations, 53%
  of the most cited scientists and 43% of economic output. This
  suggests that, in terms of innovation and economic output, the
  people in these regions are about eight times more productive than
  the average person.

- They are the most productive

"It seems to suggest you'll be more likely to make a breakthrough if
you move to these regions."

- Weâ€™ve certainly advised people who saw major boosts to their careers
  after moving city.
  
- Where you live determines the type of people you'll spend time
  with. It determine your security in retirement. 
  
## Startups should move to Silicon Valley

https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/08/why-some-startups-move-to-the-bay-area-but-most-stay-put/567314/

Based primarily on: http://www.paulgraham.com/startuphubs.html

PG seems to vouch to startups, that they have the best bet of success
even more than in Boston, only when they come to Silicon Valley.

> The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley is
> not even a nationalistic one. [1] It's the same thing I say to
> startups in the US. Y Combinator alternates between coasts every 6
> months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston. And even though
> Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world),
> we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to
> move to Silicon Valley. If that's true of Boston, it's even more
> true of every other city.

PG says, time and again he has seen VC's in Boston be conservative,
not aggressive with pursuing a funding for a startup. "By the time the
Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already gone. The
way you get big returns is not by trying to avoid losses, but by
trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. And the big hits often
look risky at first."

Facebook was started in Boston. Boston VCs said no and FB moved to
Silicon Valley and raised money there. We all know how much FB is
worth today.

Looking at investment numbers or funding raised according to this
report [here](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/global-tech-hubs/) and [here](https://inspiration2go.de/fileadmin/user_upload/CB-Insights_Global-Tech-Hubs.pdf):

- Cumulative Dollars of funding to Hubs from Jan 2012 - May 20, 2018

	140B<span>$</span> to Silicon Valley
	72B<span>$</span> to Beijing 
	36B<span>$</span> to New York (Boston area)
  	
- Number of rounds with greater than 100M<span>$</span> at Silicon
  Valley
  
	  158 for Silicon Valley
	  40 for New York
	  etc...
	  
Silicon Valley seems far more superior. Yes there are growing areas
which are startup Hubs such as Stockholm, Amsterdam, Tel Aviv, London
etc... but none seem to compare to the "supremacy" of the one and only
Silicon Valley, in terms of Big risk VC's and billions of dollors of
funding.

With some exceptions it is maybe better to move to another area or
stay put such as: if your are in the entertainment startup scene maybe
you might want to be in New York or LA. If you have a good investor
who has committed to fund you, you should probably stay where you are.

Summary being Bold investors are here for you. 

The above seems so great for for-profits. What about the non-profits
though? Will MacAskill, co-founder of 80khours and Centre for
Effective Altruism informs [here](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/), from his experience at
Y-combinator says that, Y-combinator might not be the space for getting
funding.

>80,000 Hours raised a little bit of funding, but didnâ€™t prioritise it
>after Demo Day because the time investment to raise a dollar of
>funding from YC introductions seemed much greater than from other
>funding avenues we had.

But they continue to have a small presence (2 out of 10 people) in
California (Berkeley and San Francisco) working for them while most of
them seem to be in Oxford where they originated from.

80khours and Centre for Effective Altruism went through
Ycombinator. Both are co-founded by the same person Will
MacAskill. [Here](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/) Will writes about if people should go through
Y-combinator. 

Moreover, 80khours doesn't seem to be a startup anymore (a startup has
found a business model and a product that is right for the market, it
stops being a startup and graduates to an enterprise.).

## content

It appears that where you live could be quite important atleast in the
beginning and middle years says PG. He gives examples of how Florence
is the capital for art and not a very similarly large city, Milan. 

New York is the banking capital. If you want to do investment banking
that's where you should go. The headquarters of JP morgan and chase,
Goldman Sacks and Morgan Stanley (The top firms in IB) are from New
york. But why! ;). 

A good number of youtubers are found in LA. David Dobrik moved from X
to LA. Logan Paul moved from Ohio to LA. Liza Koshy moved from X to
LA. There are counter examples from UK such as KSI (as big as
LP). 1600 vine is the hottest place where LP Amanda Cerny, King Mach
and many such youtubers lived. I often find in their videos that they
ask people to move to LA. Some examples of such people are Mike Majlak
and Evan and Mark Dohner, all of whom moved to LA upon the advice of
LP. It appears that if you want to be a big internet star you need to
be around there. Maybe its the auditions, the people you meet
etc... Even Lily Singh from Canada moved to LA, to "further her
career". She's a late night host. 

All late late shows seem to be recorded in LA. LA seems to be the
Celibrity, internet capital of the world.

Startup scene is hot in... you guessed it.... 

Somehow similar people need to flock together, despite their
capabilities standing for itself.

Persuation is real. Then I want to surround myself with opportunities
and people who are like minded. Not fucking Asian Lee who is Bored of
her life and want's to go on vacation and drink all the
time. Jesus. Some useful persuation please. As much as I don't want
the GF thing to rub on me it does rub now and then. Especially in
India. Damn! somany beautis (with whom I supposedly had a shot with)

Coming to EA, the EA conferences (unsure who all attend), seem to
happen in two locations: SFO and London only. Why I wonder. 

Umm, but scientific discoveries don't seemt to flock regions. Hmmm. 

As PG says, there is a force and you woudn't want to fight such a
force rather, go along with it and use it to further your prospects.

Recently 80khours seems to have moved all the way from Oxford to LA.

My colleargues most of whom are really good at waht they do, go home
and seem to be suggesting that they do something completely different,
like talking to gf or other things.

It appears that I should be in the silicon valley. 80khours moved to SV.

Every area produces a particular kind of people. Florence for example
for artists. Newyork for business men. Not a coincidence that all
banks have their HQ in NewYork. NAC that my friend went to NY to make
money in IB. It's called the New York Stock exchange.

What about  universities and acheivements in the field of research,
pretty much it seems to be scattered around.

Delft vs ASML

Silicon valley is the tech hub

people vs region/city

PG wouldn't fight such a force but use it to help himself instead.

Youtubers

So many vacancies in EA Community not in San Jose though.

## Persuation 

You know, I was reading today: https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/

"80,000 Hours and the Centre for Effective Altruism are doing well by
non-profit standards. If we surrounded ourselves only with non-profit
people, there would be a temptation to coast.  But at group office
hours, Iâ€™d often feel like one of the least competent people in the
room; and the organization I was helping run was doing merely fine by
YC startup standards. This pushed me to work even harder and optimize
my time even further."

This is so exhausting for pandian who works barely 8 hours during the
day goes to gym. Spends time on youtube for an hour after coming
home. So sad, to note what I am today.

Where is the ambition?

where is my persuation?

Maybe you will get shit done once you are being persuaded.???


## Plot

But what is the central question. The central question seems to be
about where I should work. Should I move to California? will it help?
Should I invest in this moving and why? 

So we start with the basics. 

So industries seem cluster in certain regions. Great! And in these
regions, boy oh boy, do we have those ambitious people coming at their
clusters. We would like to be around such ambitious people cause they
persuade us to be ambitious and do great things. We see that EA is
clustering around SFO and Oxford. Bay Area seems to be the better hub
(happening etc...).

I need to be around my hub I think, maybe take a trip to the hub. Meet
people, network just like the 14 Australians did. I want to go to
ambitious cities. I want to persuaded to do great things. I want my
value to not be reduced.

Caveats: You will meet ambitious people more than you do here. I am
totally afraid so. With the

It's only when I meet my colleagues here do I think I should put extra
effort and gain their respect. Its when I see them leading teams is
when I try to be like them, be in control. I think of being like them.

## Industries Cluster in certain areas

**Entertainers**

Three-quarters of the US entertainers live in LA. There is even a
special building at [1600 Vine street in Hollywood LA, where internet
stars move into to pursue fame](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/business/hollywood-apartment-social-media.html). A quick look at the early life of
some of the top Youtubers reveals that most of them have moved to LA
to "further their career".

Most hot and happening talk shows are recorded here in California:
"The Late Late show with James Corden", "Jimmy Kimmel Live",
"Conan". All, in or around 20 mins from LA. Why do they all have to be
this close? Maybe, it is where people come to look for this type of
work, or maybe the people who are interviewed in these shows are
easier to reach, or whatever. But somehow they seem to want to flock
together.

However, "Last week tonight", "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah", "The
late show with Stephen Colbert", are all filmed in NYC. You can go
ahead and guess that the "Saturday Night Live" would also be taped in
NYC. Unlike the shows that are taped in LA, these shows are all
politically charged and seem to want to be in NYC. Why NYC? Maybe that
is where they have the right type of audience, or interviewees or even
time zone w.r.t Washington, which could be somehow important. I don't
know.

**Art**

> Florence is called the capital of arts; according to statistics
> produced by UNESCO, 60% of the world's most important works of art
> are located in Italy and approximately half of these are in
> Florence. From the 13th to the 16th century it was a seemingly

> website](http://www.aboutflorence.com/art-and-culture-of-Florence.html)

Somehow, Florence has been producing the most important works of art
consistently over 3 centuries despite Milan also being from Italy and
just as big and 350 km apart (as pointed out by PG).

**Finance**

If you look at New York, it appears that it is the "Investment capital
of the world". New York is where the [Largest revenue investment
banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_investment_banks) are. Many big banks have their HQ there (Goldman Sachs, JP
Morgan and Chase, Morgan Stanley, BofA) for example. Yes there are
other "large" banks like Barclays Investment Bank, whose headquarters
are in London. A quick look into their revenue dwarfs in comparison to
the Goldman Sachs for example. I am not saying the reason why they
"suck" is because of their location. But the fact that they are not
totally big and not in New York isn't helping its case here.

**Technology giants**

The Tech giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google, UBER, Lyft, Nvidia,
Intel, Instagram, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Twitter, Netflix, Y-combinator,
Tesla, Airbnb, PayPal, SpaceX, Stripe, Snap, Udacity are all in the
Silicon Valley with their headquarters. Somehow Amazon, Microsoft are
not mainly in Silicon valley. They do have a small presence there. For
example, Microsoft has only 2000 employees out of its 145k employees
in California. But the rest seem to be flocking in here.

**EA**

The most interesting for me is the EA community. I want to see if they
are clustering or what is it they are doing.

In the EA side the "top" organizations that 80khours has listed
[here](https://80000hours.org/2018/10/2018-talent-gaps-survey/#who-was-sampled), GiveWell (San Francisco), Open Philanthropy project (San
Franscisco), 80khours (Oxford and SF), Open AI (SF), MIRI (Berkeley),
Center for Applied Rationality (Berkeley), AI Impact (Berkeley),
Animal Charity Evaluator (Berkeley without any office space), Evidence
Action (Washington DC), Center for study of existential risk (Oxford),
Future of Humanity Institute (Oxford, UK), Global Priorities Institute
(Oxford), Sentience Institute (London), Giving What We Can (Oxford),
Founder Pledge (London), Centre for Effective Altruism (Oxford). These
are other top organizations listed by GiveWell: Against Malaria
Foundation (St. Albans UK), Helen Keller International (Washington
D.C), Sightsavers (U.K), Others: Give Directly (NYC), Poverty Action
Lab (Cambridge, MA, US), Good Food Institute (Washington D.C, US),
Animal Equality (US UK), Center for Global Development (Washington
D.C, US), Founders Pledge (London).

80khours and Centre for Effective Altruism went through the
[Y-combinator startup program in 2015 and 2017](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/) respectively. At
that point 80khours even moved to Silicon Valley and not has a small
presence there i.e., two of the 8 people work there.

So for the EA community it looks like UK and Bay Area (SF) could be
considered as hubs I guess. These regions are the only regions that
host the [annual EA conferences](https://www.eaglobal.org/) unsurprisingly.

**Tech in my region**

In Netherlands, all the top companies related to precision engineering
industry within the Netherlands are clustered around Eindhoven (for
some reason). ASML, Philips, NXP and many contracted medium sized
companies working for them and a gazillion recruitment agencies
working for them. 100km away from the City there are very few jobs
related to the semiconductor industry.

**Malls/Supermarkets in my region**

In Forum mall, Chennai, somehow PUMA, NIKE, Reebok, and Adidas are
literally next to each other. SIDE BY SIDE. Hmm! Same thing with those
shirt brands like Louie Philip, Peter England, Van Heusen. It makes
sense in this case though I guess. I literally went to all the stores
for shopping shoes everytime I need to buy shoes or shirts. I step
foot into all stores. And they are all in the same Mall. Anyways from
a sale perspective lets say it makes money for them.

In the city where I live, there are three-four Turkish stores in the
same "street", where we get Indian Masalas for example and there is no
more anywhere else in the city. Similarly, the center of the city has
the largest collection of Restaurants (fine dining types).

## ~~Great Cities~~ Clusters attract ambitious people 

The worldâ€™s ten largest urban economic regions hold only 6.5% of the
worldâ€™s population, but account for 57% of patented innovations, 53%
of the most cited scientists and 43% of economic output. This
suggests that, in terms of innovation and economic output, the
people in these regions are about eight times more productive than
the average person.

Silicon Valley, Paris, Berlin, and Denver-Boulder also deserve a
mention as having some of the highest rates of innovation per person.
  
**Silicon Valley as startup and tech hub**

In a region like Silicon Valley the Tech and startup hub, there seems
to be a lot of attraction from ambitious people.

There is little doubt that Silicon Valley is a great region as it is
the biggest funding pot for startups with 140B<span>$</span> funded
from 2012 to 2018. This is 3.8 times bigger than the next top funding
hub Boston. This seems to be attracting top minds (as evidenced by the
success) to its region.

A top example is Facebook. The current tech giant in 2004, was passed
on by Battery Ventures from Boston after two meetings at Charles and
one last meeting at their offices, it still didn't work out. Whereas
	the meeting with Peter Thiel in California led to a deal in a
day. Apparently Boston VCs are slow and afraid to make those big hits
that could potentially get you big returns. Whereas Silicon Valley
valley boast otherwise. As a result, Paul Graham can be seen preaching
to startups during his Y-Combinator Boston rounds that they need to
move to Silicon Valley to have the biggest bet for success.

Looking at the tech world we see that in the last few decades the top
tech companies end up with Silicon Valley as an important hub for
their actions. The Tech giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google, UBER,
Lyft, Nvidia, Intel, Instagram, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Twitter, Netflix,
Y-combinator, Tesla, Airbnb, PayPal, SpaceX, Stripe, Snap, Udacity are
all in the Silicon Valley with their headquarters. Somehow Amazon,
Microsoft are not mainly in Silicon valley. They do have a small
presence there. For example, Microsoft has only 2000 employees out of
its 145k employees in California. But for the rest the best of the
best are having their hub in Silicon Valley.

**Finance**

When I talk to friends in the field of finance wanting to make big
bucks, the only place they can think of and pursue is NYC and in
Investment Banking. 

**Entertainment**

It is known that people move to these regions. Its a fact.

David Dobrik moved to LA from Illinois to pursue his Vine Career,
right after high school. Right now he has 6 million views everyday and
has risen to 15 million subscribers in a matter of 4 years. At the
time he moved to LA (at the age of 19), groceries of 25<span>$</span>
was a lot of money for him. Today he can be seeing buying his friends
Lamborginis even.

Lily Singh moved in December 2015 to LA all the way from
Toronto. Today she is the first woman late night talk show host. 

Liza Koshy, from Houston, King Bach from Toronto, Logan and Jake Paul
from Ohio, Amanda Cerny from Pennsylvania etc... All of them are some
top youtubers (>10million subs) and all of them moved to LA.

Often times I have seen in videos of Logan Paul where he makes people
move to LA. He did this with his friend Mark Dohner, his current
roommates Mike Majlak and Evan. All with the intention that somehow
the key to a greater life is in the city.

**EA**

In [this](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpQqh6wCDtfZkeneg/should-you-visit-an-ea-hub) article 14 people have been to an EA hub (SF and Oxford)
and out of which 9 of them are in the EA hubs (Oxford, London, SF bay
area).

Peter McIntyre who co-founded EA Australia, which has raised over
3M<span>$</span> for EA work, seems to have found his way as director
of Recruiting in 80khours Oxford.

Brenton Mayer who also co-founded EA Australia, is now in 80khours in
Berekeley as Co-head of Coaching. 

[Tara MacAulay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/), managed to introduce her system in the hospital she was
working at saving over [a million dollars a year](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/tara/). She moved to
Oxford and later to CEA as part of her work as a chief in the Centre
for Effective Altruism.

There are another 6 people who have similar stories probably but are
in positions at the "top" EAOs (as declared by 80khours, such as
Centre for Effective Altruism). 

So atleast there is some evidence that these are seeming ambitious
people moving to the hubs.


## Ambition is contagious provided dot dot dot

**Personal life**

Such as the ambition of colleagues, the ambition of the people you
meet.

**EA?**
Just like what the 14 other people from Australia explained. 

**Lack of ambition is also contagious?**


## Persuasion: It matters what message a city sends

Persuasion is when you let go of your current values to absorb the
values of other people without you even noticing it.

<!-- **New Year's King's Day, trying to succeed socially** -->

I never did anything before 2015 for New Year's (age of 24). At max I
would play at a hotel for some money or food. And just once I really
went out for the new year. Mostly I spent it at home sleeping and it
was totally ok, when I was in India. I didn't feel pressured and
didn't feel bad at all.

Somehow from then until 2015 something seems to have changed. In 2014
August, I moved to Netherlands and when December started coming, I
started panicking. All the people were leaving to their home towns and
a lot of people were making plans for New Year's Eve. I had
none. People in my dorm left to their home towns. So it either meant
staying in my dorm room or going to the City Center alone. But both
seem to spell out disaster. I mean, I was going to look hopeless when
people ask me what I did for New Year's. So I spent 600â‚¬ (approx.)
despite my dad saying NO (it was his money), and managed to go to UK
to my cousins house from 18th December. I was hoping to study there,
but I couldn't, so I came back on 22nd December. But hey, atleast I
would have a story to tell people.

I remember this conversation after university started again in January
with three friends (this is 2014 and now we are in 2020 and yet I
remember even now who all were there vividly). They popped the
question during break. "So Agent18, what did you do for the New
Year". I somehow managed with this UK travel and they didn't dig
deep. Phew! A sense of relief passed by. It seems like it was all
building up for this one moment. Another friend talked about how he
hitch hiked and smoked pot in the car with his girlfriend. It was a
mad story. I was so envious. Why was I not like that.

It was not just that New Year, but all New Year's that have happened
hence forth. One new year I purposely came to Netherlands on the 31st,
just so that when people asked me what I did for New Years, I could
tell them I just came home and was tired. This 2020, when my colleague
said he is back on 2nd, the first thing that ran in my mind is fuck I
have to deal with "what did you do for the New Year's?" question.

In India most of them (colleagues from IIT or most friends that I
had), seemed to not care about it. But here the topic is around, there
is a buzz in the common kitchen. And the dreaded question, "What did
you do for New Year's?" is right around the corner. That seems to be
the main difference and that I somehow succumb to it. Whether you like
it or not there seems to be pressure anyway. Somehow I care about what
those question posers think about me. Agent18 is not cool. or Somehow
I think I should go out on New Year's and have a story to tell.

I don't think this was an isolated incident. I took quite some effort
to celebrate something called King's Day. Everyone was doing something
for it. My dorm members, the Tamil gang I knew, my university
colleagues, everybody was doing it. It appeared ludicrous to not do
anything for it. I wore orange just like everyone, worked hard on
finding a group and trotted around different cities. Success. Contrast
that to what I did for Chinese New Year (another celebration I didn't
know much about). NOTHING. WHY? It was not as popular I guess, not
many people seemed to be concerned with it around me. My dorm members
didn't talk about celebrating it, nor did the Tamil gang I knew, nor
did the University colleagues. No one asked me, "Bro how was your
Chinese New Year?".

**If staying closer causes persuation, staying away might cause
non-persuasion** **Persuasion reduces with strength of the memory**

This time when I went to India, a lot of people I met were talking
about CAA, politics. Just this particular day, my friend and I are
together for the whole day meeting different people. We meet another
friend and they began talking with one another about politics,
laughing and making jokes about someone and I didn't get any of it. I
was discouraged to ask questions as I didn't get any response. I had
nothing to contribute and felt like I didn't belong and would belong
better if I brushed up my politics. We hopped to another setting with
another crowd and there again the same topic erupted. By the end of
the night I was asking him how I can stay abreast all these topics,
what sources I should use etc...

However now, after a month, I am the exact same guy who never really
cared about keeping abreast the situations in India. 

I think the way I see forward is to make a choice on what persuasions
to allow. I am in no place I think, to have girlfriends. I should be
working on important things and them only. I conciously stay away from
love songs, movies about love, sitcoms about love. I have friends who
are studs with girls. I am friends with them unfortunately, but focus
on staying away from any discussions that might relate to who all he
slept with. My MO is banter, useless banter such as talking about
tamil serials and how stupid it is etc... I think this is working as I
remember the last time we talked about girls how I felt and this time
when I talked to him how I felt. I didn't feel like shit anymore. :)

Things related to practicing hard, triumphant moments of great people,
people doing good for people, and sitcoms such as Seinfeld and Modern
Family, are all things that I happily welcome into my life. I welcome
listening to the tamil songs where they talk shit about women and
about how relationship sucks. I don't mind being fed these values.

<!-- **Persuasion is very subtle. It sneaks up on you without you even -->
<!-- realizing it.** -->

Persuasion is very subtle in its form. It sneaks up on you in places
you never expect. I was watching Youtube bites of "Hey Steve". I find
the hosts reaction extremely funny. So, I was bingeing these 2 min
videos one after the other. The format is that the audience, filled
with a lot of beautiful women, would ask the host help on their
relationships. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NunpJODvNA) video of this women discussing about how her
husband should dress more sexily like the host was the last video I
watched. The audience were going crazy applauding. The host was giving
funny reactions etc... I decided it was time to go get some food, when
all of a sudden this thought hit me: "It would be nice to have a
girlfriend. I should start with dating some Indian chick". 

Huh? Where did that come from. It could be random. But what I don't
understand is that when last Saturday when I was on a roll working
more than 6 hours on the weekend inside my house, why I didn't think
about dating an Indian chick. It didn't help me stay away despite this
being an old couple (60-70 year olds).

**Persuasion based on memory**
Persuasion continues to haunt you as long or as strong as the memory
is. I started playing Basketball 2 years back and noticed how much I
suck on the court. I noticed that when I make difficult shots, score
many points people appreciate it (hi-fi's, audible gasps of
appreciation etc...). It was never in my agenda to become good in
basketball a few years back (might I note, not like Kobe Bryant or NBA
level, atleast as good as the guys I play with). Now you can see me
every saturday at the court, practicing seriously on making shots,
certain dribbles etc... Last Saturday though, when I went to the court
to practice, I didn't feel motivated (it had been one week since I
last sucked, I did suck though). On Sunday when I went to play, I
converted 0 shots from outside, missed layups even. all this in front
of this amazing player who could get me a buy-in with more adult
players. Today is Tuesday and you can find me thinking about moves I
would do in the court as soon as I close my eyes and what all I need
to practice this Saturday. You can find me thinking about whether I
should add another day of practice. You can find me cringing at the
thought that I am injured and might have to give up basketball. I was
persuaded as long as the memory of how much I suck and needed to
improve is ripe and fresh in my mind. A month in India and I don't
feel persuaded at all about basketball. Like I couldn't care less
about becoming better.

This need of getting better has increased in the recent days. I often find
myself thinking about how to play in the court. Before sleeping, when
riding a bike. 

Also CAA, Terror playboy etc...

 So, I never wanted
to be good in basketball a few years back. But now I feel persuaded to
practice due to the looks I get when I miss, and due to the looks
others get when they nail a shot I guess. As a result of sucking
pretty good on the games I play on Sunday, I decided to practice on
Saturdays (Persuasion, guys). Last saturday for example when I went to
the court to practice, I realized I didn't remember where all I sucked
(it was a week ago). I shot a bit and then said fuck this and went to
play a game a bit and then left. The point I am trying to make is I
"lost my persuasion"" to get better.

Last Saturday though, when I went to the court to practice, I didn't
feel motivated (it had been one week since I last sucked; I did suck
though). I didn't remember where all I sucked. And I just gave up a
bit later, after doing random things. On Sunday when I went to play, I
converted 0 shots from outside, missed layups even. And all this in
front of this amazing player who could get me a buy-in with more adult
players. That was enough to re-kindle the fire. Today is Tuesday and
you can find me thinking about moves I would do in the court as soon
as I close my eyes and what all I need to practice this Saturday. You
can find me thinking about whether I should add another day of
practice. You can find me cringing at the thought that I am injured
and might have to give up basketball. I was persuaded as long as the
memory of how much I suck and needed to improve is ripe and fresh in
my mind. A month in India and I don't feel persuaded at all about
basketball. Like I couldn't care less about becoming better.  <!-- You
can cure your existing persuasion, you can isolate or you can --> <!--
substitute it with new ones-->

When I went to India recently everyone was talking about the CAA
bill. People were protesting. My friends were all talking about it,
and I couldn't offer shit. It was this particular day when I was
visiting people with this friend that I felt persuaded more than
ever. Everyone we visited was talking about CAA and homie could
eloquently explain what was wrong with the CAA, how to combat it and
was giving examples from the past. The thing is everyone was
respecting him and arguing with him (and NOT ME). By the end of that
very night, I couldn't bear it and asked him what I could do to
improve my knowledge on politics. Luckily I left the country a few
days later. I am mostly in the presence of white people who couldn't
care less about the CAA. Except on twitter no one really "told me"
that I sucked because I didn't know politics in India. Now I am
completely cured of that persuasion until the next time.

**Instances where it doens't persuade you**

people getting married around me

**Visiting an EA hub persuasion**

**Avaoiding persuasion**

Some how I am being insulated after a while and didn't pursue any of
those above. For example the CAA stuff. <!-- fll in stuff -->. You
see. I need my insualation to get back to real life and I need time
seems to allow me to do that. 

To conclude what we need is not the persuasion of playboyness, or
basketball shotting or working great in design engineering. I need my
EA support. If this is true for cunts like this, its got to be true
for EA madness.

**Finale**

Separate yourself from people who talk about stuff other than your
desired goals. Because whether we like it or not we end up being
persuaded. 


I think with this part I want to convey two things!

- First thing is that great cities attract ambitious people and that
  in the end you will be fed with their persuasion.
  
- Secondly, potentially the first point is that we easily get
  persuaded, when we are around people. Our values change
  
- They last as long as the memory of when people are around is frequent

anamolies: marriage don't feel like marrying


**Persuasion**

So Persuasion is real. Persuasion is subtle. Persuasion 

Msg that a city sends to me is tough to run with. Other than take the
word of PG. But I think the general idea is that you will be able to 

It matters the type of people you meet with

**It matters the type of message the city sends you?**

Does it? I don't know. I think of kings day, New Year's Deewali

I don't know how to give any examples related to this, but rather a
general feeling but based on things I have seen on youtube? LA is all
about fucking! NYC all about the money the hedgefunds, thats who you
respect! and LA the startup and tech people.

The message that netherlands sends?

You don't need to get married. You need to have a hobbie. 

The message that chennai sends, work, eat shit (its ok), play some
badminton, it is ok to travel long hours, get married by 30, 

The general message the city sends to me is travel, earn less, work
less (I know many people who work only 4 daysx8hrs), pursue a hobbie. 

The message I got when I was in IIT, 

The message I get when I am at work is to be realllllllly good in what
I do. Be able to communicate well. 

But these are all claims. I think we need to start with the basics...


**The questions for the end**

Does it mean going to a hub you are going to meet these people? Aren't
there other people, say barbers, supermarket staff, say students
etc... Why will these people be the ones you hang out with the ones
you respect?

**Where all is persuasion**

In the things you watch, in the things you hear, in the things you do

**Using persuasion to your advantage**

2. Working in Bay Area with access to EA

3. Working in Silicon Valley with access to EA

4. Working with smart people in a top EAO like Open Phil within Sf
   area
   
   4>1>2>3
   
   Is what I think...


## Other shit maybe
## persuasion dump

So what I want from this is the following: Great that there are
ambitious people there. So what, how has being in a cluster affected
people in other communities, as a result of these ambitious people?
how has it affected being in EA community.

You can use dimensions like, value drift/value change even, work ethic
improvement, networking, opportunities, money, blindly copy others
actions

Examples I can use are: [EA](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/) McAskill going to y-combinator, 9
Australians out of 14 who moved to different EA places. How about some
examples in other cases: Florence, basketball, kings day (new years),
CAA in India, how I behave at work with wanting to get the respect of
others even though it might not be too relevant for me, why would I
work extra hours when they can't fire me. Why am I going to veldhoven
2 hrs++ during the week. 80khours claims moving to hubs
changed. gym. atleast phds hanging out with bachelors is unheard
of. you want to continue believing that working on this is important
dspite what others are doing, getting new girl friends, getting six
pack abs etc...

how I didn't do shit (value drift) when I went to India. working extra
caring about money, caring about what people think, what did you do
for in the weekend.

Finally I want to talk about dangers of being in a non-hub (with
examples). 

Anamolies: Do you need to stay in a "great region" to produce top
stuff. No, in math, in psycology people contribute from all over the
world. But for arts, and tech it looks like... 
	

### Attempt 1

<!--  You get the values of the people around you -->

> Florence is called the capital of arts; according to statistics
> produced by UNESCO, 60% of the world's most important works of art
> are located in Italy and approximately half of these are in
> Florence. From the 13th to the 16th century it was a seemingly

Despite Milan being in the same country as Italy and just as big,
Florence seems to have produced 30% of the most important art all over
the world. Somehow more and more was bred in Florence and not in
Milan. Something about Florence seems to have had it. Almost like if
you were in Florence there was a higher chance you would be producing
art. PG iterates it beautifully as usual.

>People in Florence weren't genetically different, so you have to
>assume there was someone born in Milan with as much natural ability
>as Leonardo. What happened to him?

Why is it like that? hmm. Why do ambitious people like to go to their
hubs? Maybe it gives them opportunities, networking possibilities,
like minded people, value drift reduction etc... etc... I don't
know. But there seems to be something.

1. Ambitious people somehow want to go there

2. It allows for reduction in value drift 

	Other things I want to address is how subtle, time dependent and
    frequency dependent it is. and finally maybe address going to an
    EA hub maybe in the next session.

3. It allows for increase in what is normal working hours

4. It allows to network

5. It provides more opportunities

6. More money

7. Across different fields the idea seems to be the same

Now the 7th one is the most interesting for me. That gives me more
confidence to pursue persuasion. 


Are there any examples from around the world? Yes until now I wrote
about different industries but I don't think I maintain the same
idea. But I do wanna show that this is across different
industries. But I guess I should still stick to dimension
based... Cuase money wise it seems almost eassy to point to all
differnt. One last time I want to think about different dimensions to
compare across. 

### Attempt 2

As seen in the previous section ambitious people for some reason think
it makes sense to make the move to the hubs. Like Tara MacAulay who
went from Australia all the way to being a chief at the Centre for
Effective Altruism.

**Great hubs offer more money usually**

Looking at Glassdoor estimates for first year salaries apple and fb worthy
people in Facebook and Apple, seems to be 180k and 190k
respectively. That is a lot. Contrast that to 

Average pay of a [data scientist in California is around
150k<span>$</span>](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/netherlands-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,11_IN178_KO12,26.htm). Average pay of a [data scientist in
Netherlands is 80k<span>$</span>](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/netherlands-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,11_IN178_KO12,26.htm).  And if you end up at places
like Facebook and Apple it is expected to go as high as 180k or 190k
when looked in Glassdoor just for the first year.

A friend of mine who was an Investment Bank Analyst, went from his job
in India to a job in New York. His salary in India I think was roughly
25k<span>$</span>. His salary in New York is in the ball park of
180k<span>$</span> (including bonus I think). The bank is JP Morgan & Chase

You are somehow making more money for the company at these hubs and
they seem to want to reward you. 

**Reduction in value drift**




**Dangers of being in a non-hub**

Recently when I was at work, I was way too determined to work on the
problems at work and make sure I came out successful in the eyes of my
teammates. It was important to me somehow what they thought of me. I
would pick up something hard and come out with flying colors, even if
it meant working late, going early, doing lesser working out, because
it was so important there was going to be a deadline. In addition all
these people went to Veldhoven often and that meant 2 hrs per day
extra work. Recently I started going to Veldhoven. I think I would
continue it even though everytime I go there the I loose 2 hours in
the day. They were all capable and I had to be seen like their
equal. Just being around them I wanted to be as good as them, even
though they couldn't fire me. Worst thing they would do is give me a
bad rating that would mean a percent decrease in my bonus (worst
case).

The problem is folks that this is not the most important thing for
me. I have some hard problems to crack and work on. And I need all my
resources to focus on that and get shit done. And I am choosing to
work on other things that are for sure less and less important by
valuing it more now than the things that I need to most work on.

Somehow I value something that is not really my thing more. 

Last month I went to India, in the hopes of working around 7 hrs a
day. I was going to be on vacation (very little distraction)
etc... etc... etc... or so I thought. What is disappointing is when I
had 8 hrs work day + sports in a week I still managed to do 10 hrs
atleast and going all the way till 20 hrs. But somehow during my trip
to India I did jack squat. Zilch. Like somehow there was everything
else that was more important (meeting old people, getting wasted as
often as I could), satisfying people by meeting them, and going
swimming. Like everything else had a higher prio or so it would
seem. The only difference I see is that here when I am in holland, I
have lesser distraction and as soon as I come home I eat and
procrastinate and then it is go time. I n the recent days life is much
better I am averaging 2.5 to 3 hrs per day. Need to go all the way
bro. Let's go.

Same thing with spending money to deal with New Year's and king's
day. Same thing with Learning about politics. etc...

**EA community**

I like something that Will MacAskill said here (tbd) in his post on
why he went into Y-combinator as a non-profit. 

> But at group office hours, Iâ€™d often feel like one of the least
> competent people in the room; and the organization I was helping run
> was doing merely fine by YC startup standards. This pushed me to
> work even harder and optimize my time even further.

That's the kind of thing we want. I am hoping this sort of attitude
pushes me to become great. 

There is an account of 14 people who went from Australia to each of
the hubs. 9 of them seemed to have either found contacts, or found
some new ways in which they can contribute (something they didn't think
of earlier), and are now working in SF or Oxford area in EA
organizations. (so much for networking, loosing value drrift etc...)



### Attempt 3 blue print

Florence

Will MacAskill's Work Ethic change

at Work I felt the same thing and I would do what ever it takes (even
if it is not my goal and even if I have to specnd extra time adn it is
not my agenda)

Its not that I am goign to everything they do, its just that I am
going to do what they respect. I need respect. I need to feel good
about myself. 

Same thing with Basketball. I need some respect, and the extent to
which I would go to get it is, I would practice 2 hrs in the weekend
