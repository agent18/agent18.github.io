Yes. Noted.

Sorry for being vague. I see it now. I meant the 'number of people who
are apply and are "good enough" to work at EA orgs. But perhaps "good
enough" is not good enough. So, 'the number of people who apply and had
PhD or >2yrs experience', or 'the number of people the orgs think are
employable', should suffice I think.

I don't get what you are saying. Here I group claims into sections and
every paragraph (roughly) has a claim followed by evidence or
example. Why is this not OK? What is exactly your worry?

Is the section title expected to be a proxy for all the claims in the
section?

I don't get it. Why does everything need to be testable in this
case? Why do you care about "ability to immediately asses and deploy
base is weak". OPP clearly says that they are having other problems
regarding hiring researchers (it doesn't seem to be "money" but
"ability to whatever"). So OPP is cited to inform that "meta-orgs"
don't seem to be "short on cash", to hire the next candidate. Can you
please clarify? Why isn't this enough as evidence? or what am I
missing?

I don't get your point. Why are we talking about hiring a million
people?

So we have the **claim**: Meta-orgs don't seem to be "affected by
funding" while hiring researchers. Let's say I wanted to test this
against **EE** and not with "OPP didn't want to hire in that round
because of ...". Then, I see the problem. I can't test it bro. Hell I
don't even know what it means. I am lost.

Let's try another,

**Claims**: Meta-orgs don't want to hire more researchers ~~not
because of funding issues~~ despite having enough funding.

Even this is not good. SS is hurting like hell "don't want to hire more
researchers", "despite having enough funding". 

**Claims**: Meta-orgs do not allocate more funding than previous year
to hire more researchers (than last year), despite allocating "more"
funds to other things like bigger office etc...

This seems to be testable by checking budget as an STM has
informed. Ufff! that took time to get to.

**Lessons**: Make claims testable by removing the fluff ("affected by
funding"). Go back to square one, subject predicate level to identify
the fluff. Agent is struggling with complicated claims ("affected by
funding"). As soon as you change that complicated part, you can modify
the claim to make it testable (as shown above).

Not testable with EE. Ok.

Yeah I fucking don't know how to test it with EE. +1.

Ok, I will change them to a new section. I guess that the claims in
sections are considered proxies for the section title.

Sounds great. I like the twist more now. Thank You.
