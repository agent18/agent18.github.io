Yes, it is the different relevant factors we have to explain a change
in output.

  Yes I guess, do I have one example though? Well think about
  understanding effect of subsistence on population density. If we
  look at Europe vs South America, Amidst several others, genetics,
  language, technology, resources and so on could also have an
  impact. AKA Large diff... Contrast that to Polynesian islands and
  you have controlled for genetics, language, technology atleast. AKA
  resulting in a small diff.

I didn't understand that part at all. Very hard to follow for
me. 

"However, the problem here is that it’s hard to be conclusive."
Why?

"First of all, if you have a lot of data, you may not be able to find
a model that predicts all of it accurately."

What data? what model? What happened to another way of narrowing down
the relevant factors?

I think maybe either sticking with the car pedal example or using
another fresh example *through out this para* to explain it might help.
  
> + Was the definition of "close negative example" clear?

Confusing in the beginning but when I read it again the second time of
reading the article, it was clear!

Except the first one on polynesia, every thing else was easy to
follow.

"He could then analyze the effect of a factor such as food
collection (“subsistence”) on an output variable like population
density:"

In the beginning you wanted to explore "culture" vs "productivity". It
might be nicer to write it as subsistence vs population density, not
ambiguous at all.

"He could analyze the effect of, say, geological type and marine
resources on the type of food collection (nonintensive, slash-and-burn
agriculture vs irrigation agriculture):"

Why do we have to connect environmental factors to subsistence to
population densities? I was puzzled seeing this as I expected you to
directly talk about the matter at hand "culture vs productivity". If
we do have to talk about them (environmental factors vs subsistance),
then its too much reading effort. The proof is too long with many
quotes in between. I am just starting out with the idea, so I would
rather you keep it simple atleast in the first few examples. Less
text, less tangents or detours (albeit it being necessary for the
proof).

**House example**: Would be nice if you could finish the example with
the results, albeit fictional. 

"The same goes for the different food sources in different
hospitals. "

Ok this like threw me off. The large diff seems too large by
accounting for all the babies in different hospitals even. 

The conclusion however was very clear. Had to think for a few seconds
how to narrow the diff. Must keep the example! Very interesting.x

**Soccer Star**: You have certainly reduced the diff by a lot. Good
one. But is this enough to predict something! Maybe an example?

"So, look at a change in his skill that occurred over a short period
of time. Only so many things can change in a few weeks."

How about an example here?

"Find out the factors that caused those increments and you’ll know the
relevant factors and their precise impact"

Regarding finding out the relevant factors, I think you recently wrote
an article about it. There could still be a couple of factors and some
impact. How are you going to identify the precise impact of the
relevant factors? Can you give an example in this context?

What do you mean precise impact? How do you go from 3 relevant factors
(small diff) to Precise impact?

**Economic policies**

How about an example, showing the idea in action.

**Math Example**: Even though I couldn't actually see what the math
problem was about, I think it is still an instructive example and that
you have done justice in the explanation.

> + Were there too many examples?

There are never TOO many examples! I personally need all of
these. Maybe I would be happy to skip the first example with
polynesia. Was a bit confusing. I've read it a few times already. 

> + Did you learn something new? What applications could you see for this?

Yes I learn't something new. I think I learn't "a way to solve real
life problems". Definitely controlling for genetics by
measuring the same exact person never occurred to me. I constantly see
some people in the gym who are slightly more built than me and can
lift 30kg dumbbells. If I really want to know how they are lifting
"more" aka 30kg dumbell, I need to look at them, and them 5 months back
or 2 months back and maybe already look at factors like sleep, food,
and training method. Or maybe probably just training method as they
might be eating and sleeping roughly the same (unless there are
exams). Did I just reduce the diff? PNN!

Scooby often gives advice on his sweatforhealth channel. I often kept
thinking why would his advice work for me? Don't we always hear
"everybody is different, what works for you might not work for
him". Fuck I think I internalized this shit. Kill me. Assuming scooby
tried out ABC XYZ and RTY workouts ("keeping everything else the
same") and measured their progress and concluded that RTY gave maximum
output, then taking his advice seems to make sense as he has
controlled for genetics in his experiment. Scooby is essentially
saying, for a baseline of genetics XYZ seems to work best for muscle
gain. So Scooby can actually give advice to everybody based on his
experiments and maybe we'll be foolish not to take his advice. Maybe
we'll be foolish to say "everybody is different, everyone develops
muscle in different way. What works for one, might not work for
another" and just rot in hell. Other places I would like to look into:

Happiness vs having-girlfriend-status (RF)

Happiness vs marriage status (RF)

Happiness vs "pursuing a meaningful life" status (RF)

Halitosis vs RF's etc... could be some RF's and output variables I
could look into to narrow the diffs and see how far I get with
identifying the true reasons for something working.

I don't get "matter for given baseline of genes". I don't get the
point you are trying to make with that example.
