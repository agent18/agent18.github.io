## GOAL:

To identify/estimate the career direction I need to take in the coming
months focusing on impact.
                               
### Achieving the Goals

Based on [the 80k-hours guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/) a way forward in determining the way
forward would be to answer the following questions.

<!-- Making a list of options -->

**Making a list of options** by using these questions:

What do you want to do in life? Provide exact examples of profiles
that you would like to be like? What are the different career paths
you think are available to you? Give one way how you would achieve
it?

<!-- Rankingish your options --> 

**Comparing different options** based on Skills, Connections,
Credentials, Runway, & Personal fit, job satisfaction, Impact

<!-- Write out key uncertainities -->

**Write out your key uncertainities:** What are the things that you
are uncertain about? Can you quickly test
them? Are they going to change your ranking largely?

## Making a list of options


### What can I do to create large impact? (broadly)

One can either earn-to-give (ETG), or do direct work, and if highly unsure
about the future improve their skills and build career capital with the
goal being to maximize saving lives. Earning-to-give needs no
explanation. An example of direct work (DW) would be to work for an
NGO that stages interventions to help the poor get back upon their
feet. Working in Management consulting (MC) would be a way to keep
building flexible Career Capital (FCC) which will allow later to take
up different types of jobs in different industries.

In addition to these one can also perform advocacy - the promotion of
solutions to pressing problems. For example, in addition to or instead
of earning yourself, you could inspire/persuade a friend to pursue ETG
as well. I don't plan to discuss advocacy right now in detail. I hope
to take it up on another post at another time as I don't see it having
much consequence for me at this time. Of course we should do
everything we can to get others to also pursue Effective Altruism (EA).

The 80k-hours guide features several career-reviews that they
recommend us to pursue and profiles of people who they consider to be
high impact causers. From this we can derive what is possible within
this world, what have other high impact causers done, and what are
some possible careers that might make sense for us. This would allow
for further fine-tuning later in the essay.

A small side note: This essay heavily relies on the 80k-hours guide. I
have dealt with why we should use the work of 80k hours in the
appendix.

<!-- todo why 80k hours is the shizz -->

#### Earning-to-give 

A career in ETG might include one of the following:

- **An investment banker** who will earn in millions and give away >50% of
his salary.

- A **Management Consultant** who will earn > 250k$ and
  give away >30%
  
- A **Data scientist/Project Management** who will earn 200k$ (in 5-10
  years) and give as much as possible
  
- A **Programmer** who will earn 200k$ (in a few years) and give as much as
  possible

- Taking up **Entrepreneurship** although with very small chance of
  success, has the potential to cause major influence with earning,
  advocacy and direct work.
  
[Ben West](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/ben-west/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentwest/)) an entrepreneur (with the guidance in
career from 80k-hours) is expected to donate millions to charity. He
is going to keep a minimum wage for himself and donate the rest of his
salary.

Ben West is a fantastic and inspiring example of someone who is going
to ETG. There is a lot of luck involved in such a career, but
nevertheless, it is the attitude that is at praise here - A person who
can earn millions saying he will keep minimum wage.

<!-- Amazing, he can even say things like this! -->

#### Direct working

>80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should
>earn to give long term. We think that most people should be doing
>things like politics, policy, high-value research, for-profit and
>non-profit entrepreneurship, and direct work for highly socially
>valuable organizations.

1. Found &/or Lead or manage Effective Altruism organizations to be
  most impactful. Some inspiring profiles covered by 80k-hours in this
  area of direct work, below:
  
[Tara Macaulay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarajmacaulay/)), was (then) head of operations (now
CEO) in the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA). Tara has always been
outstanding at her work, be it with saving money for her company or
rising the ranks very fast. She has apparently left a lasting impact
in Bhutan where she worked on direct impact projects.*She interned
without pay at CEA* showing great leadership skills and then rose the
ranks to become the current CEO. She has no MBA degrees and infact
only has a pharma degree but that hasn't stopped her. The CEA gets a
lot of funding (in millions) which it directs to worthy applicants
that can create large impact.

[Rob Mather](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-mather-b0331235/)), is the CEO of Against Malaria
foundation (AMF) - critically acclaimed as one of the most effective
organizations by GiveWell. He has had top education, and possibly an
all-the-time high achiever who went to Harvard Business School and
University of Cambridge. The AMF saves millions of lives a year.

[David Goldberg](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/david-goldberg/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjonathangoldberg/)), co-founder of Founders Pledge,
that makes Tech entrepreneurs legally bounded to donate in case their
startups succeed. He is definitely another all-the-time high achiever,
who went to Cambridge, but has a degree in philosophy. He has done
everything other than continuing with philosophy.

>Before all that, I spent a couple years in finance in the US, started
>and sold a business in Europe, and ran a chain of Segway dealerships
>in California. All in, a pretty bizarre career trajectory if I’m
>honest, which was largely the result of having no clear idea of what
>I wanted to do with my life until recently.

But now he has focused all of his might into the Founders Pledge to
create high impact.

  <!-- Seems to be a scope to intern at these places (seems to be -->
  <!--       working based on availability) -->

We saw a few different profiles, each of them doing amazing things in
a joint effort to save as many lives as possible

2. Be an Analyst/researcher at Effective Altruism Organizations (EAOs)
   such as GiveWell or 80k-hours

In organizations like GiveWell, 80k-hours, CEA etc... they need people
to write useful content in an understandable way and they need people
to research what programs are effective and most impactful. In other
words, solving problems with limited data, knowing what type of data
is interesting, and presenting it in clear manner, is done by analysts
or researchers. Here the main criteria are strong critical thinking
skills, statistics and Mathematics.

Most of the EAO's have very few people (10-30), funneling or creating
impact in the order of millions of dollars. As an analyst you could
already [make an impact of 97k$ a year](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/).

3. Working in Policy

This involves, shaping the policy of governments to impact a population of a city,
state, country or world. 

For example, an Economics PhD working with the government, will
[sometimes have the chance to impact a large population](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) by
influencing policy based on logic and numbers. Although these chances
are rare an Econ Phd is still considered one of the best PhD's to
pursue (I guess owing to the impact).

[Niel Bowerman ](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/niel-bowerman/) ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielbowerman/)), previously the Assistant Director
of Future of Humanity Institute, studied at Oxford University,
is another outstanding talent featured in the 80k-hours website. He
does not have an MBA, he is a physics major, previously handling
fundraising, operations management etc... And now he is the head of AI
policy for 80k-hours. With this he is able to guide potential
candidates in the right direction to assist in mitigating the [risks
of AI](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/).

**Lessons learnt:**

- According to 80k-hours DW must be pursued by most of the people as
EAO's are usually not talent constrained

- *Most of the featured profiles in the 80k-hours website do not have
an MBA*. Everyone has shown definite signs of greatness from the
beginning and looking at their profile, they are headed for more
greatness.

- Being in EAOs seems to allow to achieve a large impact (quantified later)
  
#### Building career capital

Although ultimately we might be ETG or doing DW, when we are young it
is advised to focus on gaining flexible career capital to allow us
flexibility in the job market and to be useful in different domains as
needed by the then important focus area.

[Dillon Bowen](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/dillon-bowen/)([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dillon-bowen-409791a1/)) is working
towards his Economics PhD based on the counseling he got from
80k. Economics PhD is highly recommended graduate program by
80k-hours guide, due to the high impact in direct working.

<!-- But I don't really think I have the age or the talent for an Economics -->
<!-- PhD. -->

 <!-- TBW, He has no MBA, as a result. -->

[Peter Huford](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/peter-hurford/)([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhurford8/)), taught himself how to program from
political science background that now, he is improving his skills in
business, programming and finance and also having extra time to work
on other charity projects. Peter seems to be a great example of one
who is building great FCC.


  <!-- * [ ] Appears that I should follow something like this, and talk to -->
  <!--       Herman maybe, as the spending time on an MBA to do some IB is -->
  <!--       not really seeming to be required. A better understanding or -->
  <!--       working or creation of new things can increase the outcome 10 -->
  <!--       fold in no time. I think I should just focus on things like -->
  <!--       this and get better and become really skillful. -->


#### summary

In summary I would like a profile as above which would allow me to
create the maximum impact I can. I would like to leave such a legacy
behind (like that of TARA). It is important for me to dream big and
currently the profiles of these people seem already hard enough to set
as my goal.

The importance of direct work has been stressed a lot by 80k-hours. In
the long run that is what I guess I should be doing. But for the next
few years, no harm in making money as well as building career
capital. But money is not the objective, getting yourself in shape to
do good is. Gaining skills to make crazy impact is.

In the following section we make a list of options and evaluate them
to see what we should be doing to make the largest impact we can.

### Making the list

Making a list according to 80k-hours sounds far-too-specific like
"economics researcher focusing on global health", "marketing for meat
substitutes" etc...

I am afraid I am right now only trying to figure out what could be the
direction I would be expected to go in, i.e., **the next few years &
early career choices** in an attempt of collecting career capital in
the direction of where I want to be. I assume I cannot be certain in
determining exactly what I am going to be doing @ 45. But as pointed
out earlier, you can see what I would like to grow towards.

Furthermore if I miss something, I would like to put the onus on my
reviewers, aka the 80k community, an STM and the decision tool to help
me out.

#### My rough list!

Roughly I imagine the list to be:

1) Continuing in the same job or being a design engineer and rising
the ranks as so.

- Far too specific information learning at the moment (suspect it is useless)

As echoed previously to myself and in my archive, it appears that I am
learning something too specific, like how to make drawings and how to
design in tight tolerances, these are far too specific

- I do a bit of trouble shooting and critical thinking, I would like
  to do more.

- I do not want to work on puzzling out more about volumes and
interferences manually, say using (god-forbid) powerpoint. for
example, things I could do with a better tool. Of course I could have
a better way of work. Well let there be better problems to solve.

2) An MBA to management consulting or IB or trading(very high job
satisfaction according to 80k-hours) for now, hoping to get some
experience and a lot of money, to propel career ahead.

Right now it appears that the an MBA can open avenues into consulting,
IB and Trading. These seem to allow to get good experience and a lot
of money. Job satisfaction and long hours might suffer for a few.

Other than doing an MBA there dont seem many options. And I have
echoed my sentiment to a couple of MBA graduates who seem to agree
([IB at JP Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ram-narayan-86b7b199/)),([Marketeer from Newyork who has scholarships in
MBA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rawanalhaffar/)), Another friend who is an Analyst in California going into
product management.

But right now I do not need to make the choice of what I will be
taking. I can leave that decision for sometime in the future.

3) Data science (research, critical thinking?), moving on to
programming or not

I sort of club DS and programming together. As I see DS my first
direction to go into even if programming is what I might do in the
end. DS already involves some programming and I can get a job I think
quickly (3 months) in Netherlands and from there get better at it and
programming and see where it takes me. Although, DS would be much more
oriented towards critical thinking I guess.

4) Starting up

No idea where to start, no ideas of what to start, lack of skill and
confidence. A tech start-up sounds interesting, maybe I could find
some work there. I could go over to some meeting in rotterdam and see
what the scene is like. 

I think we should expect a long lead time with tech startups,
especially ones that involve making a phisical product of any
nature. 

Although I am currently working in a startup I see that I don't have
any "startup benifits"

5) Joining an NGO, starting as an Intern

6) Data-science or Programming in Finance (best of two worlds)
	
#### Career Quiz: recommended list of careers

The career quiz with the selected options result in the following
career choices: 

1) Could you become good at math, science or logic?
Yes (outperform 80% of graduates)

2) Could you become good at writing and speaking? 
Yes (Outperforming 80% of graduates in a humanities subject)

3) Are you happy betting on a small chance of a big impact?
No

4) Are you happy trying to work in the most demanding fields?
Yes

Challenging and long hours should not be a problem I suppose. I have
seen evidences of this in my past, with my master thesis(10-14 hrs a
day, programming, reading), with my work in IIT Madras (easily clocked
10 hrs or more a day for 1 year atleast), Courses in my masters
etc... and for a while I would work 8 hrs a day and come back home and
spend 2 hrs a day writing and researching etc... 

5) How far through your career are you?

Early (27) finished masters and working for ~2 years

6) How do you want to contribute? 

All possible ways: Direct, indirect, earning to give, research etc...

And the out put is:

- Policy oriented Civil services
- Economics PhD
- Data Science (skill building and earning to give)
- Working at effective non-profites
- Machine learning PhD
- Software engineering (skill building and earning to give)
- Trading in quantitative hedge funds

When we are ready to bet on small chances then:

- Congressional staffer
- Policy oriented Civil services
- Machine learning PhD
- Working at effective Altruist organizations
- Founding effective non-profits
- Data science
- Party politics


#### My next steps

The focus for this article should be that I develop through this post
what I should do next, like in the next 6 months. Where should I begin
and what should I do.

I am broadly looking at few things based on the rough list I have and
the Career Quiz

1. Sticking to design engineering

	- Working in the US?
	- Staying in DE
	- Attempting to startup
	- Going into the NGO management after a few years in this field.
	
2. Moving to DataScience
   
   - DS
   - Programming
   - Machine learning PhD
   - Working at GiveWell type of NGO's
   
3. Doing an MBA

	- IB
	- NGO as analyst or management
	- Management Consulting
	- Marketting Sales
	- trading in quantitative hedge funds
	
	
4. Civil services

	Dont know where or how to start, other than in India, but I am not
    sure of the evaluating the kind of impact I can have in India
	
5. Think Tanks

6. Working at Effective Altruism organizations


#### Comparing

The plan is to write about these:

Compare them based on Career Capital:  Skills, Connections, Credentials, Runway,
&
Personal fit, job satisfaction, Supportive conditions, Impact

And to all the career options I have until now.

Following this, I would like to also use the decision making chart and
the decision tool of the 80k-hours website to do the same. 



**Career Capital**

Skills:

>Skills – what will you learn in this job, and how fast will you
>learn? You can break skills down into transferable skills, knowledge
>and personality traits. Some especially useful transferable skills
>include: personal productivity, analysis and problem-solving, the
>ability to learn quickly, decision-making, social skills, and
>management. We cover why and how to learn them in a later article. If
>you want to do good, you also need to learn all about the world’s
>most pressing problems and how to solve them. A job will be best for
>learning when you are pushed to improve and get lots of feedback from
>mentors.

- Transferable skills
  - personal productivity
  - Critical thinking, analysis and problem solving
  - ability to learn quickly
  - decision-making
  - social skills
  - management
- Knowledge

- Personality traits
  - Confidence



Connections:

>Connections – who will you work with and meet in this job? Your
>connections are how you’ll find opportunities, spread ideas and start
>new projects. The people you spend time with also shape your
>character. For both reasons, it’s important to make connections who
>are influential and who care about social impact.

Are my connections going to get me jobs in different industries or
other industries?

Are my connections going to inspire me to do good?

Are my connections influential?

Credentials:

> will this job act as a good signal to future collaborators or
> employers? Note that we don’t just mean formal credentials like
> having a law degree, but also your achievements and reputation. If
> you’re a writer, it’s the quality of your blog. If you’re a coder,
> it’s your GitHub.

Runway:

>how much money will you save in this job? Your runway is how long you
>could comfortably live with no income. It depends on both your
>savings and how much you could reduce your expenses by. We recommend
>aiming for at least six months of runway to maintain your financial
>security. 12-18 months of runway is even more useful because it gives
>you the flexibility to make a major career change. It’s usually worth
>paying down high-interest debt before donating more than 1% per year
>or taking a big pay cut for greater impact.

Ability to quickly save enough money for 18 months is what seems to be
defining runway. How much I can donate is a question answerd by the
impact section.

Runway seems to be always important.

**Supportive conditions**

- Engaging work
- Colleagues
- Basic needs
- fit with rest of life

> Impact and personal life
> Engaging work - Will you get freedom to decide how to work, clear tasks, clear feedback and variety in what you do?
> Colleagues- Will you like them and will they support you?
> basic needs- Will you earn enough money, will the hours be manageable, and will the commute be reasonable?
> Fit with rest of your life -– Will you be able to improve your
> personal relationships, and uphold any other important personal
> priorities?

[Source: how to compare different careers ](https://80000hours.org/articles/framework/#questions-for-assessing-each-factor) 

**Personal Fit**

What are your chances of excelling in that area?

**In summary,**

 $ (f1xCareer Capital +f2xImpact +f3supportive conditions) *
 Personalfit
 
>If you are still early in your career, then it’s best to place
>greater importance on career capital than on role impact

>The more uncertain you are about the long-run, the more you should
>prioritise flexible career capital over

>The more altruistically-minded you are, the less weight you’ll need
>to place on job satisfaction relative to the other factors.

There by I see f1 = 1, f2 = 0.7, and f3 = 0.5.

80k suggests role-impact and not impact. This would mean that I
somehow have an idea of what problem I have chosen to focus
on. On a high level, it is all about saving lives, adding good years
to lives around the world now and later. 

To simplify the solving of the above problem, I suggest we just stick
to impact as being saving lives. I will try to make estimations of
saving lives with this.

#### Design engineering (Machine Design) in 'Europe' for Direct work

**Skills**: 

- Skills are too specific

Right now I am learning a very specific amount of skills. Skills like
making proper drawings, Skills on how to design for the precision
industry, What type of motors work where, how to keep things simple
etc... Great for the precision engineering market but I dont think it
preps me for the Leadership or research type of jobs that I plan in
the future. 

- Not very challenging all the time, not pushed to do more or given a
lot of feedback

A last word is that as an engineer I have to do a lot of unnecessary
things, kind a like doing experiments manually. In other words wasting
time (Not doing anything creative or useful in the long run). Time is
really precious and you would want every single minute to count. I see
myself 'wasting' a lot of time here. 

Last is I work for <40 hrs a week and I am barely at any pressure or
pushed to achieve great things,

- gaining management skills takes a long while before it happens

Even if I become a design leader (as they call it here), it would take
say 8 years atleast (35), where I go into a tech leadership kind of
role, where I am managing a technical team, knowing on a high level
what my team is doing. 

- Small percentage of critical thinking

A part of my work is also critical thinking but it is definitely a
small part (20-30%), but it is a small part. 

- Not very valuable even with many many years of experience

As far as I have seen and the fact that even glassdoor says this, more
experience is not really valued a lot beyond 1-2 decades. My
colleague ears 52k with 30 years of expereince and I earn 40k. If I
switch companies already I can make as much as him.

So, the dearth of transferable skills, the minimum quantity of
critical thinking, a decent amount of creativity building. Going to
another company, can't imagine life being very different. 

So,
Overall I give it like an average rating of 5.


**Connections**:


I will work with other design engineers and physicists in the job. I
might be able to find opportunities in related fields. But I don't
think this would be useful, considering that this is probably not the
industry I should continue in. 

My connections might be useful in finding jobs in the same industry
but otherwise, I would assume that they will be useless almost. 

This is live below average of 3. 


**Credentials**:

Typical credentials include, sudden promotions, rewards for delivery
on time, or that I designed something that had very positive end
results.

Except for the last thing informing that I am a good designer
(specific for this job), I am will not be able to boast any reasonable
achievements that can look good on my application to GiveWell or other
cool NGO's or even startups.

It seems like a normal 9-5 job with some performance indicators of me
learning quickly but that is it I think.

For a writer it is his blog, for a coder it is his Github, for a
mechanical deisgner, it is his portfolio of work done till now, which
would of course be useful to take up other jobs in the same precision
industry. 

So I rate this as average at best average (5).

**Runway**:

In Netherlands I can save about 10k euros per year. Removing my
donation, and all other extra expenses that seem to be coming, I think
I can save about 6k per year. I can improve this by 4k.

Runway gathering takes a slow 3 years. 6.

**Personal Fit**:

To excel in this area would mean to somehow gain skills or sanity to
either found an NGO, or work in one in operations or research.

- chances of learning skills at the age of 33 within design
  engineering (85%)
- possibility of learning the right skills within this industry (60%)
- Getting a job after in either research or management in top NGO's
  based on research or operations related credentials (70%)
  
  I don't expect it to be as tough as getting a job in MC. Plus I have
  quite some spare time on my hand. I could always look to improve my
  knowledge and skills. I would have 40 days of vacation every year,
  which I could really use to become better or even take internships.

So a total 35%.

**Impact**:

I made some calculations on the number of lives saved if one works for
top NGO's like GiveWell or 80k-hours. It comes to about 600-3000 lives
(shown in appendix). Another estimate by a person who worked there,
relates to 1500 lives (extrapolated to 40 years). We use this number
as it is made by a givewell employee.  As we will be spending the next
10 years prepping for it in essence, we would have 970 lives of impact
in case we still pursued Direct work at top organizations despite
being after 10 years of our life.

As mentioned in the appendix, pitfalls of this '970 lives' number, is
that it is based on the contribution of a person offering 10% impact
as that of the co-founder. Another thing is that the whole [Indirect
effects](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) is not taken into account at all. So in essence we would
be saving many more than 970 lives. 


**Supporting conditions**

Work is engaging, I can always find challenges. Work outside of DE
towards the Direct Work can also be quite engaging. Basic needs are
met, It will fit with the rest of the life, Colleagues are all fine
and ready to help when you ask for help. 

It has hard to find like minded people here who share any interest in
Altruism. Of all the people I have met, I do not know a single soul
who does anything close to 10% of donation. They are too busy
chilling, going to the beach, working and planning on pleasurable
activities after activities. 

<!-- Not that I am any great soul or something; Well ;)-->

**Summary**

With the intention of doing Direct Work, it still seems
alright. Rather I don't think it gives me any special skills but it
gives me time (22hrs a week on avg), a citizenship, sabbatical leave
with which I can slowly and meticulously plot my way out of DE to
Direct work.

<!-- This para does not belong here but in the NGO section -->

I estimated the lives saved between 600 to 3000 and the[ Analyst at
GiveWell](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) estimates lives saved at 1500 (extrapolated over 40
years). This is based on 3% compounding interest of the expected
contribution in the first year. Climbing the ladder might contribute
much larger impact as for now the considered impact is only based on
10% of co-founders contribution. Also there is a lot of indirect
impact due to the organizations which goes unaccounted for. Working in
NGO's like 80k should save > 1500 people I guess. Which is a decently
large number. Turns out to be 5 times larger than estimates by just
doing DE for earning-to-give.

	
#### Design engineering (Machine Design) in 'Europe' for Earning to give

With this section we attempt to deal with 3 types of ways of earning
to give. One with being an all-the-time DE in NL, doing DE for now,
but then moving on to Sales and the other moving to the US and
sticking to DE and/or sales.

DE in Europe is a low paying job as compared to the US
options. Depending on the size of the company your pay varies. 

<!-- going to the US with DE might be possible but I suspec only with -->
<!-- L1 I will make a separate post out of it -->

With the following I try to see how many lives I can save with such an
earning, what is the extent of flexible CC being here in Europe and in
PE (precision engineering).

**Skills**:

- Not very challenging all the time, not pushed to do more and given
  only a decent amount of feedback.

I work for <40 hrs a week and I am barely at any pressure or
pushed to achieve great things,

- gaining management skills takes a long while before it happens

As mentioned before, it would take 7-8 years before I move into a
Design Leader position.

- Small percentage of critical thinking

As said earlier 20-30% is probably critical thinking.

- Not very valuable even with many many years of experience

As said before.

- Decent transferable skills

I will have quite some knowledge of the Semicon industry, maybe a good
chance to port to Sales, So I think it does offer some sort of FCC
(flexible Career capital) to offer. Even within my company they were
looking for people in the management side who would have more than 5
years of Semicon experience. Plus I have seen the useless nutheads in
sales who do not understand the product and have no idea what it can
do and still pitch it to others, I think I would be a welcome relief
to such an industry needing solid engineers who can also talk.

Although I am not sure of why going into automotive or space might be
interesting, moving to other such industries might be hard or
impossible. I have seen people move from other industries to
precision, but not the other way around. I suspect going the other way
might need a lot of pre-knowledge and your knowledge might just not be
fully portable. So I can stay in PE for ever, not a problem, there
should be enough scope for me to do so I guess. Atleast I don't see
why not.

With my free time I can prep in DS but I don't expect to become really
good at it as I am working only part time. I have 2 months of vacation
and all this can be used for additional good.

- All companies in Netherlands, Germany, Europe have this lifestyle in
general.

A decent amount of transferable skills, the minimum quantity
of critical thinking, a decent amount of creativity while working.

So, 
- Transferable skills : 6.5

**Connections**:

I will work with other design engineers and physicists in the job. I
might be able to find opportunities in related fields.

Connections might be useful in finding jobs outside. Do not have any
out of the world connections that will actually help. 

This sounds like it is at 4, slightly better than last section.

**Credentials**:

I see myself growing up the ladder very very slowly (4-5 years per
promotion). It is a slow working environment (mainly because of
research). Right now maybe I can boast to other precision companies
regarding what I could do for them.

The first two years leave me with very little credentials worthy for
the Semicon market as there were some cancellations of projects, but I
am hopeful about the next few months. But still I am quite positive I
can find my way in the Semicon industry to the World Leader ASML's
house even now. 

Credentials wise, as I am in the Semicon and expect to move into
Semicon or other PE related work, I suspect I should survive and be
able to quote something decent.

Credential level assignments need to be given and take time and other
company priorities come in the way of my success.

I would put it at an above average value of 6.

**Runway**:

Same as quoted in the previous section. Runway of 18k would take
realistically 3 years and there is scope for improvement if I move to
another company but still remains average of 6.

Runway in case I move into sales will be different, but right now I
would have to clock my years in PE before I make the ultimate
decision.

Even if I have to move to the US I still need to be in NL for a few
years before I plot the jump.

<!-- Ways of moving to the US and prolty estimates unknown, but runway -->
<!-- could be crazy, but I still suspect I need to clock a few good -->
<!-- years here before I am able to migrate reasonably-->

**Personal Fit**:

To excel in this area would mean 

- being a typical engineer for the rest of my life and grow through
  the ranks slowly and probably consulting after a period of time.  
  I estimate this at 95% chance of success for me. This is like the
  minimum I should be able to achieve at any cost. (95%)
  
- Somehow see opportunity into sales and move into it after a few
years in the PE industry.
But is sales a good fit for me? I don't know, I have seen random
people move into sales and succeed. My cousin was an ordinary
Mechanical Engineer who rose the ranks in sales and got crazy
cuts. Another cousin moved from electrical engineering (brainy guy
though) and managed a killer career.

I will atleast try a brief stint if I am stuck to DE. I can always
fall back to DE as and when I like. The way I would do it is join ASML
(the leading lithographers) and from there see where it takes me. 

So I expect the chance to be slightly more than landing an elite MC
job. (65%)

- Moving to the US

  There are a couple of ways I go to the US, either by direct applying
  or by migrating from one country to the other via an L1 visa.  <!--
  Also possibly go to Canada and follow the L1 route -->
  
  In 5 years time I would suspect to have worthy experience with which
  I can try for a switch to the US. By then I would have an NL
  Citizenship and I can reduce the risk of crashing an burning in
  life.
  
  - Chance of becoming really good in DE (80%)
  - Chance of managing an L1 or getting selected directly (60%)
  
  DE in PE is quite niche I think, so I suspect it to be easier to get
  into the US than say DS for example.
  
  So in total: 80%\*60% = 48% of success.

**Impact**:

The impact of being a typical engineer for the next 40 years is
estimated to be ~200 lives.

The impact of moving into sales can probably significantly switch
things up, but I estimate it at 2 times the impact of full time DE. If
I can donate 20% and also make an extra 20% in sales then that will
result twice the impact. Yes I am pulling these numbers almost out of
my ass, as I don't have good estimates of it. I will refine this
number later if needed.


The impact of moving to the US could be much better as the pay is
reasonably higher.

  - With compound interest of 4% a year
  - inflation of 2% a year
  - increase of 10% every 5 years
  - and 20% donation
  - for a beginners salary of 100k
  
315 lives in the US for 35 years + 13 lives for the first 5 years in
NL = 330 lives.
		
#### Data science for direct giving

With this section I am going to try to write about DS for direct
giving

**Skills**

Statistics, critical thinking, programming and machine learning could
be the knowledge and skills I would transfer to research based jobs,
and not necessarily leadership based jobs. However I suspect that a
role in project management after a few years could get me somewhere
like an all-rounder in the field of DS.

- High Flexible Career Capital

Also DS is only the starting point. Once I start DS, programming,
using different languages all will be things I will be working on,
which allows for a machine learning PhD maybe. DS looks like a good
place to start skills wise.

>The technical skills you develop also open the possibility to
>transition into different roles including software engineering,
>founding or joining early-stage startups, academia, and quant
>finance. - [80k-DS](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/) 

With very good skill I could move to NGO's (Direct impact potential)
as well. 

- Still time available for doing more as DS is not really taxing even
  in the US ([reasonable and flexible hours](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/))
  
- Possibility of gaining management skills being in project management

More Flexible Career Capital

- More Critical thinking than DE

I will be working at a company and also simultaneously earning skills
in Stats quants etc...

- More valuable with more experience.

- A good portion of time is spent of cleaning up the data
  unfortunately.
  
- Companies like KLM even have jobs for engineers and data
scientists. This could be quite lucrative for me and for the company,
as I span both the spectra.

Skills for Direct impact: 8

I can earn skills even while at work which means I am wasting little
time doing other things.

Skills for DS in earning to give in Europe or US: 8

Skills wise knowledge wise, it would be very good for continuing
within DS be it either in NL or US.


**Connections**

Connections depends on where I am working and which type of company I
will be working for. For example working in a consultancy which helps
out companies in this world, then there is a great chance to meet many
people and build the network. The network as a result would be better
than in DE. Moving to the US might even be more beneficial.

Connections that further NGO opportunities: 4.5

Connections that further DS in NL for earning to give: 5.5

Connections that further DS in US for earning to give: 5.5

**Credentials**

DS has a fast paced scene as I get from 80k. Faster feedback cycle,
and large connection between work and outcomes can be felt. Further
impression I get is that you can brag about your outcomes, rather they
will be braggable to a future employer. Seeing my friend in DS and
what all he has bragged about being in Musigma in his first 2 years
sound amazing.

I suspect with this career, that would be one advantage, i.e., to be
able to brag with credentials. For example, X was low and I suggested
Y and then X soured. 

My belief that DS will give good credentials combined with an
uncertainity is I guess 7.5.

**Runway** 

DS in NL probably starts with a slightly higher salary than DE based
on estimates from Payscale  DS's seem to earn ([46k](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/05582c7c/Amsterdam) and design
engineers [40k](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Design_Engineer/Salary)). This implies a faster runway than DE. 

DS in US allows a more faster collection of the runway for 18 months.

But in any case right now it appears I will have to work in NL and
slowly plot my travel towards US or NGO's. 

In general DS can produce a higher runway.

There is no reason to look at jobs in US as getting them now would be
hard and already feels unrealistic for now.

So I will give it 7 as compared to the 6 for DE.

**Personal fit**

Anyone can come into data science, we are not talking about data core
or machine learning. The skills are basically stats, programming in
python, R and SQL.

I think the personal fit is also good here. I am up for challenging
jobs all the time. I love programming and can spend like any other
sane human being a very large time working on it. 

I think I can very well learn and get better at these skills over some
time. I could quickly do bootcamps from home and become good at DS. I
am a fast learner and have worked on proper programming assignments
before. I have done a fair bit of critical thinking, hypothesis
forming and solving problems at work and my masters. I love it to
begin with and I think there is a lot of room to get better and I can
get better at it, with more defined ways of thinking.

So I think I have some experience with it. I can already work with
python and I am young just 27. I see this as a great fit for me. I
feel that I should be able to achieve great forms of success within DS
if I stick to it over my entire career. 

I have solved problems at my work, I enjoy doing them.

<!-- Comment on what motivates an induvidual  to something link? -->

- DS as a means of earning to give (Netherlands)
  
  Here success would mean moving to a job in DS in NL from DE. This is
  to be followed by 40 years of work, with 20% of donations every
  year.
  
    
  I know a few of my colleagues who are in DS right out of a similar
  masters degree as I. Plus from everything I have seen it is a
  learn-able skill, and appears to be definitely learn-able.
  
  I think I can probably do more but I will stick to the above
  definition of success and I think that there is a 93% chance of
  success.  
  
- DS as a means of earning to give (US)

  I am yet to estimate in numbers my chance of going to the US
  somehow, I will finish this essay and then come back if it is still
  relevant. For now I am going to assume a 70% chance of going to the
  US. Seems high, but I think with killer skill, I should be able to
  get jobs in europe within Google or Facebook and slowly plot my
  migration. I could also do a one year masters for example. Of course
  the assumption is that I will kill at the skill within the next few
  years.
  
  Chance of killing it (80%), I am going to give it my all. All this
  cause EA is everything EA is all?
  
  Chance of getting L1 within company? No idea (50%)?
  
  So in total: 93%\*80%\*50% = 37.2% of success.
  
  <!-- I think I need to write a prolty caleculation for
  moving to the US --> 

- DS in NGO's

Here, we could be talking. With good stats and quants capability, I
think we might have a good future here to do good.

There are NGO's which use DS to do good. Due to the skills I learn in
DS, I think I will be worthy as an analyst/DS at NGOs. If I spend
enough time, I could already manage a team and gain a large amount of
CC and try to work for NGO's. 

So personally after 4-5 years (10k hours) I suspect I should be quite
valuable. Nevertheless I was never a high achiever all my life, but I
have had decent success and definitely have some other things going
on for me. <!-- I also have heart! Pandian Le --> So I will have to
factor that in as well.

Chance to get into an NGO after 5 years in the realm of DS = 80%

<!-- check if I have used other chances of getting in NGO -->

Total chance = 80%\*93% = 74.4%

**Impact**

DS in top companies seems to be earning people top dollars. 
My friend in the US earns top dollar in Apple. Once you are Apple
worthy, there seems to be a lot of potential scope and growth. My dad
also recently reported someone in Facebook Earning top dollar. 

A simple bachelor's student in California in Data science from a
Waterloo university earns a base salary of 100k + stocks of 30k a year.

As far as I checked glassdoor and payscale, the pay in Netherlands
also seems to be higher than in DE. According to payscale DS's seem to
earn[ 53k](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/05582c7c/Amsterdam) and design engineers [40k](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Design_Engineer/Salary). I can easily find this
out by calling for a vacancy worst case. Not able to get proper
estimates on glassdoor, but it looks high.

Also DS is heavily hyped by 80k-hours for its ability to quickly turn
people in money making machines. 

>Data Incubator reports that its graduates can get starting salaries
>of $100K to $200K.

But I think some info that is missing is that these people who succeed
are not ordinary people. The interview process itself is rigorous.

So I bring my expectations down a little bit as to whether I can be
those crazy achievers. But I can apply and see where I stand.

I am not able to scoop it out but, last time I saw on glassdoor,
experience here is valued a lot as opposed to Design engineering.

>Most people move on to other jobs if they have more than 20 years'
>experience in this career. Experience has a moderate effect on pay
>for this job.- [Payscale-mechanical-engineering](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Mechanical_Engineer/Salary)

There is a lot of scope for direct impact if one has skills, by using
this science in companies like:

>including the Center for Disease Control, Google, Khan Academy, Bayes
>Impact and DataKind.

I will assume all NGO's to have same impact for now.


- Working for DS now and moving to an NGO within the next 5 years.

I assume the same impact irrespective of the NGO joined. By definition
an NGO worth joining is for sure recommended by 80k-hours for example.

So My impact is the same as that in 'DE for Direct work', i.e., 970 lives

- Working for DS now and staying in NL/europe

	- With compound interest of 4% a year
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- and 20% donation
	- for a beginners salary of [53k from Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/NL/Job=Data_Scientist/Salary/05582c7c/Amsterdam) 
	
200 lives.

- Working for DS now and moving to the US

	- With compound interest of 4% a year
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- and 20% donation
	- for a beginners salary of 130k (based on salary of Bachelor's
      student from waterloo university in DS working at Facebook)
	
392 lives for 35 years in the US + ~13 lives for the first 5 years in
NL= 400 lives.

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

- I should be enjoying the work
- Cleaning up the data will be boring, it takes up a lot of time.
- Basic needs will be satisfied mostly (money, hours and commute)
- Am not worried I will have too many problems learning or fitting in,
  my point being it is not investment banking.
- Again I look up to people in the US like my brother and other actual
  data scientists, they seem to have time to do other things as
  well. Not like they are working 24x7.
  
  Also 80k suggests that the hours are moderate 50 hrs per week I
  think. This is peacefully doable.
  
- Also this is expected to be a very satisfying career according to
  80k, due to the fast feedback cycle.

-Mentorship culture is quite common apparently according to 80k.

- project management could be even more fulfilling as PM have more
control, more responsibility than analysts who are just the right hand
for project managers, just like my DL in DE.

Overall, I suspect the time to be a little more, but keeping the
bigger picture in mind, that I am getting better at a potential skill
every extra hour I work, I shall not be cribbing about it then.
I will rank it as the same as DE then.


#### Management consulting

Finishing an MBA allows travel into a couple of venues, of which one
of them is MC. 80k-hours has done a [complete career profile on
them](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/). Based on [MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/), it appears that an MC does
just about anything that is needed to be done to improve the
performance of a company. The impression I get is that you are given
challenging problems and you have to come up with solutions for it. So
in a few months, you learn and work in teams and come up with a solution.

**Skills**

Management consulting is hyped by 80k for its [career
capital](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/). They seem to offer sufficient transferable skills. You
actually work in different problems and become a generalist in an
industry with quite some exit opportunities:

>work in an industry you served as a consultant, venture capital,
>private equity, policy/civil service, work on a “strategy team” for a
>company. [Career Capital 80k-hours](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/management-consulting/)

You can pretty much do a lot with such exit opportunities. i.e., go to
place where you think your resources are most needed?

>Although a significant portion of your time will be spent on
>preparing powerpoint presentations, email, and “grunt” tasks, such as
>creating databases, junior consultants gain responsibility relatively
>quickly, and work on solving challenging business problems.

We spend more time here and it appears to be filled with great things
in terms of CC such as learning, mentoring, regular feedback and tough
problems to grow on along with the top performing peers.

10.

**Connections**

<!-- Edit this again -->

It is likely to become more valuable in the future. But it well known
that we will meet our clients atleast in MC. And we are given lot of
responsibility right from the start.

Right from your colleagues everyone would be high-achieving and would
be the very bright people in the industry.

>An interviewee mentioned that the quality of the colleagues is
>generally seen as a major benefit of the job. Other alumni of the
>firm and contacts from individual projects give consultants a large
>number of valuable business contacts.

So I present this with 9? It seems like it is far apart from anything
I have seen before in either DS or DE. DS is also supposed to good
connections. But I will say this, if MC's are the top performers, if
tom dick and harry can become DS's, if MC's earn more than DS's, if
MC's connections are highly talked about by 80k-hours, if you know and
work with your peers who are brilliant, 

OK I will settle with an 8 considering DS is at 5. <!-- I am afraid it -->
<!-- is a feeling and that it is not well founded.-->

The connections we get here seem to be of a high level in the other
companies that we consult to, and also our colleagues most of them
would leave consulting after a few years.

 
**Credentials**

I think with MC you will make good credentials. I suppose you are
solving problems after problems. The exit opportunities look aplenty,
so I guess just knowing this is good enough. I will put it slightly
above DS as I suspect MC to be somehow superior in talent quality
effort needed to become the top person etc...

8.

**Runway**

MC's earn [30-50% of what IB's earn](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/). At the associate level you
earn 80k to 170k. This would probably allow you to donate in the 30%
brackets. It should give enough runway right in the first year I
think assuming I do not have any more loans and shit.

I don't think it is really a problem, I would earning a 100k+ salary
atleast. But nevertheless, I am looking at the next few years for
which the runway will be the same as for the job in DE in NL.

So a 6 or a 7.

**Personal fit**

>If the mean income of a hedge fund trader is $650,000, then that’s
>$20m over a 30 year career. If you donated half, that would be enough
>to cover the salaries of about 5 non-profit CEOs or 2-3 academic
>researchers, while still having a huge amount left to live on. 

<!-- This quote seems out of place and needs to probably go the -->
<!-- comparing section
-->

- Earning to give

  - Chances of clearing getting >730 in GMAT (70%)
  - Chances of clearing the scholarship criteria for RSM after
    getting 740 (60%).
	
	Look at my history, I have never been the top
    performer, of course, I can hope for things to be different, but
    will it really be, of course I will put my heart and soul this
	time. 60% is already a lot I guess.
	
	And considering that Time spent can improve skill.
	
  - MC jobs are highly competitive and 80k suggest to attach a 50%
    probability with it.
	
  - Chances of staying within the chosen field >5 years (60%)
  - Chances that I will deal with 60 hrs of work (85%)
  
  - There is a 1/8th chance of making it to partner(12.5%) by age 45,
    which is pretty killer.
  
  So this makes it I barely see myself put the time and effort to make
  partner now but if I can make 600k + bonus, why not. Only 1/8th
  associates make partner anyway. As partner though you could earn a
  freaking lot. We will estimate the impact later. But this is a path
  then for earning-to-give and in case you crash and burn, you have
  exit opportunities #career-capital and in my case maybe a
  citizenship in NL to continue DE or DS.
  
  So a total of :1.3% <!-- Investigate this whole idea of multiplying
  continuously, more the P numbers you have higher the chance of
  getting a super low number. Speak to RAm -->
  
- Earning to give once we leave industry after 5 years
  
  - Similar chances as above still apply.
  - Chance of clearing GMAT and getting a scholarship still make sense
    (42%)
  -~~Chance of getting the top MC job (50%)~~
  - Chance of getting a job that is paying similar to DS (70%)
  
  If I got this far then I should be somewhat good to begin with hence
  the probability.
  
  So in total 18.9
  
  - If I was able to come this far, I assume from there on it is easy
    to get a job and advance more quickly in the industry. I don't
    know how much I can earn, but I suspect it is atleast around 150k,
    which is like a normal salary in the US. All the big boys in big
    companies are MBA's. So push further work hard and see where it
    takes us. I am not estimating anything more than that for now.

>You can generally advance more quickly in industry by starting in
>consulting then entering industry several years later

- Working for an NGO after 3 years as MC

There are some chances of working say at the Gates Foundation or other
NGO's. But it is not a 100% clear how this would pan out. The impact
for doing this would be quite good, assuming that working at Gates
Foundation has atleast a similar impact as earlier calculated for 80k
and GiveWell. 

So the chances pan out to be:

  - Similar chances as above still apply.
  - Chance of clearing GMAT and getting a scholarship still make sense
    (42%)
  - ~~Chance of getting the top MC job (50%)~~
  - Chance of getting into a the likes of Gates Foundation (70%)
  
  In total it is 

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**
There is good feedback and training. Job satisfaction, although 60
hours needed can be gotten better than in IB and as we have
challenging projects it becomes more exciting. To me I am convinced,
that it will be challenging or overwhelming. 

Even if shit goes wrong try to sweat a few years and cash in on the
exit opportunities as possible.

Support conditions are a bit smaller than in DS or DE. I will keep it
at a 7 as compared to 8 from DS.

**Impact**

- Earning to give (partner after 45)

	- At associate level we get 130k 
	- after 5 years 250k
	- after 7 years 450k
	- 600k + bonus after 7 more years say
	- Donating 50%
	- inflation of 2%
	- I didn't take into account the bonuses which is expected to be a lot.

  We can expect to save upwards of 1250 lives

- Earning to give by once we leave industry in 5 years

	- With compound interest of 4% a year
	- inflation of 2% a year
	- increase of 10% every 5 years
	- and 30% donation
	- for a beginners salary of 150k (assumption i.e., after quitting
      MC)
	  
  This gives about 700 lives. <!-- one thing I am not confident about
  is at the age of 40 I should be earning in millions, is that even
  possible? Raaam? -->

- Direct working potential

970 lives same as any NGO over 35 years of working.

**Exit opportunities**

If MC turns out to be not for you after a few years, then MC seems to
have decent exit opportunities. People move on to do various things,
not exactly like a demotion.

- Move to industry that you worked as a consultant 

>You can generally advance more quickly in industry by starting in
>consulting then entering industry several years later.

- policy/civil service but not sure how age plays a factor.
- VC / PE, If I can't handle MC and go to PE, then why will I choose
  PE, which seems to be even more demanding, depending on where you
  join.



#### IB/ Finance/ Trading/private equity 

Based on the end appendix, I assume IB, Finance, Trading and PE all to
be similarly build regarding all the parameters I am using to compare.

**Skills**

Sufficient Exit opportunities in IB/PE. One can go to consulting even.

Skills in finance can apparently be earned within 6 months. After that
it is a mudane job.

Skills are good enough to transfer jobs even to MC and likely many
more exit opportunities occur.

**Connections**

It is likely to become more valuable in the future. But it is well known
 that we will meet our clients atleast in MC. And we are given lot of
 responsibility right from the start. [Investment banking on the other
 hand](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/152549/working-for-mckinsey-bain-and-boston-consulting-vs-goldman-jpm-and-morgan-stanley) is work in front of a PC most of the time and meeting
 clients does not happen very often especially within the first few
 years.
 
 6.
 
**Credentials**

I think with MC/IB you will make good credentials. You are making
crazy money, you have IB written on your resume.

8.0

**Runway**

After getting into IB runway might be crazy, but until then, the same
runway as in DE or DS exists.

7.

**Personal fit**

- Earning to give

  - Chances of clearing getting >730 in GMAT (70%)
  - Chances of clearing the scholarship criteria for RSM after
    getting 740 (60%) (same as in MC)
  - Chances of not burning out and quitting (10%)
  - getting a job in the top tier firm (50%)
  - Chances of staying for more than 5 years (10%)
  
  If in MC most people don't make partner and only 12.5% do, in IB I
  consider it to be even less.
  
  <!-- Maybe speaking to a few people might help .. Saw youtube video,
  fears are well founded. But need to check private equity and hedge
  funds and what those exit opportunities mean. Based on the footnotes

  So a total of :0.2%
  
- Earning to give once we leave industry after 5 years

Lets say same as in MC


**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

- Need to kiss ass
- Need to face time
- long freaking hours 80-100k
- No life what so ever but a lot of money
- mundane work

Need I go on?

I am really afraid of the idea of such a life.

3.

**Impact**

- Earning to give 

Assuming IB makes the same as PE and hedge funder
According to [80k-hours-trading](https://80000hours.org/2017/05/how-much-do-hedge-fund-traders-earn/), junior traders earn 300k - 3m per
year, this they reach within 8 years. More senior you get, the more
crazier it gets that Sr managers earn >10m$ "easily". 

Assuming average earnings of 800k over 30 years, it appears that one
can save 3771 lives.

- Exit after 5 years to something else

In 5 years we can save about 100-150 people, half of what can do in DE
or DS.

- Using skills earned to move to and NGO

NGO's not sure what skill applies. I don't have the confidence in
selecting this, so I am going to just assume the same figures as in
MC.


<!-- What happens once you exit nah mean? What skills do you got? -->

<!-- Should I investigate trading a bit further? or hedge funds? -->

**Exit opportunities**
What is it?   asd    
#### Programming, Machine learning PhD 

Apparently, learning to program could also be a gateway to DS,
Quantitative Finance, tech entrepreneurship, research and freelance
development. Useful in a multitude of industries, highly
transferable. But I am far from being a programmer. I still think DS
is the first place to start, as it allows me to immediately move to
the other industry and start gaining experience.

Also I am not sure how I will compete with all those programmers who
have been programming since they were kids. So I need time and a lot
of it. The same goes for Machine Learning PhD. So instead of staying
in DE I will go to DS, which already has some programming. I will pick
it up from there more about programming.

<!--  I think I need to understand what it means to programm. i.e, -->
<!--  what job I can do and what is the min. requirement to do that. -->

These could result in being the most fulfilling careers, but that is
not the only motive here. 

So for now I will start with 

But maybe then you decide to go into programming instead of DS..

<!-- need to check this out instead -->

#### Economics PhD

<!-- Difference between Econ PhD and Data science. I think I would  -->
" Economics PhDToo far-fetched, based on the link I studied. As I am
already 27 and it takes quite some effort to get to the point of
applying. I don't have the means or the scope to go into this any
further. " - Is how I started. ;)

**Skills**: 9

- Excellent job prospects

Lowest unemployment rate amongst any science and engineering PhD's

- Can go into wide variety of jobs after PhD (highly transferable?)
 
  Academia as well as jobs in policy, think tanks, NGO research, World
  banks, IB, Consulting
  
- Good safety net even if not in Academia


**Connections**:6

Probably not much, but you get credentials which are very good which
can allow you to get connections. No during a PhD I suppose.

**Credentials**:8

PhD in Economics. Gives you credentials to go into some of the most
important direct work jobs.

Some rhetoric I keep hearing in the few sites I have visited is about
how you earn a signal:

>C explained that one of our main jobs as agency economists was to
>think about the big picture and be the voice of 'common sense' in the
>room. It is surprisingly difficult to find people who can do this,
>and the 'PhD Economist' credential is a signal that you might be the
>kind of person who can escape groupthink and see neglected but
>important side effects and chains of causality.

<!--  talk think tanks to kat's friend -->

**Runway**: 5

It is what comes with a DE. But it is worth to consider the money I
might have during an Econ PhD. The salary is around 15k$/year with
during an Econ PhD. But with jobs I think I can easily make >100k now,
so after 7 years not sure.

**Personal fit** : 2

First I need to answer the probability of getting in top
20 colleges if I start pursuing Econ Phd from now.

- Chances of getting 165+ in GRE quants (90%)

I love math. I have always loved it. I love it when things get
technical. I love LA, Calculus, ODE etc... It has all been part of my
Gate training and I didn't shy from learning from very good Authors.

- Chances of learning Economics enough to get into top 20? (70%)

>An economics major isn’t required but you need proven math ability
>and it helps to have taken mathematical economics classes.

I don't know anything about economics and need to see how I fare by
taking some courses. I can take some courses and see how I fare. I am
not sure this is proof, but I think I can do better in math with
practice and I am sure it would be fun. Chances that I fare well
(i.e., scoring>80/100) once I take a few econ courses I guess is 70%

- Chances of a getting an Econ Phd within top 20 (other factors) (70%)

Top 10 is more respected with better placement at tenure track and has
[less variance in results](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NkhkJxVzqbTG1PZFNyMEN0bEU/view). But I think it needs more work and is
quite far-fetched for me currently.

Looking here (person from non-quants
background)](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/)
and [here (complete guide to getting an Economics PhD)](https://qz.com/116081/the-complete-guide-to-getting-into-an-economics-phd-program/) regarding
what is needed to get into the top 5, already informs me sufficiently
that top 20 might still be hard.

Of course being from a "non-quants background", I don't know what
exactly applies to me when compared to the journey of this [philosophy
student](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/ ) who wants to get into top 5ish. I am looking at more like
top 20 and I think the requirements could be relaxed. I need some
consultation though.

- prepared to work for long hours (95%)

I have done it in the past. Currently, I clock about 11 hrs on 4
weekdays per week, and still manage to go to the gym. 80k-hours says
that I should be prepared to do 70+ hours a week (10 hrs a
day). Atleast during the first year of studies according to
[econdjobrunours](https://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/how-many-hours-do-you-work-at-various-phases-of-your-phd-studies/page/2). So I don't really see it as a problem, if this
is the way of life for the next 5 years then there might be a problem,
but I am not too much worried about it.

- Research roles interest (80%)

Love intellectual pursuits and have a strong drive to do self-
directed research? Can what I am doing now be considered as an answer
to the question?

Anyways, Not sure. I have done some research in the past with my thesis
and my work in IIT, I am not really sure how different this is, but as
long as I can make it challenging and solve amazing problems
(intellectually satisfying) I can't see why it would be a problem. +
with available extra hours I would like to see what else I can work on
and improve.

I am quite afraid of the anxiety due to unsupervised thesis work
though.

But if your research is completely your own, I would take the most
important topic for me and try to do and learn everything I can about
it. I would take something like poverty for example.

So the chance of completing decently an Econ Phd within top 20 is: 33.5%

1. Success here is defined as getting into academia or a government
organization and getting the [rare chance](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) of making crazy impact
(to be read as 400 lives over a lifetime by a particular act) in
addition to donations possible as a result of the job.

Everyone gets a job in the end with an Econ Phd. But being able to
save another 400 lives [comes rarely.](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html)+ another 50 lives based on
advocacy. I weigh this at 20%. Seems high based on what I have read,
but still.

This puts us at 6% in total. 

2. Success can still be achieved with MC or other private sector jobs

- Chances of finding a job in general is high (85%)

>I completed my PhD in Econ (well Applied Econ) last year at an
>unranked school, and had little trouble finding a good job. The
>academic job market wasn't very receptive, but I received a fair

>pretty easy. -[Noahpinion comments](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html)

This puts us at a personal fit of 29%.

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction** 7


Very solid safety net, except for during the PhD where there is less
feedback and more anxiety. Either you become a tenure track academic,
or a non-tenure track academic or go to a job in policy or consulting
etc...

It is known that Economics PhD can be intellectually satisfying.

**Impact**

1. Impact including the [rare chance](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) would be

	- impact of the rare chance 400 lives
	- impact due to advocacy 100 lives (pure guess) 
	- impact due to a jobs paying greater a median acdemic salary of
		108k Compounded at 4% with inflation of 2%, 20% donations and
		10% hike every 5 years (243 people)
		
In total 750 lives

2. Impact not including the [rare chance](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) would be 

	- impact from taking up an MC job followed by the many exit
      opportunities for 30 years (lesser time than that in the MC
      profile considered above) is about 500 lives
	- impact due to advocacy 50 lives (pure guess)

#### Working at an effective Altruism organization 

**Skills**

DS or research as an Analyst/content writer is as far as I see myself
going in. When I think of skills, I think of transferable
skills. Skills that will make me so valuable that I can transfer
ideally transfer from one profession to another.

The best skill is given by MC is the first assumption.

With such a research job, I am not sure where I can go next other than
within the EA community.Over the course of a few years, I rely heavily
on my connections to help me out for another job. Once I spent 6-7
years in it, what will I do next if it doens't work out? Rather than
that EA jobs seem to suck with transferable skills, unless in
management or administration is my guess. Research jobs where I
currently see my best fit involve lot of critical thinking etc... but
what type of jobs in the private sector can I go to afterwards, let
alone them paying a lot.

I suspect the job to be demanding and so I would say learning other
things on the side might be a little hard.

There is very litle on the job training, and lack of senior
mentorship. And the expertise is tied to the EA movement (unlike MC
for example).

>People sometimes worry that working at effective altruist
>organisations doesn’t lead to concrete foreseeable future career
>options. As we’ve argued above, you are likely to build skills and
>connections which mean you’ll have good opportunities in the
>future. However you might still feel uneasy not knowing what the
>future holds, even if on reflection you believe that you’ll have good
>future career options.

For the reasons stated above I give it a 6.5 to factor in some
uncertainty.

Yes it seems to be good with connections and credibility but not
really transferable skill. You can however work different roles or
mixed roles based on ones fit.

<!-- what about the other things you can learn? -->

**Connections**

There is little doubt regarding the connections I could make when I
want to be in the EA community [as exclaimed in this epic article by
80k ](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#how-good-is-the-career-capital) and [by the person who worked in GiveWell](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/). But my
connections seem to only belong here and around here. 

I think I am again saying that I can't hop between industries but only
within the EA movement. 

I am talking as though that is a bad thing. Well 80k exclaims, what if
EA grows down in popularity, I feel like I would be completely
abandoned. Where as if I did MC or DS I find my relavance in a wide
variety of places.

>If you think the EA community will keep growing, then the value of
>these connections just gets stronger over time.

But as I am looking for connections to improve my chances of success
in EA, I give it a solid 8.

**Credentials**

They are less prestigious than Google, Mckinsey or World bank, but
nevertheless some of the organizations have terrific credentials like
having gone through Y-combinator etc...

>Can get impressive achievements due to high levels of responsibility
> Some impressive affiliations (Y Combinator, Oxford, Good Ventures)
> Less brand recognition

Sounds like an 7. I don't think though that it beats DS cred. Atleast
there is some uncertainty.

**Runway**

I think I can transition to this job say by doing an internship at one
of the foundations. So this is could be sooner than I think. Of course
the current Runway of DE will make sense for it which would stand at
6.0. But also the earnings of EA work are very low and I am going to
say that with EA getting an 18 month runway would take even more
time. As they almost pay the lowest.

Without 18k in the bank don't go into this?

>As with other startups, there is a risk of your organisation running
>out of funding (though this hasn’t happened to any of the major
>organisations), or substantially changing its strategy, meaning you
>could lose your job.

**Personal Fit**

I think I am not yet a personal fit, but I can quickly get up to speed
with what they want and start working for them asap.

- Ability to gain Experience (80%)

> A track record of engaging with research in the community and making
> productive contributions to it.
  
  I don't know how I am supposed to get experience before working in
  an EA organization.
  
  But I can try doing other things, like starting an EA org in my city
  or working 80k or someone offline, producing some work for them and
  showing how much I am worth.
  
  I could also do an internship now or apply for it and plan for 2
  months next year if this is the highest impact career. i.e, do
  everything in my capability to get all the experience I need. 
  
  I mean what else is there to do in life.
  
- Relevant disciplines can be easily studied and skills built (85%)

>Having studied relevant disciplines at university, such as economics,
>statistics, philosophy or another quantitative field, helps, but
>isn’t necessary.

This I can compensate for by working on it by myself at home.

Personal fit involves how successful I will be if I pursue an EAO and
work with them and create the impact I need.

Seems like a very complex problem 

- Care about EA (90%)

> They really care about effective altruism, and are happy to talk
> about it all day.

What else is there to do in life?

- Can you manage your time and be efficient and self-directed? (85%)

With more responsibility I will thrive. I thrive in new situations and
learn quickly literally anything. I have demonstrated my level at my
current company and my internship atleast (based on the feedback I
have received. 

I am always looking for hard problems to solve.

>They’re self-directed, able to manage their time well, they can
>create efficient and productive plans, and keep track of complex
>projects.

I think I would waste time, but with regular feedback I can
improve.

I have never really been on high alert except for during my work at
IIT or my entire masters. But then basically I worked all the time to
ensure success, as nothing was more important than this.

I am not sure how good I am, but I think I can manage a decent job and
will get better based on how important the job is to me I guess.

- Managing in case you loose your current job or the startup crashes
  (80%)

It is possible the EA movement as a whole loses it's momentum? If I
loose my job, atleast I am part of the community and would have built
some contacts.

If I loose my job right in the beginning, and can't find anything
tangible, then I can always go back to where I belong. If I loose my
job for whatever reason say after 5-10 years then it appears I should
have enough contacts to pull me through this.

i.e., Exit opportunities earlier are fine and later might revolve
around how I set it up with my connections.

But it is scary, say you have to move to the US, and then you find
that you loose your job, yes it is scary. But that is with any startup
and sometime you got to take your chances, with a good plan C

In total I would have 41.6%.

**Impact**

- Looking at number of lives due to this direct work

I assume working at an Effective EAO will allow me to save 970 lives
as detailed in the appendix. or more.

Also...

- Talent constrained vs funding constrained

Many organizations are talents

**Exit options**

>- Well positioned for senior positions in EA organizations

>- Connections in EA community allow exits into wide range of sectors

Perfect.

Main point with any career is build your connections and create value.

What about don't do direct work yet?

**Satisfying conditions**

I really hope. It's going to be EA 24*7? Let's see.

8.0 is the guess.       



#### Other interesting options

Mixture of 2 industries

DS + DE

DS + finance

Programming + finance


#### Working @ effective non profits

Seems to be the same as working at an EAO, but more detailed. I will
skip it for now.

I remember reading in 80k-hours the importance of not working in an
NGO now but working on it later than now. First build CC and then come
back, as it is easier to go one way than the other.

**Skill building**

>For the most part, we discourage people from working at non-profits
>at the start of their career, because top private sector jobs, like
>consulting, tend to offer more flexible career capital — the skills,
>connections and credentials that put you in a better position to make

>This is because top private sector jobs let you build connections
>with talented colleagues who go into a wide range of sectors, give
>you widely recognised credentials, and often give you better training
>than non-profits. It’s also more common to go from the corporate
>sector into non-profits than the other way around, so if you’re
>considering both, it can be better to work in the corporate sector
>first.

Training wise, advice wise it, considering working at both corporate
and non-profits would mean to gain work first at the corporate sector.

The goal right now is not to create the highest impact yet.. but to
make flexible career capital the most important thing in the world.

As per the frequent words from 80k-hours, working in an NGO should not
be the first thing to do for 2 reasons:

1. Experience is not really considered epic here

We rather learn much much more in the industry and then make the jump
to use our skills to make lives better.

2. Going to another job from here would be hard.

Going back to the industry would be hard. The skills that we gain in
the industry are much more valuable.

**Skills**

Transferable skills: for now its risky so 5

**Connections**

Yes in the field, but if shit goes wrong with the EA moment or that
there is a funding contraint as these are startups. It would be better
to rely on real world corporate experience first.

#### Founding a startup

There seems to be a lot of pointing towards learning to program and
learning the business. I guess that any skill you learn is useful nad
anything you are very good at will put you in a better place to
startup.


**Skills**

>Starting a tech company will force you to rapidly learn highly useful
>entrepreneurial and technical skills, meet lots of people, and it
>looks impressive (even if your business eventually fails, at least in
>failure-tolerant cultures such as the US and UK). Overall, we think
>it’s one of the best options for career capital.

For CC it appears to be really good, as we are usually all-rounders
while working for or co-founding a small startup.

While attempting to find a job once your startup tanks I am not sure
how good it is, but if you have the skills to start up and get a seed
accelerator, you must be having some skills. As pointed out by 80k in
the above quote, even if you fail, depending on the failure tolerant
cultures, you should be still able to pull it off get good career
capital.

It should atleast be an 8. Points are low due to uncertainty. 


**Connections**

You will probably meet a ton of people in the community, possibly some
influential people,depending on how good you are. If they will help me
to find opportunities and spread ideas later, it is not clear, but
likely based on how good they know you are.

Beware of [some horror stories and the connections as a result](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-startup-accelerator-and-incubator-horror-stories).

I will just assign it to be less than MC. This is primarily due to
uncertainity. (7)


**Credentials**

Having gone quite far with a startup might already serve as reasonable
credentials.

But doing this is quite hard. So I guess it at 6 points due to the
uncertainty.

**Runway**

Starting up takes time, before you get the minimum wage to live after
being accepted by an incubator, there is a lot of work to be done on
your own time. 

Current runway is important, and future runway to build will take a
long time.

Current runway depends on the job that I am doing currently and it
would take me 3 years of earning in DE to make that much of money. So
a 6.

**Personal fit**

>Consider this career if you think you can develop strong technical
>skills, as well as the ability to deal with high risk of failure,
>work very long hours and do something unconventional.

>The high risk of entrepreneurship also means that it’s likely not
>enough people pursue it in order to gain personal status or wealth,
>so society is likely to be undersupplied with entrepreneurs. One

>One concern is that some companies within technology have been
>accused of exploiting addictive tendencies to gain users, so the fact
>that a product gains lots of users may be a poor indication of its
>value in these cases.

> Highly unsure of average impact.

In order to estimate personal fit I will look at the chances. I assume
success to be able to get into Y-combinator and come out as a
successful business as:

- Chance of having the vision to be a Y-combinator level startup and
applying (5%)	

This seems like a lot especially considering my current level of
skills. But I do pick up things relatively fast, and can work long
hours. For now, lets just role with that number.

- chance of getting accepted in Y-combinator (2.5%)
- Chance of that startup succeeding (25% based on current
  [Ycombinator list](https://yclist.com/) of 11 years)
- = 0.03% (by multiplying everything)

**Supportive conditions/Job Satisfaction**

I suspect there might be stress due to lack of funding, long hours are
there here, but I barely see myself complaining. There is a high
degree of autonomy and I have a personal stake in the situation. I
should definitely try it out with some decent skill or always be on
the lookout for some opportunities.

6.

I am not worried about it though!

**Impact**

I estimate the impact of starting up in tech to be
 - Total donations per annum (60% of [2.5m$](https://80000hours.org/2014/05/how-much-do-y-combinator-founders-earn/#fn:5))
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 30
 - Increase in salary = 0% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 0% increase
 - ~8k lives
 

#### Startup employee

I guess I need to split it as an additional contribution.

We expect lower impact, risk and personal demands than a co-founder, 

>If you get the opportunity to join a startup that’s taking off, you
>may have greater earnings and impact by joining it than founding your
>own e.g. the 100th employee of Dropbox still made about $10m,
>equivalent to a 10% stake in a $100m company. -
>[Startup-employee-80000-hrs](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/startup-early-employee/)

The situation we envision and work out odds for is that, we join at
the beginning of a taking off startup and we are say 50-100 employees
into a big ass startup.

I keep the values for this quite rough. To me this appears as an
option in addition to something I choose. When I am at the position of
applying for jobs, that is when I should evaluate how important it is.

**Skills**

Depends on startup and the things you do, for example, DE, or DS or
management etc... Lets give it an 8, assuming that if you are one of
the first 50-100 employees you are probably given a lot of
responsibility and somehow the skills and knowledge become
transferable.

8.

**Connections**

Depending on the job and whom we have to interact with we might have
much larger set of connections.

Whether these connections will get you somewhere? depends and for the
uncertainty, it gets 6.

**Credentials**

It is very uncertain and depends on the field of choice. I say this
because the Credentials I have evaluated are different based on the
fields chosen.

Usually though if it is a high impact startup then you probably have
better credentials. I think this is tough to evaluate. I give it a
value of 7, sort of like an average of the fields I have seen until now.

**Runway**

Will be lower than a normal job in the beginning. 6.0 in the beginning
I guess.


**Personal fit**

As said earlier I will evaluate this further in the coming days when I
am in the lookout say for a job.

I am already working in a startup. When talking about how successful I
will be? 

Unfortunately the odds are that of how successful any startup would be
or how a startup would grow to be the next Airbnb etc... We will use
the same numbers as in `Founding a startup section`.

0.03%. The personal fit is ofcourse only for the extra contribution.

**Impact**

Impact in a startup is estimated at 8k lives. 

>Instead of receiving about 20% of the company’s equity, as a founder
>would, you’ll receive 0.1% – 1% depending on your role and how early
>you join, and you’ll receive more of your compensation as salary
>rather than equity. - [80k-hours startup employee](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/startup-early-employee/)

So the resulting impact is expected to be, lets say 0.5% of 8k = 40
in addition to the impact a normal engineer would have over his
lifetime, which is about 200-300 lives.

Of course there are other ways of increasing the number of lives
saved, but these could just well be our conservative estimates.

**Supporting conditions**

It cannot be as intense as it is for the co-founder. This is pretty
much the impression I get. Trainings and learnings from experienced
people might not really be present here. 

It would be a lot of responsibility. Might have good autonomy and
decent working hours. It will certainly fit with the rest of my life

#### software engineering

**Entry**

Easy to enter apparently with a year of work, but as a junior software
developer.

> Many people can get an entry-level job after around a year of
> part-time learning, or you can do a full-time twelve-week coding
> bootcamp, such as App Academy. Be careful to avoid low-quality

>This profile focuses on software engineers employed by large
>technology companies,


**Skills**

- gain skills that there is a shortage off

- exit opportunities include: data science, quantitative finance, tech
entrepreneurship, research and freelance work.

>Knowing programming is also helpful in many other industries and is
>likely to become more valuable in the future. 

Not much scope for other things besides programming such as
entrepreneurship or work with different organizations like in
consulting.

There is some scope for management level roles as you progress.

So skills are transferable and is usually a decent fit for earning to
give, not so much direct work unless you find something to do in your
freetime that somehow improves this.

**Connections**

Being at large companies gives possibility to make connections with
wealthy and influential people many of whom might want to do good.

6.5 due to the hype and factoring for uncertainity.

**Credentials**

Working at top-tier companies already gets you lot of prestige
apparently comparable to working in finance or consulting

Assuming getting into top companies is only a matter of effort, I give
it a close 7.5 as compared to MC.

**runway**

Even at google the estimated salary is 300k at max.

US seems to be the place to be and further more silicon valley and
possibly after a killer bootcamp.

Runway for now is still with DE. Once I get a job in real programming
an earn decently ofsourse, it should not be a problem.

But I need time and so the thing of DE applies.

**Personal fit**

The impression I get based on [80k hrs profile on SE](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/software-engineering/) is that:
- humanities and science people have done it by their own
- need to demonstrate strong interest in programming

<!-- talk to suruta mudi to get some ideas -->

>We’ve seen many cases of people with humanities and social science

Beware this is for the entry level.

One of the comments:

There is web development, app development and OS development

>The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 22% growth in US
>employment of software engineers from 2012-22, which is much higher
>than the growth rate for all occupations (11%).

But it doesn't seem to be building skills for direct working I
think. Especially that of an analyst, or an organization person. I
could be a web developer and develop apps for them though, but I don't
at this moment see this taking off in that direction.

It comes with decent exit opportunities, but when will I move to it ?

-Chance of making it to google in the US (60%)

- Chance of learning the skills of being google worthy in Europe (80%)
 
48%

**Impact**

Assuming I start with a salary of 120 k at google in the next 5 years.
- with an increase in salary of 4%
- inflation of 2%
- every 5 year increase of 10%

Can save about ~400 people. In addition I could work on some advocacy,
and direct work due to the available time. I will just estimate that
at say another 20 lives (wild ass guess)

There is possibility to do more, by working remotely say from
Thailand.

**Supporting conditions**

##  calculations
  
#### Impact calculations derivations
##### Calculating impact of direct working in 80k-hours

**Problem**

80k-hours has changed the lives of 1k people over 8 years. Per change
the cost is about 1337$. We seek to estimate the contribution of an
analyst in case he joins 80k-hours.

**Assumptions or guesses** 

80k is a reputed NGO, that is committed to creating massive impact. It
is one such organization which I would want to join with the hopes of
creating large impact.

They are about 15 people excluding advisors, 2 co-founders, 6 core
members, 3 freelancers and 4 operations people. 

My contribution would be 1.8% of the whole company, in the first year
assuming my contribution is [10%](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) of the co-founder, and the core
team and management team at 30% and 10% each respectively.

<!-- **Other factors** -->
<!-- - contribution of the donors -->
<!-- - Contribution of the analyst assuming he is replaceable -->

**Factors:**

- contribution of 80k to the total lives saved by the changed lives
  (based on 80k's plan) (20%) (guess based on one of the profiles)
- contribution of 80k with the donors money (40%)(based on [GiveWell
  estimate](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/))
- contribution from the analyst when he is replaceable (10%) (
  [GiveWell estimate](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/))
- Contribution to the analyst is 1.18% of the whole company (as in
  assumptions and guesses)
- The minimum number of lives saved by anyone whose plans have been
  changed is assumed to be what I can contribute at my easiest. i.e.,
  working at DE for the rest of my life and donating 15%. Easy. Comes
  to about 222 lives. (derived above)
  
  Although I think 10% is a fair number to assume for donations, I
  suspect that with the change in plan based on 80k-hours
  intervention, the impact could be atleast 1.5 times than what I
  could have done without 80k-hours.
  
- Number of plans changed in a year = 457 on average and is growing
(last 2 years plans changed was >1k)

**The calculation**

- Number of lives saved would thus be: 457*222 lives per year

- Number of lives saved by an analyst per year = Multiplying by all
  factors with the number of lives saved in total per year= 10 lives
  
- If this grows compounded at 2% with 1% inflation in costs and a 10%
  hike every 5 years for the next 40 years, we get **626 lives**.
  
**Reflection on the calculation**

- I feel like I have been heavily hoping for this answer to turn out
  ridiculously large say in k's of people saved. But its only 2-3x more
  than what I could save just being a design engineer. I want to say
  JUST 2x more, but I will wash my mouth. 
  
  >Stanford economists have demonstrated that the average value of a
  >year of quality human life is actually closer to about $129,000.
  
  I am very STUPID. It is not the difference between 200 and 600 rs my
  dear motherfucker, it is the goddamn difference between 25 million
  to 75 million $ in value, and that too just for one year.  (My
  internal bells just went off!  essay writing you rock)
  
  Looking at this, even if I spend 4k on a saving a fucking life,
  imagine the value I create. It is very easy to fall for shit due to
  my scope insensitivity, but pandians are awake and kicking now. 
  
  Even if we assume the value to the cost of saving a life alone,
  right now. To save 200 lives and to save 600 lives is the goddamn
  difference between saving 800k$ and 2.4mill$ over a life time. It
  might not do a lot inside, but mind you, you are scope
  insensitive. Shut up and multiply has never been so resounding
  inside my head this much. A year later it starts to make sense.
  
- The numbers produced here seem conservative and very rough, with
  the estimates of my contribution as well as the number of
  plans changed (as we take average and not the current)
  
  Changing the numbers a bit, and making it less conservative, I
  stumble upon another rough estimate of about 2777 lives per
  lifetime per person.
  
  So I would say there is a possibility of saving 600 to 3000 lives
  over the next 40 years for me while doing direct work.
  
- Another estimate of value created by working [@ GiveWell is
  $97,900](https://80000hours.org/2016/08/reflections-from-a-givewell-employee/) which translates to about 1500 lives roughly over 40
  years (compounded at 2% with 1% inflation in costs and a 10%
  interest every 5 years)
  
- I guess it is more about the ball park or the relatively larger good
  you can do by working in EAO's such as GiveWell.
  
- Recently I came across an argument regarding ["Why I am not
  replaceable"](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#why-is-working-at-an-ea-organisation-high-impact), by 80k hrs. And it argued that if I take
  up job at an EAO, then I free up the other person who is "supposed
  to replace me" to do other good things. 
  
  Also most organizations are talent constrained rather than funding
  constrained, adding more points to the above argument regarding
  replaceability.
  
  And in that case the GiveWell estimate would go from 97k to 970k/
  year.
  
  But, 
  
  >To get a sense of how much value you create by working at an EA
  >organisation, we asked the organisations how much funding they
  >would have traded for their most recent hire. They gave an average
  >of $126,000 – $505,000 and a median of $77,000 – $307,000 per
  >year.
  
  It appears that assuming yourself as not completely replaceable as
  well as assuming yourself completely replaceable might not be a good
  estimate. We will fall in between and based on the expected value an
  EAO thinks of us, it appears that the 97k is indeed a nice
  conservative number and we will stick with the impact calculated as
  a result which is 970 lives over 40 years. 
  
  
##### Calculating the impact of working in design engineering

I estimate the impact of being an engineer as
 - Total donations per annum (20% of 46k$)
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 40
 - Increase in salary = 4% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 10% increase
 - 20% donation per year
 - = <200
 
 
I estimate the impact of starting up in tech to be
 - Total donations per annum (60% of [2.5m$](https://80000hours.org/2014/05/how-much-do-y-combinator-founders-earn/#fn:5))
 - cost of one life (4k$)
 - Inflation = 2% in cost of life 
 - Number of years of donation = 40
 - Increase in salary = 5% max per annum
 - Job change every 5 years with 12.5% increase
 - ~38k lives
 
## Plan

This post is going to serve as a summary, before I apply to 80k-hours. I see an stm talk about 21k words etc... on his wall.

For me the problem with so many words is having to rewrite the whole thing(not
motivating), 

But I see time and again that he is trying to write a lot. Somehow, for some
reason he belives that writing is everything, or writing helps in solving what
he wants!


### P.S

Working at the library from 8:11 with a small pee break. Set up
markdown mode coloring, figured out how to add comments in markdown mode.


## Analysis
  * [x] Fix the bug of impact of Top NGO's
  * [x] add 80k results and do some checking
  * [x] Add 80k resutls and write results of sanity check for each
        section
  * [ ] Confirm that you needn't change anything
  * [ ] Conclude results per division CC, Total impact, also
        induvidual impact and finally multiply with the personal fit
        and inform the findings.
		
I have now two sets of data one that I made including my personal fit,
all based on articles mostly from 80k. The other being the set of data
from[ 80k's career reviews](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) summary with their own evaluation of the
numbers.

**Why didn't I use the numbers from 80k directly**

For me I wanted to compare impact across all types of saving
lives. Plus I made some subdivisions of each profession trying to
gauge how useful it would be if I went in one direction instead of the
other within the same career. For example, MC as ETG or MC followed by
DW. I could have probably extrapolated from 80k numbers now in
hindsight. 

I guess I still could.

**Performing the sanity check:**

For Career Capital: The ranking goes as 

| rank | My result     | rank 80k |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 1    | MC            | 1        |
| 2    | Econ PhD      | 2        |
| 3    | IB            | 3        |
| 4    | DS            | 2        |
| 5    | Working @ NGO | 2        |
| 6    | Starting up   | 2        |
| 7    | DE            | -        |

80k-hours evaluates DS better than IB in CC. But if you can go from IB
to MC, PE, hedge funds and other exit opportunities, I don't see why
it is bad in CC. IB on the resume seems to sound fancier than DS.

But this is not the deal breaker.  I don't see the need to make it
more accurate as personal fit will be the deal breaker anyways.

For Impact:

I compute total impact to the extent possible by translating
everything into equivalent money possibly generated and then translate
it to lives by dividing it with 4000 $(The cost of a life according to
AMF).

With 80k-hours these are just points to individual impact. So I don't
know if we can directly compare direct earning and direct impact. In
other words, is the 5 star rating in direct impact and a 5 start
rating in Earning and that of the career capital equal to each other.

Adding them directly I compare the result:

| rank | Work                            | rank (80k) |
|------|---------------------------------|------------|
| 1    | Starting up                     | 1          |
| 2    | IB(ETG)                         | 3          |
| 3    | MC(as a partner)                | 3          |
| 4    | Direct working @ EAO (DS etc..) | 1          |
| 5    | Econ PhD. with rare chance      | 6          |
| 6    | MC (exit after 5 year)          | -          |
| 7    | DS/SE in the US                 | 5          |
| 8    | DE in the US                    | -          |
| 9    | DS in Europe                    | -          |
| 10   | DE in Europe                    | -          |

I find my estimates to be reasonable.

- Based on mainly 80k text I generate these values as much as I can
assuming every 4k$ saves 1 life.

- I am not sure if the 80k scale is made to be directly added.

- I have attempted to consider a type of career within a career
  category. For example, within MC I look at MC primarily for direct
  giving and MC for earning. This is generally not done by 80k-hours.
  
  I think what 80k hrs might have with their scaling is that they show
  the maximum capabilities in direct working and earning or
  advocacy. Unlike what I have done, as a person can probably pursue
  one activity primarily and not all of them simultaneously.

With this I conclude the section on impact, reasonable as well.

Supporting conditions/ Job satisfaction:

| rank | My result |
|------|-----------|
| 1    | DE        |
| 2    | EAO       |
| 2    | DS        |
| 2    | Startup   |
| 5    | MC        |
| 5    | Econ PhD  |
| 6    | IB        |

No supportive conditions details given in the 80k directory. But it
can be derived based on their career profiles.

But I don't care about it too much except for working crazy hours like
in IB, or that I have to uselessly sit in an office and do mundane
work.


Personal fit:

### Question to Ram

1. Can I multiply prolties? Is there a better way to do this while
   comparing different options

So I am attempting to estimate which career is my best fit. In order
to do that I look at the chances of an event A, B to G. I multiply all
of these chances to get my personal fit.

The problem is though, with every career, my events are quite
different and the number of events also are different.

Also, the more number of events I have my personal fit automatically
goes down big time. 80% probabilities in 2 events will give me a very
bad personal fit of 64%.

Can you comment on if this is the way of the world or can I do better?

2. What is the best way to estimate lifetime salary.

My typical approach is assume a salary growth of 4% an inflation of 2%
and 10% increase every 5 years and take it all the way till I am 70.

By doing this my estimate really large salaries when I am say 70. I am
afraid it is realistic. So for example, my current salary is 40k/year,
I claim it to become 362k/year when I am 70.

Sometimes I really know what the salary is going to be at a certain
level and then I use that directly, say in the case of Management
Consulting.

Is there a better approach? Your thoughts on what I can do better and
what I am doing wrong.

No supportive conditions details given in the 80k directory. But it
can be derived based on their career profiles.

But I don't care about it too much except for working crazy hours like
in IB, or that I have to uselessly sit in an office and do mundane
work.

Total

It appears that **DS for direct giving** would be the best to choose,
looking at CC, impact and Personal fit together.

  * [ ] One thing I want to check is how CC and Impact are compared to
        gether.
		
An Econ Phd would be the next best thing, if we don't really try to
1work in the government and look out for that rare chance as an
analyst.

It is very suprising that DS for ETG at NL is the third option,
followed by DE for earning to give.

The personal fit plays a mightly role in all of this I guess.

I am early in my career (27) and would like to place more weight on
flexible CC.

1. IT of EAO = CC of MC ; Everything from there could just be a linear
extrapolation.

Seems to be a reasonable estimate I think. I do not want to match it
to the IT of IB as it then makes IT of EAO look really low (looking at
it linearly). Which seems to not be the case.

80k gives Direct impact capabilities a max rating when one works in an
EAO. 

Also there could be other career profiles that could have much larger
impact say 100k lives. If I take them to be the gold standard then
everything else will have a small number compared to CC. 

I think what I am doing here is compare achievable CC to Achievable
impact. This sounds reasonable?

Well! 

Atleast it seems to not make sense to compare to a president. 

Is it possible to somehow estimate the impact worth of CC and equate
it to EAO.

In my head I have already made the decision that IT of EAO = CC of
MC. I am only trying to prove it right I think. 

I shall comeback to this later I guess. for now, this seems fine.

2. Rate max best CC as 10 and best IT as 10.

But the problem is that impact is like very non linear. There is
impact of 400 and there is like 10 times its impact.

Say I know something that can save 8k lives and then something that
can save 400 lives. 8 lives can be 10 and 400 lives can be 0.5. But
then in CC, IB could have a max 10 and DE could have a 5 already. If
we add it up directly then the contribution of impact is so low for
DE. What does this mean? I 

I am afraid it is not weighed properly

Define properly. If there is an accepted number of CC which can
correlate with Impact. Maybe even then we have lot of problems. 

  * [ ] I feel too confused. I would like to get the data out
again. Look at 3-4 cases only and decide how I am going to compare and
weight the different alternatives.

  * [ ] look at the 80k guide
  
  or just keep it as it is and go forward. Don't do the adding?


Skip this. Don't need to add and compare. Seems pointless when I have
no idea what it means. It seems like just a ranking.

### Looking at the ranking

The second best option seems to be DS in NL as ETG. Shocked! I guess
it is because of the ridiculous personal fit that this has happened.
IB is out of the question. I am really afraid of burning out, the way
of work is quite unhealthy and I need to take care of myself for
serving mankind on the long run.

**CC**
MC seems promising CCwise. But say I find out I am not partner
material or I didn't get a scholarship or the hours are sick, then ETG
is not really an option, so I have to move out. When I move out yes I
can do other things, join a company bla bla and rise the ranks. What I
am uncertain about this is being able to work in an EAO. 

MC is my decentest chance of maximizing ETG. And it is not really out
of my scope I think, although my personal fit might say otherwise. The
personal fit factors in a ton of uncertainity and path that I have
chosen i.e., an MBA without scholarship sounds unimaginable. In case
it is not the cut for me, then with the GREATEST CC (5 stars on 80k) I
should be able to pick up my shit and do other things. But, the other
best way to create impact is by working at an EAO. *My uncertainity is
whether I am allowed to work at an EAO*.

<!-- MC in EAO OK/NOK: mail rob now -->

Given 6 months more, my personal fit estimate would have improved
because, that is how long I plan to take to prepare for GMAT and give
a score. By then I can make a better decision to move out to DS byt
year 28- whats in another few months. It seems like I should be able
to pick up DS with a delay of 6 months. I don't see it as a problem.

I assume the impact due to an MBA not in any of the top 3 or without
a scholarship as shit. I don't consider the career.

maybe... <!-- try to evaluate a MC without scholarship and  -->


**Impact based**

I don't think I can already start working in an EAO as I might need
some special skills, or do other things to get attention of people in
the community before I apply for a job, but never the less, based on


**Best choice overall**

DS in the beginning and moving to opportunities in DW seems to be the
best option with decent CC ([4/5](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) according to 80k) and decent
possibilities to DW ([3/5](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) according to 80k). However, because of
the skills, I see decent chances of moving to an EAO in some
years. There by gaining sufficient flexible CC and capabilities and
credentials to move to be worthy of a top EAO. 

By this I mean for the next 5 years, I will work my ass off and
understand and build my skills in programming and statistics and
writing. This will allow me to improve my scene in the 80k community
and join as an analyst, or writer, researcher based on DATA. Critical
thinking is the main think, solving problems is the other part of it. 

At this point I say, why won't I be offered a job in EAO, taking into
account why I am doing what I doing.

#### Elimination of the obvious

I have the numbers that I need and can already make a decision. Just
choose the highest number and I should be good right? Well there is
uncertainity in the numbers and I want to take it slow and start by
first removing the obvious ones based on reasoning and looking at the
numbers.

**CC wise**

DE for DW is a no go, has the lowest cc rating. One can argue that
once you get into and EAO, you will do great things and with the time
that DE in NL offers I can pretty much build whatever skill I want.

The point is the EAO's primarily require organizational capabilities,
research capabilities, writing capabilities, DS, programming, as far
as I know. But DE seems to offer none of this. Staying in DE and
becoming great at it and moving to a start up can be an option, but we
know how low probability that is.

<!-- What do EAO's actually require skills wise -->

So over all, for the above reasons it seems like a weak choice, but an
obvious other option is to do DS instead and it seems to beat the DE
for DW instantly as it gives you several opportunities to become
capable for EAO, wiht programming and statistics info. Everything
thing that you do at work, is counting towards the 10k hours unlike in
DE where the work at an EAO is almost orthogonal.

**Support conditions wise**

SC wise it appears that IB is a sure reject. I am really afraid of the
long hours and the tales of horror, lack of excitement in job. Which
is why I think it is a poor fit SC wise even for me. SC, I
gather/understand/guess that it is better even with MC. With hours
being reasonable.

**Total wise**

An Econ Phd can contribute moderately towards impact using ETG and
Advocacy. But, the one that has most impact is when an Econ Phd can
just save too many lives by being at the right place and at the right
moment. The thing is people look at Econ people with respect regarding
things they say, and this makes them very valuable in the field of
policy. 

An Econ PhD however with such a chance of getting this opportunity of
potentially adding benefits to a few millions of lives seems mighty
low as factored in the profile on Econ PhD. To add further, the
estimated impact was calculated to be lesser than EAO impact. Based on
my source who is an Econ PhD from the top 5 universities and got a job
in the government, I think it is wise to let this rare chance in
combination with an Econ PhD slide. 

Despite with the scope of causing maximum impact ever, the chances of
succeeding are really really low for now. 

However, in the later stages of my life working for a startup or
co-founding a startup should definitely be considered, considering the
impact. With a year or 2 of effort, we can better estimate the success
of the startup (say you get accepted into Ycombinator). Even to
attempt startups I need some proper CC, having worked a few years,
which I can use to add value.

<!-- I am afraid that I give more probability to something that is far
--> <!-- away, I seem to be more optimistic about scenario that is -->
<!-- more far away-->

As a sanity check, all the ones eliminated until now, seem to be on
the bottom of the list, when organized based on the total awarded to
each independent career path.

#### Comparing EAO vs DS

Comparing working now at an EAO and taking up DS now, I interpret the
advice from 80k as 'take up DS now'.

> If you are still early in your career, then it’s best to place greater
> importance on career capital than on role impact, as you’re likely to
> be able to find plenty of good opportunities to invest in yourself. If
> you’re late in your career, place less importance on career capital
> and more on making an impact now. That said, the amount of weight to
> put on career capital can also depend on which problems you want to
> work on. See more. 

I anyways need skills, which I need to spend time on. By the looks of
it, statistics, organizational etc... Maybe it may workout that after
one year I should move to EAO. But for now, I don't think EAO is the
right place for me yet.

The CC at an EAO is not really great with respect to getting training
or assistance from experienced people. The DS track followed by
working at an EAO at some point in life seems better than the EAO
track right away based on the advice of 80k-hours.

#### Comparing Econ Phd without the rare chance vs DS

An Econ Phd although hyped greatly by 80k-hours due to its advocacy
potential and possible impact and CC, it still seems to be a not so
great fit. Impact wise I claim an Econ Phd without the rare chance can
save 550 lives @ 29% personal fit. Where as a job at an EAO can save
>970 lives @ 41% personal fit.

It appears that EAO is the place to be and not an Econ PhD. As seen
above though, we want to start with something else (say DS) before we
move to an EAO. By extension then 'DS for DW' beats Econ PhD. 

#### DS vs MC (becoming partner)

MC along with becoming a partner is an incredible opportunity for
ETG. However the personal fit of 1.3% is really low for something with
a potential to save >1200 lives over ones life time. It appears that
it would be better to bet on EAO instead. As the >1200 lives is
dependent on several stages of the career over the next 25 years. It's
not like you can work it out a little and figure out much better
estimates of the personal fit. A personal fit of of 57% is required
for it to match the 'total' of a job at an EAO. With 1 years effort I
can know if I got scholarship in top 20. I would still be at a
personal fit of 25% and far from competing with 'working at an EAO'.

Although an MC is great in CC, I am not sure how it translates when I
would like to work for an EAO. In any case based on the personal fit
(i.e., probability of success) a DS would still beat an MC as the
number of lives saved has been assumed to be the same when working at
an EAO. 

At this moment it appears that MC of any form is not favourable even
with a few years of going further with the career due to the large
uncertainity and seemingly better option of 'DS for DW'. And as said
earlier, even if I spent time to see how far I get with 

So becoming partner is far fetched. Even if I went as far as finishing
my MBA successfully, my other options now are to work for some
organization (with an impact of 700 lives) or join an EAO (with an
impact of >970 lives). I am not sure why I would go with any of these
two options as DS with an EAO track seems more possible with similar
impact levels. 

There by it appears that MC is not worth pursuing just for the CC
alone, as impact estimated along with the personal fit, can be
obtained by other means with much more confidence.

#### Eliminating 

Having eliminated Starting up, Econ Phd with rare chance and IB, I see
that MC all variations of an MC career at low in the table.

This I think is mainly due to the personal fit. For example, becoming
a partner at a top agency is going to be really hard, even for the top
brains, and I estimated that probability to be 1%. Even if you save
1000 lives, it is still not the right move for you, as the net result
is looked at `0.01x1000=10 lives`

Getting an MC is so hard already that the even if there are back up
options, the personal fit is still low. This does not make any more
sense and hence until the personal fit is revised this does not seem
to make sense. 

Also, 



### Questions to Ram

1. Can I multiply prolties? Is there a better way to do this while
   comparing different options

So I am attempting to estimate which career is my best fit. In order
to do that I look at the chances of an event A, B to G. I multiply all
of these chances to get my personal fit.

The problem is though, with every career, my events are quite
different and the number of events also are different.

Also, the more number of events I have my personal fit automatically
goes down big time. 80% probabilities in 2 events will give me a very
bad personal fit of 64%.

Can you comment on if this is the way of the world or can I do better?

**Answer**
Ram suggests to use atleast the same number of events for each case.

2. What is the best way to estimate lifetime salary.

My typical approach is assume a salary growth of 4% an inflation of 2%
and 10% increase every 5 years and take it all the way till I am 70.

By doing this my estimate really large salaries when I am say 70. I am
afraid it is realistic. So for example, my current salary is 40k/year,
I claim it to become 362k/year when I am 70.

Sometimes I really know what the salary is going to be at a certain
level and then I use that directly, say in the case of Management
Consulting.

Is there a better approach? Your thoughts on what I can do better and
what I am doing wrong.

**Answer:**
Above 45 the rise in salary cannot be as much as 4%. 

3. While evaluating careers. 

lets take MBA track with becoming partner, leaving Mc after 5 years or
do something else.

While estimating the P of each of this, the P of MBA multiplies.

I look at it like independent tracks, but in reality they are backup
options, which I will take up based on how they pan out.

How can I caliculate resulting number of balls I can buy?

## Reflection

Work at a growing organization

Pursue certain graduate studies

Develop valuable transferable skill

Do what contributes to build career capital


Blockchain

- Summary of the whole thing.
- compare main careers
- Look at things like startup to aid or increase CC in tech only
- There seems to be a possibility of being more than one.

#### IB

[Rubin and Archer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ibMt0kQiw)were analysts quit IB for the following reasons:

- Despite putting 80-100 hrs/ week they still had to kiss ass,
  sometimes it doesn't make 
  
- Exit options are good apparently

- Mundane, not really, mainly ppts.

- Work goes unnoticed if kissing ass is not done 

- pretend to do work, when there is no work

- Very competitive

- Can learn the finance skills in 6 months.

- analyst to associate almost needs in MBA go in private equity and
  hedge funds (500k$)
  
- MBA for higher ups anyway most people.

- The skills you learn in IB can be got within 6 months (finanacial modelling), you don't
  really need to spend years working here to gain the skills
  
- Pure skills might be more freaking valuable or business skills that
  will allow you to scale a company from the ground up
 
- POlitics Bonus... 

- Pretend to do work... 

- Whether they like you are not. Unhealthy!

- They might not use your work everything you sacrificed. 

- He missed his cousins wedding and they still took the name out of
the book he made.

- If you focus on Statups and gaining crazy skill, then you will get
equity. and a fulfilling career. Stick to this part of the game.

----- 

What is IB?

Supporting companies that do mergers. Nothing sexy. As analysts
support the bbuying selling of companies, raising capital etc...

What do they do Day to Day?

There is an organizational schematic. The associate will drop at 7pm
in the evening a task of making 100 pages of document within the next
morning with good graphs and stuff that the higher ups can deal with.

Do market research, projections on excel what the company can
	buy... they present the ppt and engage as advisor. 1-2 months
	
Is IB fun?

Everybody is super excited. 100 hrs a week, not working on models
every week, lot of politics, youre even changing font colors on
things.

Lot of analysts use IB as a stepping stone finance and the corporate
world... exit opportunities. Hedge funds and private equity after 3
years. I am not sure I am 

21 years-  80-90k base ...signing bonus 10k ... bonus at the end of
the year...  75% to 100% of annual salary. 150 to 200 k ... By the 3rd
year you could make 250k . 150k easily @ 22 years. 100 hrs a week.


Exit opportunities: 

looks good on the resume.... good for MBA to exit to


Avg day: 8 to 9 am start.. 3-4 deals... need ppt by 3pm.. do
stuff... models draft by 2pm... follow up work for to other
things...until 7 pm. 

After that... you sometimes have to work until 2am and even drop off
the stuff at your MD's house. if you go to sleep at 6 am you are still
expected to come back to work at 10am. (get out of here)

Doesn't happen everyday, but it does happen. NO Weekends

168 hrs - 100 hrs work -40 hrs sleep = 28 hrs!

They have breaking into startups.

## Who earns the most

People in management law or Finance


## Consultant

X-BCG employee is glamourous?



## MBA

There are couple of things one can do after an MBA, such as management
consulting, Investment Banking Private Equity, Hedge Funds, Trading. 

I barely have a clue of what each of this is. 

In [this post](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/152549/working-for-mckinsey-bain-and-boston-consulting-vs-goldman-jpm-and-morgan-stanley) the difference between an IB'er and an MC't is
seen.

> capital for individuals and organizations, according to one
> definition. Investment bankers (i-bankers, or just “bankers”) give

>A management consultant (MC) provides expert advice to businesses on

>to create strategies to help companies make a turnaround. They look
>at what their client companies have been doing and suggest what they
>can do to perform better. MCs deal with different types of problems

>how to improve its product delivery or advise HR people how to create
>a new health plan for employees.-[MBAcrystalball](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2017/12/18/investment-banking-vs-management-consulting/)

It is clear from the above that one majors in Finance and the other
just in about anything to help a company get back or improve. MC's are
generally generalists, but somehow in the end are working for a
particular type of industry. 

Job satisfaction is expected to be better in MC than in IB, and the
hours are not that bad as in IB. Sometimes we work weekends, sometimes
not. IB in addition to all this shit, needs Facetime and 

Pay in MC is about 30-50% of an IB'er.

Pay in MC is detailed [here](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/nl-en/246284/work-in-management-consulting-how-much-you-will-make-at-mckinsey-bcg-and-bain). It appears that at Mckinsey one
earned in the year of 2017 an average salary of 140k. Which basically
a high performing engineer in apple can doing DS. [80k says a similar
salary for an associate as well (80 to 170k)](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/reports/management-consulting/)

**PE** is usually seen as an exit opportunity for IB. I googled what
it is and found some finance jargon and I leave it at that. PE can be
as bad as IB in terms of hours clocked or not depending on somethings,
but the pay gets even higher than in IB is my understanding according
to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ibMt0kQiw). People usually work for a few years in IB and then
move on to PE. PE apparently has more interesting work. Hours are
better when deals are not being made. But if in the middle of the deal
16 hours. But PE hours for juniors might still be punishingly
hard. Pay is same apparently according to [this source](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/nl-en/178146/honest-account-working-promised-land-private-equity), but
somehow the environment is better and chances of a burn out are
less. The hours still look bad according to this [quora post](https://www.quora.com/Whats-it-like-to-work-in-private-equity).

**Hedge funds**

 So you start at a company
and based on the amount of success you add, you get a corresponding
compensation. So in the beginning years it is not really high as you
need time to learn the tricks of the game. 

>We found that junior traders typically earn $300k – $3m per year, and
>it’s possible to reach these roles in 4 – 8 years. Senior portfolio
>managers can easily earn over $10m per year,-[80khours-hedgefunds](https://80000hours.org/2017/05/how-much-do-hedge-fund-traders-earn/)

- Money is crazy. 
- Hours are not as bad as in IB (50-60hrs). Apparently as the job
  revolves around capital markets and market closes.

As pleasant as that may sound, a brief view of what happens as [shown
here](http://www.lifeonthebuyside.com/buy-side-analyst-good-bad-day/) wants you to get away from this as well. I cannot deal with
these things knowingly that they will happen some time. I am not cut
out for this, I think. I have hated it always and I would liek to add
value in a different way.

In all of these programs it is to be understood that there is crazy
competition and you need to be the best of the best. Also there is the
possibility of market crashing affecting you. With all the stress I
doubt I will be able to eat sometimes, or go to the gym even.

#### chances hedge fund
Earnings need to be corrected for chances of leaving a job to more
operational roles, future prospects of industry and personal fit.

## Economics Phd

Non quantitative background would need additional training. Being a
ME, I am not sure what I need.

165+ in GRE is definitely achievable with some training. 


### Personal fit

I don't know how much of a fit it is. So I am trying to estimate my
fit..

In [here (80k non-quants bc help)](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/) I find that it is rather hard to
get an Economics PhD, if we haven't done MATH or ECONOMICS. Atlest
that the switch wont be straightforward. 

Although I am in Engineering, the switch we are looking according to
the link above seems to be 1-3 years, i.e, doing a transition course
and then a masters and gathering up some decent references and then
trying to get a PhD.

I think it makes sense to consider what happened. It appears that
University of Florida (UF) is ranked 105 in 2015, the year I had
joined and TU delft is ranked 17 for mechanical engineering according
to [here](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2015/engineering-mechanical). Checking on another site informs me that TU delft is
fucking ranked 18. Get out of here!

That is going for me to say that I have actually been studying here
instead of in the US. 

The credentials that got me here in Mehanical engineering

Although I do see really fucking stupid people overall in TUDELFt,
unfortunately even in material science. People who are so stupider
than me. Who basically studied shit in their bachelors and yet got
admitted to rank 18 university. 

To further comment about TU delft. I see that, even in my batch, there
were some really intelligent people or rather, people who have done
some realted work on a subject before, but I could match their
intelligence by putting in more hours than they did with their social
life. 

The master that I joined also had one really dumb person, who somehow
managed to finish it. My problem is TU Delft although a credential
doens't reflect my capability. Although, I would say I will be inthe
80% of my class. mostly. I am not very dumb or anything, and towards
the 2nd year, I also earned quite some >9s in my subjects in subjects
that had a lot of math involved, also dynamics and the like. This I
can highlight for the team.

Coming back I cannot claim crazy references to get an eco phd. I
suspect I have better references now, example, Rixen, Matthijs from TU
Munich and Tu delft, and maybe Sandipan or Palram from IIT. Mostly I
should just do some economics course and score highly there say even
on course era or something. I need to get evaluated how good I could
be to get an Eco Phd from then on.

I think speaking to an Eco Phd guy or looking at the two guides I have
in front of me, shed more light.

But according to [ here (person from non-quants background)](https://80000hours.org/2015/06/advice-on-entering-a-us-economics-phd-from-the-uk-with-a-non-quantitative-background/),

Sounds like a 60% chance at best.

a) I don't have the money now to do a diploma 
b) If even then you "only have a shot", its not that good of a bet to
be placed.

Apparently a lot of harvard graduates have done a masters and then a
year of work in research to obtain a stellar reference, that gets them
some place good. 

[Certainity of finding soe job exists for sure](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html) according to Noah

My uncertainity lies in how do you define good?

How much time I need to prep for an eco master?

Frankly speaking Harvard is obviously not for me.




### How much good can you do?

[Here is one low probability scenario](http://allegedwisdom.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-story-of-lucky-economist.html) working in the US federeal
Government agency. 

The article shows a true EA't who clearly looked at numbers and did
some amazing things. He seems very much in touch with reality, seems
to truly understand the value of one goddamn human life. So fucking
Inspiring. Wow. 

Coming back to actual impact, the author claims that a 20 year career
high of the person who interviewed him to be: raising some questions
during a meeting that probably has saved farmers from tens of millions
of dollars, in total. Thats it.

And probably nothing to this level will ever happen again.

>This is what you can expect your direct impact to be as an agency
>economist: find ways to save people money and make life a little less
>difficult for them, while still accomplishing the mission of the
>agency. This is a good life and a noble calling, for those who think
>about efficiency and the big picture, and it is unreasonable to
>expect more.

The author also shared his own stories in this regard wherein he ended
up with saving an estimated 400 lives (somehow only). Plus he also
earns more than 100k and is able to donate 30k, saving atleast 10k
people .

The key points to remember are:

>The main message of this story is that the direct impact of a
>government economist is extremely high-variance. Most of the time,
>you will do nothing to make the world better. Occasionally, you will
>do something that prevents a few million dollars from being
>wasted. And if you get very very lucky, you might do something that
>saves the statistical equivalent of hundreds of lives.

### Am I good enough?

- High grade (min. 3.5+)

Based on [authority conversion of dutch score to US](https://www.studyinholland.nl/documentation/grading-systems-in-the-netherlands-the-united-states-and-the-united-kingdom.pdf) and wiki's [internal
US conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States), I think my grade is 4.0/4.0. [Another source](https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/764/how-are-grades-different-in-the-netherlands-compared-to-the-us.html)
suggests that my grade 3.75. Both seems to be decent. 

- I will work hard on quants and try to obtain 165+ in GRE

I think I can. But Verbal I have no control over.

- Good reference letters

This is the thing that I have not much idea about.

  
#### Working @ effective altruism organizations

**Basic qualifications**

>If you’re a highly self-motivated individual who cares deeply about
>the ideas of effective altruism, we think it’s one of the
>highest-impact things you can do with your career.

>If you’re a good fit for one of the positions, and believe in the
>ideas of effective altruism, we think that working at an EA
>organisation is one of the highest-impact things you can do with your
>career.

[Why?](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#why-is-working-at-an-ea-organisation-high-impact)

Types of roles
- research 
- marketing and outreach
- product management
- operations
- Management

>Meet the leaders of the organisations by attending EAG
>conferences. Demonstrate your fit by commenting on organisations’
>blogs, volunteering at EA Global conferences, helping to run local EA
>groups, and doing freelance work and internships. 

>If you’re a good fit for one of the positions, and believe in the
>ideas of effective altruism, we think that working at an EA
>organisation is one of the highest-impact things you can do with your
>career.


But won’t I be replaceable? 

>Some people worry that since a lot of people want to work at
>effective altruist organisations, if you don’t take a job, someone
>else who’s capable will do it, so you won’t have much impact. They
>also often think that they should earn to give instead – take a high
>earning job and donate to these organisations, since their donations
>won’t be replaceable.

Exactly what I was thinking.

**Impact**

>To get a sense of how much value you create by working at an EA
>organisation, we asked the organisations how much funding they would
>have traded for their most recent hire. They gave an average of
>$126,000 – $505,000 and a median of $77,000 – $307,000 per year.4
>Some of the organisations gave figures as high as $1m. There is
>incentive to inflate these figures in order to attract hires,5 but it
>at least suggests that these hires are expected to have a major
>positive impact on the organisation.

>This is substantially more than most people could donate, even if
>they work in one of the highest-paying industries. This suggests that
>if you could get one of these jobs, your personal fit is similar to
>other recent hires, and you think these organisations are effective,
>it would be better to do that than to earn to give.



## Todo

copy 80k ranking in the samel excel, 

look at all comments and propose actions

re-edit english and non-repeatability of text of the whole 14k essay.

Continue excel to detail out more info like salary, etc... etc..

Discuss with Ram ... estimating prolties like when you add more and
more, the value become sless.!

Where can I come in with my innovation?

Where can I be most useful?
Because there are people already doing things, why should I go there,
when I do not know if I can add value to it. Earning to give I
understand, but direct work not sure.


- There are others to do these kind of things, what is your
  contribution then? 

<!-- Settling the debate of number of lives saved -->

<!-- Add? job security? -->

<!-- Growing old -->

<!-- >30 and learning -->

### Plan

  * [ ] repair one section by section and repair numbers or add
        uncertainity- from tomorrow already else it becomes one
        gigantic task
		
  * [x] check the thing with probabilities
  * [ ] Act on probabilities?
  * [ ] have a look at the comments and see if there is anything
        useful
  * [ ] [Career planning tool ](https://80000hours.org/career-planning-tool/)
  * [ ] [research decision tool](https://80000hours.org/career-decision/)
  * [ ] [investigate risk aversion](https://80000hours.org/career-decision/)
  
- [x] Make analysis of which is best?
- [ ] Most important is probability: having same events for diff prolties
- [x] XxCC = YxImpact; X? Y?
- [ ] 30 years 20 to 30 prime?  
- [ ] Speak to sivagagnam, praneeth burra regarding age issues
- [ ] risk aversion
- [ ] Plan ABZ
- [ ] fix the document for reading by others
- [ ] improving personal fits
- [ ] DS vs SE
- [ ] MC after scholarship working as a big shot ETG

Do an analysis based on the current results I have. Figure out your
uncertainties but don't act on them yet. Once we have done the
analysis, assuming v02-00 is right then we can kill it in other ways.

The other thing is there are some errors in the v02-00 document. As an
attempt at addressing the "flaw" of equating XxCC and YxImpact, how
about we first strip all those factors down and try to repair it or
your know get it on a scale of 1 to 10. EQUATING?

It's almost set what I want to do. Clean the essay first and then
focus on your uncertainities. Period. nothing else to do for
now. clean up website for others viewing


### ideas
	
What If I take another 6 months to evaluate by trying out some things
like economics, MBA etc... 

MEanwhile also write about persuation.

Did anyone ask you everyone asks you how your weekend was ? 

Godfordome, what about my goals?

## Rant

How do I want to make the excel sheet with all the numbers?

I think I should just keep Design Engineering earning to give, DEsign
engineering building skills to work in an NGO.

And when I talk about startups or working in startups after 5 years of
work around here, I can make contributions due to
DE,DS,MC, etc... Most likely I think they will be the same, but I will
do it there. OK?

That settles it.

- to give money either by starting up 
<!-- these numbers need justification, looks like they are pulled out -->
<!-- of someones ass. -->
	The probability of succeeding in starting up, seems to be dependent on:
	- Chance of having the vision to be a Y-combinator level startup and
          applying (5%)	  
	- chance of getting accepted in Y-combinator (2.5%)
	- Chance of that startup succeeding (25% based on current
      [Ycombinator list](https://yclist.com/) of 11 years)

17 year olds were affected much more by interference in learning than
were 9 or 12 year olds.

Quoting some scientist
https://www.fastcompany.com/3045424/what-it-takes-to-change-your-brains-patterns-after-age-25

In the above article they talk about how we can make new pathways when
we are young and that as we get old it will be harder. I doubt that I
am unable to learn something new say when I am 32. 

Granted it will slower than I can now due to the plasticity thingy,
granted there will be young people who are faster than me in
that, but I suppose I have laid down some foundation for it. By that I
mean it won't be completely new.

The thing I am worried about is about having enough time to learn it
and having opportunities to intern and then change job.

I am looking for an answer where people tell me "Don't try to learn
someting completely new at the age of 35" for example.
