### Rough max!

So I was recently watching spider man 2 and in the end there was a
scene where Peter Parker says to Mary Jane, "I can't be with you mary
jane, Spiderman will always have enemies and I cannot stop beingspiderman"


In another scene, he goes to maryjane and in person says to her that
he will e differnt and ... What else can he do, in the next scene he
is seen running fast and into the city in his suit


I was wathcing spiderman the other day and a thought struck me. Mary
jane accepted being engaged despite Peter Parker trying to talk to her
and get her a drink. She shoos him away and the only thing Peter
parker could do was to wear his suit and save crime. If he has a bad
day, if he got socially consumed all he could do is wear his suit and
save people. 

"I and you can never be, spiderman will always have enemies and I
cannot stop being spiderman." 

Even for us people, what can I do, whenever you are consumed in social
problems, when ever the girl you like doesn't repond? We should enrich
our lives and the way we can 


Anyways, I think of it like this. I will always have
problems. Persuation won't leave me alone. Motivation in the case of
saving lives will not feeling wise be always strong. When we have a
rough day when we realize we suck socially or when we feel bad for
something that is truly not important, but persuation doesn't leave
alone, I suspect like spiderman, we should just go to the one place we
call heaven. Writing or solving problems enriching our lives, instead
of worrying about it even more. Just like spiderman who does this
