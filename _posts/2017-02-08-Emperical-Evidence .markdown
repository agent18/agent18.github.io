What is Emperical Evidence? 
> It is the evidence based on, concerned with, or verifiable by observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic.

#### **Setting it up**

In Map vs Territory][mvt] we saw how wrong I have been in the past owing to the lack of sync with my belief and the reality. Namely I burnt 46000 euros. Hmmm, this can be costly.

 - "If only I bought a Benz, my life would start kicking ass"
My cousin in dubai gave me a first hand account about how he thought buying a Benz would start kicking ass. He said,"  The first month was nice, but after that I didn't feel a thing". You work all your life, you save money all your life and spend it with the hope that the ROI is going to be  killer. I am afraid this is not the reality. Novelty of Material things wears off, we get used to it.

 - "I think I can finish the work by today"
That was pretty much what I thought at the beginning of the day today, let alone all the other previous times that I don't have a proper account for. I didn't finish my work. Planning fallacy some say.

 - "Life will be great once I go to Netherlands"
Sure. 

 - "Life will be awesome once I have a girlfriend"
Are you saying people with girlfriends don't have problems anymore?

 - " Let me just to to fb for a few secs and I promise I will write like a bitch after those few seconds"
I fall for it every single time. 

 - and the classic, "I will lie on the bed for a few minutes and get back up and write like a bitch"

 - "I will wake up tomorrow morning and go to work early"
Never, I am just in time for the stand-up meeting at work every single day.

- One of my biggesst and worst ever , "I will chill today being friday. Tomorrow I wills start my work at 9 am. Period."
Right from about 10 months back to now, when I needed to wake up early and start work, I have invariably driftedd off, waking up late as fuck and cooking and then ending up startign writing at 4 or ssomething, adn yet every friday night I say to myself...s

- Despite the fact that people raise their defence every singe time you speak to them about the mistakes in his life!

My belief and reality are quite disconnected. I would like my belief and reality to be closer to each other, as sometimes it can turn out to be costly.

Yeah once in a while we may fall for this!No every single time

**Enter EE**
Emperical Evidence is a type of evidence that is deduced from observation or experience.

"My belly is swelling up even more, I must be becoming heavy by the day, I am talking in the order of 0,5 kg". But is it?
One might be better advised to use a weighing machine to record the data, and allow the reality to determine my fate.


Note regarding experience.

How do we fall for it?

I am currently eating healthy and I am on track of my fitness program! Where is the evidecne

It sounds right! Astrology

News ssites, fake news, opinions 

I think I understand

Masturbation is not right

AStrology and science

opinions, thing about it poitns, but the fact? ananth! and when there is no point arguing!



We have no idea where all we are fucking up. We need to be vigilant. But how and what can we do? Lets hope this post partially answers that.



Instead of beliveing that laurens is god why dont you seek the emperical eveidence!

#### **To be answered:**
What is EE? Why the fuck are we learning about it? What is it going to do for us? How do we fall for non EE? how does it solve the map vs territory problem.

What can EE do for you?

How can we procure EE? 

But how about things that are *not* empirical evidence? What do you forbid as not empirical? The "drink how much ever you want" example seemed a bit too made-up. What do people actually fall for? What seems convincing but actually isn't? What has troubled an Agent himself? Perhaps you could connect your good initial examples to your ideas - right now, they're standing alone.

In short, how does EE solve the M != T problem? What is the key constraint? Hint: Can you make stuff up? Another hint: Are there people out there making stuff up? How do we detect these kind of resources?
