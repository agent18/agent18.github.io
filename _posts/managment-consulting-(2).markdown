## What am I  unsure of?

1. Need for safety net?

My friend who did his MBA in Arkansa university (ranked 25 in the US),
got laid off and is expected to find a job within 2-3 months. He was
fired in an instant. He reached out to a couple of companies like
Unilever, American express, Zitter health insights etc... and they
informed him that they don't hire internationals. He attributed it to
H1B crisis created by Trump.

This is the case for someone who got a 730 in Gmat and an 80%
scholarship while studying, first job earns ~70k$ only (110k$ in
california probably). I am not really sure if he is the best
example. He also mentioned that everyone in the next year got full
scholarship in his school. But 730 is considered a very good score.

Another friend of mine is about to study in Cornell having worked a
few years in Deloitte in the US. He did a simple masters in management
and began his journey with Deloitte. He is about to pay 180k$ for his
education and is very confident to get a shit load of money moving
into finance or getting back to management consulting.

I don't believe I am 730 material, yet. It looks really unsafe for me
to venture out of NL with the possibility of leaving US empty handed
like my former friend's near fate. Even if I am as good as the former
friend, it leaves me at great risk of spending ~20k$ with the worst
case being, going back to India. I cannot imagine what I can do in
India, I suspect I can't do much with my skill sets of mechanical
engineering. 

I suspect I can pull my shit together and be the best version of
myself in India too. I suspect my impact would be better just being in
NL instead of india. 

If Ultimately I am looking to gain skills to lead, and to a foundation
to make shit loads of money (investment banking), I suspect I could
still do it here in NL. I could apply for a masters here. And attempt
going to the US by showing some tangible credentials? Although I have
not many examples, of people who have done it, my cousin got a green
card from India, by being really good at his shit, and of course a
whole load of luck. 

The Risk of going to the US to study and find a job and settle there
without being able to fall back in NL seems not really rock solid. The
pit falls of just staying in NL or waiting for a citizenship before
taking the leap, seem to be minor, considering that I can do an MBA here
for example, gain the same skills here, and migrate based on potential
at a much much later date.

In case I immediately attempt to go to US but then fail at finding a
job or I get laid off, then I am not sure what future lies for me in
India. I could still be able to make somthing work I guess, as I am
ultimately looking to gain skill and do direct work. With the possible
support from 80k hrs, once I have the respectable credentials, then
maybe there are still possibilities.


2. Why do an MBA?

It is a good platform to go to the US. It is a good platform to pursue
things like management consulting, finance or investment banking.

There seem to be quite some advacntages to moving to the US to find a
job. I am afraid it is harder to get a job from here directly in the
US, unless I am at the peak of my career. For starters in the
industry, people who are in the US, seem to have the access to
resources there and the visa for companies to try you for a few
years is what I am told. I am not hopeful about Management consulting
for sure, with my current skill set.

One last thing to consider would be that cryonics is currently sharp
only in the US, and seems to be taking its sweet time to catch up in
Europe.

P.S

Heavy procrastination. Barely wrote for 45 mins. After another 30 mins
of procrastination, I got in the groove and did some decent writing
for ~45 mins. Peace
