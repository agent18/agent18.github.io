## Preface

This post was written two days back. I received a lot of comments. I would like to address those comments in this time and also make an edit.

Quite some BLUNDERS I have made. I read the comment twice, didnt seem like a big deal. And then went back to edit the post and then it slowly hit me. But glad it is being brought to the surface. I would like the audien to please let me know if I have understood it right this time.

## Setting it up


Some of us would like to know what we are supposed to do in life, the goal, the purpose, the meaning of life. Assuming there is something as a goal, how do we determine it? Where do we find it? 

There needn't be a purpose, meaning or goal in life. But some of us would like to know if there is a meaning to life, and what it is and try to do it. 

Why should we want know what we are supposed to do in life? 
No idea!

Moving on... Assuming that there is a purpose, a goal or a meaning to life, what can it be? and where can we find it?

## The solution in a box

Lets say there is a box it has the ultimate solution to your question. Lets also say, I obtained it from the greatest rational people in this world, who believe this is it. This is the goal. 

Now Open it, read it, and do it.

#### OPEN it read it 

What if it says "watch why this kolaveri again and agian"

What if it says "There is no meaning to life, just do random things"

What if it says "go kill a baby; that is the solution to your life"

Waht if it says "kill your parents and then kill yourself"

Mind you, it has what you should be doing in life. 


#### Do it.

If it is what it is, then shouldn't you be doing it?

_But can you?_

Imagining myself in a forest where there is no one, and knowing for sure that I will not get caught at any cost in the hands of the police, I still cant go ahead with killing the baby. 

_What if I hand you a red pill, a pill that can change you forever such that you can kill babies is the red pill._

NO.

_Knowing that your purpose is to kill babies and that a red pill can change your thought process from not killing, to killing right away. Can you now?_

I cant.

~~ _What if it is backed by world renouned scientists, rational god men, studies and heavy research. What if scientists claim emperical evidence says that this is it, go kill babies._ _Shouldnt you be killing babies by now. Why arent you killing them, even in a forest scenario._

I cant. ~~ This sentence is deleted.

_Why not!!!_

I just fucking cant. It fucking pains. My feelings bars are beyond full and are not allowing me to go through with it, come what may. Hell, not even if my life were at threatenment. I cannot kill a fucking baby, say taking a knife and stabbing it. GOSH NO.

_But wait a minute... Didnt we see in Map vs Territory that your reactions(feelings) are based on psuedo reality (MAP) and not the actual reality (territory)?_

Yes we did


## Bringing it to an end

You are a computer program. The computer program has its agenda. The code already contains what is important and what is not. The code already contains that we should not kill babies, more lives saved the better etc... The code, unforunately, due to lack of resources computes the map of the territory using H and B. But the code already contains what we should do, in other words, it contains the pupose, the solution, the meaning and everything. In other words the solution is inside the head.

Yes our H and B computed something but we can improve upon the result and hence the map, by using EE. Figuring out what we actually want using EE.

The only thing that will take us to the reality is EE. And it is this uncovering of the actual territory is what decides what we should do.

## Concusion for now:

So, Should we kill a baby if EE says so. Even if feelings are shooting above the roof... 

YES! YES! YES!

Why does what the code wants important and not what H and B claims?// Will be answered later

It appears that the solution is inside the head. What we need to do is programmed in us. We need to discover it. The only thing that can take us to reality is EE.

Rant:
Its hard. We talked about it and its quite wague, especially with the time that elapsed. My notes helping a little. 
Logic fails us in this world. Feelings do not work. The only way you can actually know something is by rigourous experiments and studies or in other words EE. I heard from you so many things. Now all I am trying to do is make a coherent version out of it. And you are helping my understanding with those powerful questions. As I write this and read your comments again and again, I 'feel' that these questions are only there to push me. Initially I came to this rant section to tell you that, you are pushing too much, you are expecting too much from me. A more patient look, after attmepting to blow off some steam, shows the comments in a different light. I guess it was all the frustration of not being able to make  a good post. I guess it is for me to understand now that I cant make a "good post". That is not the goal. The goal is to crush your brain. the goal is understand. The goal is to think clearly. 

Amen.

## List of surprising insights

I read the website of an STM again. 
You are the solution... I felt a moment like when I felt while handling labels. Until this point I didnt see ti as that. Looking at them as tweo different objects feels like a traffic jam in the brain. // More investigation later.

what to do not how to do?// From the comments from the revious post.

The solution is not singular stop saying solution... I was saying solution and it restricted my imagination, when in reality it is solutions. example getting 100k is better than 1k. Saving 10 lives is better than 1. // More investiagation report later.

When I am doing hard thinking that is when I was able to see the above points listed in this section. Things that I took for granted. The day I was about to write I thought I knew the solution inside my head. Surprise.... writing and feedback 1 thinking 0

The rant on what the actual current goal was. Measuring success by the means and not the end.

P.S

Refer the main article I referred here.
http://pradeep90.github.io/The-Solution-in-your-Head.html

It would be great to see more elaboration in that post as well. Will post comments.

Further editions will have more corrections. Still first draft material.
