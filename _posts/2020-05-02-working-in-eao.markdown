**Entry question**: Is it worth it to get an "EA job"? What about
replaceability? What are your chances of getting it?

## Is it worth it if you get an EA job? 

What sorts of impact can you have?

**Longtermism**

[42 people in OpenPhil](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team) move over 100million in 2018. On average
they are moving about 2.38m<span>$</span>. Expected to be "much less",
considering. This 2.38m could have "much larger" effects aka save
"many many lives". They would have used some cost-effectiveness
estimate I assume and hence all the different grants potential should
be equal per dollar spent in saving lives for example. That is set.

OPP is "just advising" where money should go to. There are donors of
the "fund", then there are OPP's researchers who say where the money
should go, and then there are the people who work on the grants. 

What is the imapact someone has? So a grant could end up saving say 1k
lives. This 1k has to be split among all the people who worked to make
it happen I think. But it can be imagined that I could be in the far
end of the chain and make or break 1k lives. This informs me that I
could take the credit for all 1k lives.

Impact shall be defined as net lives saved when OPP existed - net
lives saved when OPP vanished. Poof!

If my existence made or broke the saving of 1k lives, then I am
responsible for the lives of 1k lives. What about the people before?
Again, if they were there or not there what would happen? If donros
were there and not there, if OPP was there and not there, if the grant
players were there and not there? If any part of the chain fell then
we would not be able to save those 1k lives. So all three could seem
to be essential. It would be naive to assume that opp can thus take
all the impact because its existence makes or breaks the chain. Cause,
the same could be said about the grant users and then donors. 

Now for some more reality. The grant makers have 100m and decide to do
something good. OPP comes in does some research and dedicates it to
say AMF. Leading to save 1k lives. Then impact is shared by 


There are somethings missing such as contribution of the donor,
contribution of the people ahead in line otherwise we would be double
counting.

Then there is the counterfactual impact which in total could decrease
the actual impact from 2.38m<span>$</span>. A first year researcher in
GiveWell is expected to have 10% of co-founder impact and GiveWell
seemed to have 9 co-founder equivalents in 2015. 

Say 30% counterfactual impact by the org = 714k. Depending on how
replaceable the job is and if there are or not spillover effects, this
could be far lower. 

I think because I can ETG to the same fund, I think you can compare
dollars donated vs dollars moved by the org.

From the money I donate only 30% impact is attributed to me. Just
because I donate 150k doesn't mean I get all value for that associated
to me. Imagine the case where everyone is not replaceable. A, B, C
need to cooperate to save 1000 lives. If either A, B & C are missing,
you save 0 lives. Even if B and C are replaceable, then does it mean
that A is credited with 1k lives? I am not sure. 


Impact of something = Impact by A + B + C 

global health and poverty

AEA

These discussions are already had in the past... [Halstead](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EP8x3vHRQJP57TjFL/the-counterfactual-impact-of-agents-acting-in-concert),
[Joey](https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/fnBnEiwged7y5vQFf/triple-counting-impact-in-ea?hide-nav-bars=true) etc... There are two distinctions. Which scenario we
consider.

Scenario 1:  OPP, donors and ACE exist

counterfactual: OPP doens't, donors and ACE exist.

This results in the case of 0 replaceability, that OPP gets all the
points.

The "paradox" is that there seems to be double counting or triple
counting in the case that all three actors are induvidually
irreplaceable. So what is happening? 


So the counterfactual impact of all three acting is X. The
counterfactual impact of each of them acting is also X. The questions
comes into consideration when we see that couterfactual of A B
and C added doesn't give the counter factual of ABC taken together. Why
should they.

> At 80,000 Hours, we rarely claim more than 30% of the impact of an
> event or plan change, --- [Benji todd](https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/fnBnEiwged7y5vQFf/triple-counting-impact-in-ea?hide-nav-bars=true)

In summary, 80khours claims 30% counterfactual impact for plan change

Scenario: plan change in the presence of 80khours

Counterfactual: plan change in the absence of 80khours

But there is no org like 80khours but people could have come to the
conclusion themselves. so they say they take 30%.

So does this mean the actual performer only gets 70% of his success?

There are three factors: each gets 33%. Next whether B existed or not
there would be something the donors would have donated to something in
its absence, say not that impactful. In that case we are talking about 33%x30%xImpact.


This is 235k (accounting for replaceability). Now if I further account
to more of the replaceability?what happens? Especially in this insane market.

## Replaceability

go into this.

How replaceable are you?

Nowadays its pretty competitive with "not-enough jobs". OPP reporting
that there were hundreds of good people. Hiring in EA jobs are pretty
tight. I am not going to be getting any policy jobs.  Applications has
increased from 200 the previous year to 2000 for CE for 15 positions.

the existing replaceability would be at 90% or greater as I am informed
by some people. And because of the crazy number of people and the
limited number of jobs, its really competitive and looking at the
current pool apparently the top person is only 10% better and what
happens to the rest? They try to find other jobs. I have no way of
knowing, but hearing from people like Peter, it appears that they have
to be sent away. 

I am assuming that they are making very little impact. As ETG is only
great I think if one is in California in software or in new york in
banking. Otherwise I think it's going to be that pathetic number of
4-10k max. I think this is a pointless task... 

And I think you are 90% replaceable. And the next person you replace
probably gets in but not there after. 

My biggest fear is not amounting to anything. 

I am afraid there are not many jobs that I can do (Data science, GR,
). Things like program manager, I don't even know what I can do to
begin. Or I need a space to break in.  But that seems hard and quite
competitive. 

and also it is hard to know where I will fit. 

More and more I get the feeling that I should focus on becomin
really. Good. And statistics, writing, data science are the things I
want to get better in. I think these will help me. 


Always depressing. I don't have any clue how I can go from here.

so apping is pointless. I suck at research. Not convinced about impact
due to replaceability.

So see what is missing and go for it. Investigate if it is
replaceable? where I go from there is I don't know. becoming a program
manager seems far fetched...

But I remain unconvinced. how to do it is secondary. 

**What about spillover effects?**

## Chances of getting it

- Fear of not getting anything at all due to lack of jobs, 2k people
  for 15-20 positions is straight up insanity and wrong. 

- 
## Different positions I am considering

Management, running an EA, statistics related, generalist researcher,
data scientist


## Focusing on personal fit?



## Conclusion  
  
So pandian is doing crucial considerations research. So far I have
seen that working in DS can impact say 150k$ with 30% certainty of
pursuing such a path or going with 15k (maaaax) with for the rest
(i.e., working in NL). This results in 57.5k donations including
percentages.

This sounds really low.

**So I need to estimate something similar for EA side for one job? or
atleast look at previous estimations or guess-estimations from
people. Taking into account different forms of replaceability.**

Am inclined to choose a path now in NL with some form of
statistics. This way I could theoretically still pursue DS in L1 with
that limited chance. But if I gave my everything to pursue a career in
EA (so vague) researcher for ex then does it make sense? Or should I
already look to do something else like management... who are the
managers I know? What is their impact? How did they become managers?
Should i get a policy cedric? should I do that DEDP course which costs
me 1k$?

what about lack of opportunities? come back to statistics. What
happens 

so I need to perform this dual function of being good in statistics
and being good in "research", writing, critical thinking etc...

wow man this might not be that complicated. For now then pursue this
shit of ds degree, L1 route, atleast start with statistics, :( ML and
then simultaneously see if you can get a job in EA or what you need to
improve to get in EA in an Impact job and not a replaceable one. 

again you need to be great! not really serve a lot of people!!!!!!!

I think I am missing the whole point. I thought i needed to do
everything  in my power to save as many people as I can... Can I do
that in EA, What do I need to power myself with?

**Claims**: to be tested. I feel like I shoudl move to DS (keep my
options open)  and then pursue Ea type works pivotting. Even if I get
fucked then I can "always jump back".

can't believe I am landing with somehting that homie Peter said.


See what allows you to neglect the shit of certain paths. If it even
makes sense to pursue certain paths.
