## DALY's

https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/blog/what-are-dalys-and-are-they-a-good-metric


**Definition**: Disability Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) are a measure
of how many years of healthy life are lost due to an early death or a
debilitating condition.

In Italy I guess, choosing to not revive 80year olds could be the
following:

1. it is based on average life expectancy at birth. 

And the oldies would probably have much low life expectancy compared
to younger people.

2. Being older they don't have too many YLL's (Years of life lost).

For a blind man of 20 years old, and 80 years  his DALY would be:

YLD = 0.6 x 20 = 12 DALYs (aka number of years of healthy life lost)

YLL = 60 DALYs (not sure if it is multiplied for YLL)

For a healthy individual of 20 years old, then he would have 

60 DALYs

For an old person at 80, it would be:

0 DALYs


### Shorcomings of DALY

- Region inspecific

	Blind in nigeria and blind in NL
	
- Doesn't take into account non-health issues
  
    Social Osticism
	
- Number of small DALYS can add up to beat anything if you are a prioritarian.


## Time discounting

> There is a psychological phenomenon known as time

> a much smaller payment right now than they will in the future.


So, we should somehow prefer things now (e.g., money now), instead of
future as you could invest the money and there is a possibility you
will die in the coming one year or what ever...

You could spend half a day organizing your work space and it will give
benifits in the future but it has present cost.

We can produce the margin of error with 90% CI...

Margin of error increases with %

Probability of covering the true mean with the margin of error is also %
