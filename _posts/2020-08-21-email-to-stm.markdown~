Hello STM,

I don't see the point of working in a company now (whilst I could
potentially do other things: DP, blog, skills etc...). This whole
recent assignment took 2 full months and if I had more time I could
get it done faster or do other things in parallel such as learning DS
etc... All the work I am doing at the office is probably a waste as I
don't expect to be in Mech engineering forever. My work is just a
source of steady income for me.

## Permanent Residency, Citizenship and Work Protection

Company I am working at seems to be doing "good" (0 firings so far
unlike in 2008, and as we are in chip-making-industry, CEO assures that
we are still hot, and we are going on with business as usual).

I got permanent residence in Netherlands recently. This means that
even if I get fired, I don't have to leave the country in 3 months. I
can stay until 2025 (if I have the money for it)--when they review my
application to continue my Permanent Residence. If I leave the country
for more than 4 months PR is revoked. So it is either spending my
savings with PR, or going back to India and loosing the PR.

In any case am applying for Citizenship as well (so I have more
freedom with leaving the country and coming back when I want). Takes a
year to process.

## Number of days

Not loosing the PR is important. It's a great backup country to be in
(earnings wise and work-life-balance wise). Keeping the savings I got
till now (30k) is also important. I would like it for when times are
really bad to keep me alive for 18-20 months. Going to 0 days a week
would either jeopardize the PR or the savings (which I don't want for
the above reasons).

I am thinking of reducing the number of paid working days from 5 to 3
per week by the end of this month as it still keeps me in NL with just
enough income and I can sell such a move to my boss (it appears).

## Why are they allowing me to do it (mostly)?

I have some injuries in my pelvis (nothing serious) and shoulder which
does not allow me to excercise as much as I want. (Going to the doc
here. No worries.) I played this card to reduce work hours and already
got 4 working days as of now and I'll be pushing and they will mostly
give me 3 days a week by the end of the month.

*Disclaimer*: It is a permanent thing that I need to switch to 3 days
a week. If needed in the future ("when I feel better"), I can request
4 days a week and if budget allows they will try and make it happen.

## Cash Cash Money!

I have 30k in savings which will allow me to be 18-22 months unpaid
("runway") so far.

I want to go for option 3 below: 3 days of work with 1% donations. The
following will be the split roughly:

| opt. | Days/week | Gross/Net | Basic exp./yr | Donations/yr | Savings/yr |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| 1.   | 5         | 60k/40k   | 16.8k-19.2k   | 10% (6k)     | 12k        |
| 2.   | 3         | 36k/27k   | 16.8k-19.2k   | 10%  (3.6k)  | 4k         |
| 3.   | 3         | 36k/27k   | 16.8k-19.2k   | 1% (360)     | 7k         |

Expenses don't include vacation (luckily with corona I don't take
vacations to India or US), visa might come about (1k for citizenship),
and sudden expenses such as a laptop, phone or an EA conference in
London (1k atleast with visa etc...), or courses etc. I don't want to
dip into my savings for this.

**Regarding my parents:** My brother and sister-in-law are super well
off in California and my parents have enough cash to take care of
themselves. I have paid my parents some 15k-20k in the last three
years. I will pay them another 16k over time, which is what I promised
for the 50k they spent on my masters. Worst case I don't pay them. Not
like they are hounding me for cash. I just give when I have over 30k
euros from now on.

I told my parents that I am going to work one less day, and my brother
that I am going to focus on skills and am going to work 3 days a
week. All is good so far. 

## Plan/claims

So the plan is to work 24 hrs a week in the company and hopefully do
something like 34-40 hrs a week of "important stuff". Over the last 5
weeks I have averaged 22.4 hrs per week (3.2hrs per day). I expect the
change to add 7 to 14 hours. Let's see. I will try to hit 40 hrs with
3 days on work days and 6 hours on holidays (provided I don't have
work related to this citizenship in those weeks).

So what do I need from an STM?

Blessings. 1 year back I got his holiness' blessings to move to a
studio. I want that again, and potentially question if he thinks this
is the wrong move. As always there is not much time. I want to go back
to my boss and start putting pressure to change to 3 days a week
ASAFP. Waiting for your blessings Thalaiva. Can you reply within 2
days?

Thanks.
