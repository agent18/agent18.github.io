## EU 

**What is EU blue card?**

Something that allows you to accumalate time while working in
different member states, so that in the end you can get a
PR/Citizenship. 

>The blue card is an approved EU-wide resident permit allowing high
>talented non-EU residents to work and live in any nation within the
>European Union, barring Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom,
>which are not subject to the proposal.

One can work in the EU. But, while moving from one member state to the
other, [one has to pay money and apply for an RP costing 909 Euros,
	for example, in the Netherland](https://ind.nl/en/work/Pages/EU-blue-card-holder.aspx), in order to work here. One does
not need to be in Europe to apply for the blue card.

>Unemployment for highly-qualified workers may not last longer than 3 consecutive months. 

This PERMIT  seems to be not for simple people who finished a degree and
looking to start their career. This is for the real deal, people with
good amount of experience.

**Important requirements**

  * [x] Non-EU citizenship
  * [x] Educated or professionally experienced
  * [x] Work contract or binding job offer 
  [Official-source](https://www.apply.eu/BlueCard/)

  * [x] Earn a minimum of 4.908 euros gross per month for Netherlands
        in the contract - [iamexpat](https://www.iamexpat.nl/career/employment-news/eu-blue-card-skilled-migrants-your-questions-answered)

Should be possible with enough experience.

**Who issues the EU blue card**

The immigration services of the country in which the employment and residence will be taken up.

>EU Blue Card law dictates European immigration services to issue the
>Blue Card work and residence permit within three months. This is
>considerably faster than most local alternatives.

So we get the Blue card in 3 months, once an empoyee chooses us, and
sponsors the blue card.

**When do you loose your Blue card?**

>EU Blue Card holders are allowed to go back to their home countries
>or other non-EU states for a maximum of 12 consecutive months without

**EU blue card to PR to Citizenship**

>Yes. You must work for 33 months in the hosting state or 21 months
>while also earning the B1 language certificate which enables you to
>qualify for the permanent residency permit earlier. Furthermore, if
>you work in different EU member states and gather 5 years of work

So it is clear. 21 months with B1 in the hosting state or 5 years in
different states all put together in the bluecard.

**Bypassing my problems**

Apply for PR and apply for passport simultaneously. I am confident I
will get a PR. It will take me atleast 3 years from now to receive it
in hand.

People have gotten their Citizenship rejected and Pr not as in the
same post above, for not meeting the requirements. However, appeals
can be made. I need to write soem FB posts and check with others
regarding what works and not.

**Q&A in the website**

[Indians in Netherlands Citizenship](http://indiansinnetherlands.com/my-experiences/dutch-citizenship/) is gold. 

Masoud: What do they check when applying for citizenship? RP
records/gemente records?

Suri: Only if you de-register it is a problem, otherwise, it is not!

Mostly my case but it is risky considering I was not in the country.
