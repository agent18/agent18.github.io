## The different components


Impact of someone who is outside the US and trying to get into Masters
in the US.

1. Finishing master's and getting a job (70-80% => 62 to 71%)

2. Getting a H1B within OPT years (58%)

3. Getting FAANG job in 2-4 years after finishing masters (90%)

4. not moving back due to recession or general firing

5. Impact per year based year 2023 (150k)

6. growth rate (5%)

7. Amount donable? 20% to 50%

8. Number of years say 30

**Not now**: Want to also get into the share market in the mean time. Increase and
grow money.

Maybe it is safe to then say that fermi estiamte... God blessu, with
Data Science atleast you know wherre you are at. Try to be the best
version you can and thats about it I guess. I can't manipulate these
numbers to give me what I want.

## Considering Canada perhaps

Drop the value by like 30 to 50% and that will the impact nu let's
assume.
