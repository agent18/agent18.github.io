I would like to figure out what I should be doing, i.e., to go behind determining a value system?
or to just be as I am
or kill myself.

In order to do that, I first gather that I have conflicting views. Views that keep changing all the time. Views that seem to not make sense (ex: Scope sensitivity). It appears that I don't know what I want? and Even if I want something, I don't know if I really want it.
