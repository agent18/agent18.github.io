+# Begin<sub>Quote</sub>

Some of the best ways to gain career capital early on include:

Working in any organisation which has, or with any people who have, a
reputation for high performance e.g. top consultancy or technology
firms, or any work with a great mentor or team.  Undertaking certain
graduate studies, especially applied quantitative subjects like
economics, computer science and applied mathematics.  Anything that
gives you a valuable transferable skill e.g. programming, data
science, marketing.  Taking opportunities which allow you to achieve
impressive and socially valuable things e.g. founding an organisation,
doing anything at which you might excel.
