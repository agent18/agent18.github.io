#### **Story so far**

In the post on Map vs Territory we learned that our belief is far from the reality. We saw in the post on emperical evidence the need to look at evidence and judge our beliefs rather than just take them at face value. In an attempt to do so, we plan to make falsifiable hypothesis and test them against data. In places we already have data, like say for example how many calories you would need etc..., we have enough evidence. There is no problem here. But in places where there is no evidence such as, why I want a particular house instead of the other and or just assuming that I need to have a girlfriedn could be rather dangerours. Scooping out the data from nothing, and planning it into our reasoning and using evidence to judge a hypothesis is what we need to do.

For this we use the scientific method. What I explained aboveis also the scientific method. The scientific method is basically, when you make a falsifiable hypothesis, and then you go around and look for evidencein the field and then make a conclusion if OK or NOK.

Some of the thoughts of the types of things I would like to know more are: Why be moral? Why go after saving lifes? Is it possible to live without girls for the rest of your life?

What are the skills you need to learn, Which charity to donate and why?

Why be more R-word, What all do I need to do the like
