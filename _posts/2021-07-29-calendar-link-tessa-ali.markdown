## write in fb

Hi,

I am trying to get to help an EA org with something. The goal is to
get these type of links: "add to calendar", "add to google Calendar",
etc. And use them in an email to invite people. I was looking into it
and can't believe how ridiculous it is to get things done. Any help is
appreciated.
