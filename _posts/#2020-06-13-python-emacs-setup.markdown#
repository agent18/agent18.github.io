## Summary:

**Terminal**

`which python` to know where it is pointing to in terminal

`base` is the environment  which means it has a particular python and
a particular set of libraries.

`conda activate base`

**Emacs**

environment `base` given in init file with:   

	(setq python-shell-interpreter "/home/eghx/anaconda3/bin/ipython")

`M-x run-python` seems to open an ipython console which works


`sys.version` and `sys.prefix` in python to check which "environment"
is installed.


While installing python libraries such as `learntools`, as long as we
install (`conda install scipy`, look below on how to install non-conda
libraries) it in the `base` environment in the terminal (`source
anaconda3/bin/activate` or `conda activate base`), then it seems to be
**available in EMACS too**. :)

## Installing pythiath

Rumor has it that anaconda is the shiz and the "best" way to work with
python. I am comfortable with it

## Installing Anaconda

> Anaconda® is a **package manager**, an environment manager, a Python/R
> data science distribution, and a collection of over 7,500+
> open-source packages. Anaconda is free and easy to install, and it
> offers free community support.

- Check which python is used, [if Anaconda is installed](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/python-path/)

		which python

- [installing anacoda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) as per the website

	Don't know what this is but did it anyway. ["Verification of
    install file"](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1189769/sha256sum-path-filename-no-such-file-or-directory)
	
		sha256sum ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-xxxx.xx-Linux-x86_64.sh

	Download anaconda x86 and python 3.5 linux xxxx.xx. ~~I added
    [sudo](https://askubuntu.com/a/887558/443958).~~ But I suspect maybe that was causing some
    issues. Website doesn't say sudo. Non sudo version seems to have
    `conda update conda` working while I am still in the base.
	
		sudo bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-xxxx.xx-Linux-x86_64.sh		
		
		bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-xxxx.xx-Linux-x86_64.sh		
		
	Say yes to all.

	`(base) $eghx@eghxnitro` start appearing as opposed to the regular
    thing on the terminal. 
	
		conda config --set auto_activate_base False
		
	close and open terminal and the `(base)` is gone.
	
	
	Verify your install using:
	
		conda list #Lists all packages in the current ENV
		
	Select env `base`
	
		source anaconda3/bin/activate 
		
	Type `python` and see with `sys.prefix` where this python leads to.
		
	
## What is `(base)` (MORE INFO)
 
It points to the python environment "selected"(`which python`) i.e.,
Anacondas's, explicitly in the terminal. Use the following to see
which python is alive (e.g., anaconda or default installation etc.)

> Switching from the (base) to the deactivated (base) implies
> switching from one python interpreter to another one - that may be
> checked using which.---[stack](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55134732/5986651)



`(base)` is a python environment currently pointing to the anaconda
installation.

- de-activating the `base` env

		conda deactivate

- Activating the `base` env

		source anaconda3/bin/activate 
		
- Currently the above is activated by default thanks to the following
  lines in you `.bashrc`


**Verdict**

It's ugly to have it in the terminal. Then,
- deactivate and risk the chance of using another python by mistake when working
- & have to activate every single time.

If you don't want to activate it every single time and permanently
modify where `which python` points to? Then you can do it by changing
the `PATH` variable as shown [in this stack answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55134899/5986651). But this is
[*Discouraged*](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55134899/5986651) as per "conda release notes".
	
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnhjvHYRsmM) was the most useful. Other links from
[stack1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55134440/in-conda-what-is-the-differece-between-base-environment-and-no-environment-at). Other links from [stack 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55133808/with-conda-anaconda-should-i-work-in-base-all-the-time).

I DON'T use pythiath on the terminal. So I will *deactivate it PERMANENTLY*. I use
it in EMACS and when that happens I will `setq`. (Look at the
caution. I think we are gonna have some problems).

	conda config --set auto_activate_base false

**Caution:**

Changing where the default python is looking at in say EMACS might
have other consequences.

Figure out with time...

## Python to Ipython  on terminal and Emacs

- how to make it work with emacs

- there seem to be some variables which have access to it.
	
`conda list` already shows `ipython` package already installed.

So in the normal terminal when the `base` env is not turned on, then
you don't get the `python` you want. Needless to say even `ipython`
doesn't work there. But once you toin on `base` using `source
 anaconda3/bin/activate` then 'alles sier goed'.
 
 If situation forces you to action, do the following, but it didn't
 work for me as per [ipython's site](https://ipython.org/install.html).
 
	conda update conda
	conda update ipython	
	
or as per another [stack comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29341708/anaconda-ipython-not-running)	
	
	conda update conda
	conda update ipython ipython-notebook ipython-qtconsole
	
	
Ipython help is give [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html). There are magic functions, tab
completion things and some shortcut commands that could be used here.

**IPython in emacs has many features that don't work** 

Had some issues such as the console behaving wierd! with
many letters shown inplace of one.

Finally was able to solve it after many many hours of relentless
debugging and emacs stack had the answer anyways. :)

**Error** I got was similar garbled (wierd) text when I opened IPYTHON
with `C-c C-p` on my simple python file `print("hello World")`.

    ppppprrrrriiiiinnnnnttttt((((("""""HHHHHeeeeellllllllllooooo     
    WWWWWooooorrrrrlllllddddd""""")))))))))))))))
    Hello World

**Solution** verbatim as per [@ricardoLima's answer][1] didn't work
for me. I had to re-write it as follows.

    (setq python-shell-interpreter "/path/to/bin/ipython")
    (setq python-shell-interpreter-args "--simple-prompt -i")

**TIP:**

Just use `emacs -q` in the terminal to open a no-init emacs and run
these commands with `M-:`. `M-x run-python` and you are good to go.

**P.S.**

## Checking setup with EMACS

Ask emacs to look at the right python, [use code](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49807116/5986651) and add to emacs
init file:

	(setq python-shell-interpreter "/path/to/python")

Ask emacs to run a python shell, [use code](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50242869/5986651):

	M-x run-python

interpreter ipython python shell python interpreter???


what is interpreter

	sys.version

To see which python your interpreter is using, [use code](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53952253/5986651): 

	sys.prefix
	
## conda not working (uninstall and re-install is the only way!)

Error on `conda update conda`

``` bash
Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): failed

NotWritableError: The current user does not have write permissions to a required path.
  path: /home/eghx/.conda/pkgs/urls.txt
  uid: 1000
  gid: 1000

If you feel that permissions on this path are set incorrectly, you can manually
change them by executing

  $ sudo chown 1000:1000 /home/eghx/.conda/pkgs/urls.txt

In general, it's not advisable to use 'sudo conda'.

```

https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9004#issuecomment-517955252

	conda config --set allow_conda_downgrades true
	conda install conda=4.6.14

Not working same error

**JUST UNINTSALL AND FOLLOW INSTALLION PROCEDURE AGAIN**


## Uninstalling/re-installing anaconda

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/

The following didn't work

	conda install anaconda-clean 

So I ended up following the stack answer from 2016 about removal of
all folders and the contents in the `.bashrc`
file. https://stackoverflow.com/a/40159908/5986651


	sudo rm -rf ~/anaconda3
	sudo rm -rf ~/.condarc ~/.conda ~/.continuum

*I think I needed to use SUDO because I used it in the
installation*. I am going to test it and not use any fucking
sudo. Let's see.


## Installing packages with Conda

https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#searching-for-packages

Check if package exists,

	conda list
	
	conda list numpy

To check if package exists,

	conda search scipy curl
	
Install package from search using `conda install ...`

Packages are available with `conda search` are from `conda`. Packages
are also available at `anaconda.org`. If packages (such as `learntool`
for Kaggle) are not available in both `conda` or `anaconda.org`, then
they are `non-conda` packages.
### Installing packages with conda install

[Fastai man page](https://github.com/fastai/fastai):

	conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda fastai 

Can also be done (it appears) with the github link and then `environment.yml`: 

	git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai2
	cd fastai2
	conda env create -f environment.yml
	source activate fastai2

With[ pip](https://forums.fast.ai/t/platform-local-server-ubuntu/65851/22?u=thetj09):

	git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai2
	cd fastai2
	pip install -e ".[dev]"
	
**Note about Pip**

> Just in case you haven’t found that one. They can coexist, but maybe
> not in a way you’d expect. Pip can easily be run inside conda. You

### Installing non-conda packages

Packages are also available at `anaconda.org`. If packages (such as
`learntool` for Kaggle) are not available in both `conda` or
`anaconda.org`, then they are `non-conda` packages.

If not available in all of the above, `conda/pip install
link-to-tar.gz` (in the base or respective environment) is still an
option.

In the case of `learntools` none of that works. So downloaded the repo
to pkgs. `cd` into the downloaded unzipped folder. `activate` the base and then,

	python setup.py install

[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36164986/how-to-install-package-in-anaconda).

And now it is available to emacs. It appears that the packages are
tied to the `python` selected. That seems good. :) Pandian le

## Understanding environments

Every environment seems to have it's own python and packages.

[Conda help on environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

**Create** environment: `conda create -n myenv python=3.6`

**Clone** environment: `conda create --name fastai --clone base`

**add packages** to environment: `conda install -n myenv scipy` (or go to
environment and just `conda install ipthon` for example)

**activate conda env**: `conda activate myenv`  (you will see a `(myenv)`
in front in the terminal)

**List packages** in environment: Go to environment and then `conda list`

**How to work on a particular environment in Emacs?**

0. Create environment  myenv

1. install necessary packages

2. Modify init file or `M-:` with right link to python or shell
   interpreter obtainable from `which python` e.g., `(setq python-shell-interpreter
   "/home/eghx/anaconda3/bin/ipython")`

3. Test

Really simple.

Delete environment: `conda env remove --name myenv` or `conda remove
--name myenv --all`

Check if deleted: `conda info --envs`



Great so far so good.

### conda install with environment.yml

	conda env create -f environment.yml
	conda activate EnvironmentName


	conda env update -f environment.yml
	conda activate EnvironmentName

## Jupyter notebook it is

**epistemic status:** I think jupyter was installed with the base already?
but I checked right? As spyder is already.

Some discussion on Jupyterlab vs Jupyter on [stack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50982686/what-is-the-difference-between-jupyter-notebook-and-jupyterlab). Atleast
someone switched back to Jupyter notebook and people advising
beginners to go to Jupyter notebook.

**Conda installation**

	conda install -c conda-forge notebook

This directly installs jupiter in the `base` env as that is the one
that is active.

**Start Jupyter**

	conda activate base
	
	jupyter notebook
