Just saw the email. Sorry about the delay.

I'll keep this brief. Until you find a new source of income,
presumably in data science, you have to keep working in your current
field. So, if the next step is to get a data science job, I recommend
spending nearly all your available time in getting results along that
path. Namely, cracking a data science interview (or ten) and getting a
foot in the door, regardless of whether the company is big or
small. The "claims practice" can wait till you've found your next
source of income.

But STM my question initially to you is about working lesser in
current field while I do the "next important thing" (Work on DS
interview, or blog post responding to your criticisms about my career
essay, or plain old DP). Cause it appears I can work less without
consequences such as getting fired and worrying about income. I think
I should do it, unless you see potential issues with it. Please let me
know.

Thank you for clarifying this. I will first clarify my thinking on my
next actions first.
