+ Do you feel you understand what a relevant factor is and why they
  are important?
  
  I think I understand what a relevant factor is based on the
  examples. It appears that for a variable (switch on/off) to be a
  relevant factor for an outcome (bulb glows), we need to see that
  altering the variable(switching on and off) leads to the changing
  outcome (bulb glows and not). If switch is on and outcome is bulb
  glowing. Jumping to conclusions that switch is a relevant factor is
  absurd. Same with the HPMOR example where Hermoine (and I) looked at
  the rule variable with value: "number jumps by the same amount
  (10-20-30)", and decided that it was a relevant factor based on all
  outcomes being only YES. This is like keeping the switch on and
  seeing the bulb glow and concluding the bulb is a relevant
  factor. If only we looked at varying the rule, i.e., (1,2,100) and
  the outcome is still YES, then we have no business calling the
  aforementioned rule a relevant factor. She (and I) did not try
  explain the CHANGE but EXPLAINED THE ABSOLUTE OUTCOME. As I
  write this sentence, it hits home what the title means.:)
  
  Why are they important? Don't have one example where I might be
  making these errors as of now.

+ Do you understand the hypothesis, i.e., that to accept a relevant
  factor, we need to see it change along with the output?
  
  YES

+ Were you able to follow the examples?

  YES.

+ Were the examples about riots and strife and poverty too abstract? Did they seem like convincing real-world problems?

 I like the formal way of thinking (subject, predicate, example
 definition, now FIGHT). It makes life comprehensible for
 me. Similarly using words such as "variable", "outcome", "change
 variable", "check outcome". This formal way appears to be lacking in
 these explanation with riots and strife. Whereas with HPMOR and
 regret-free living, you stressed on it, which I like which drove
 home the point I think.
 
 And I want to say I don't like these abstract ("made-up", not
 concrete) examples. Maybe you can only stick to "real-life examples"
 such as the one with Robyn Dawes or HPMOR or Regrets of Dying. The
 bulb was ok to start the point, HPMOR and the dying example, shows
 how in real life I could make that mistake.
 
+ Did the 2-4-6 test help? Did you catch the problem by yourself? Did
  the final explanation help?
  
  YES, No I didn't catch it. Yes the final explanation helped. Very
  good example IMHO. Drove the point.

+ Was the Fifth Column example clear? Helpful?

    Yes in hindsight, when I read it again.

+ What about the regrets of the dying example?


	YES, only after you axed me if I found something fishy. Thats when
    I activated the SST and started working. Until then I guess I was
    just reading and nodding ("it all makes sense! Sure").


+ Where do you think you or others might be making this mistake in
  real-life? You could try using the existing examples as the starting
  point from which to think of other applications.

	All Claims? 
	
	**Claims**: Going to the gym every day feels awesome. 
	
	And let's say you really want to identify if the gym is an
    important factor for your feeling of awesomeness
	
	**Outcome**: feels awesome
	
	**Variable**: Things we do in life
	
	Only when you don't go to the gym and you feel like shit, can you
    atleast consider it as a relevant factor, otherwise you don't have
    sufficient information to consider it as a relevant factor.
	
	I tried. ;)

I was quite disappointed to see the "cars" when we were talking about
bulbs. Like it threw me off. I didn't know what you were trying to say
there. I suspect you moved away from the running example to drive a
point.

This was really confusing. I didn't know who you were talking about
(which "he" the author was referring to?). I had to read it a few
times. 

> Where could people make this kind of mistake?

Just want to suggest something. Why not a real-world example here
instead of dragons?

I couldn't follow it at that the time of reading the essay. Even now
when I read it, I have to make a serious effort and go slowly over
each word, place an example on it and read it. Maybe it would be
helpful to connect with an actual example say in brackets?  For
example: "If the default outcome is one thing (bulb not glowing) and
you get a different thing (bulb starts to glow)"
