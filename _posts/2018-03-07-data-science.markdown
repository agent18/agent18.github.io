# First impressions

Opportunities to learn seem boundless, be it free or paid. Estimated
learning time before starting in a company is about 3 months
(full-time conservative?). Money is lot better than what I am doing
now. Allows some scope for direct working. It looks like this could be
an option if earning-to-give is not really the primary option,
although I suspect I should be able to do 50k$/ year within the next
10 years if I am at the top tech firms. Personal fit wise, this
appears to be the closest to what I can migrate to work wise.

# Diving into the details

- Skills obtainable: Problem-solving, programming, large
  data-analysis, all of which are transferable.
  
- Connections: No idea. But my friend in DS who worked in MuSigma
  India, now in Apple seems to have worked with big-shots. If direct
  work is my goal, I should network with the right people, say within
  80k hours team.  But to reach them I need to be a high achiever. In
  other words, connections are good, nothing out of the normal.
  
  I suspect it would be possible to meet the best people at the best
  places, like Google, Facebook, or in start-ups. 
  
- Credentials: The impression I get based on what [80k hours DS
  profile][80k-hrs-cc] says, is that the success is tangible, although
  not as crystal clear as in marketing/sales. So basically, it should
  be possible to explain to future employers based on my progress and
  level of problems solved and achievements and $ saved/made for an
  organization. 
  
  At my current job as a design engineer, I can't really boast of
  crazy achievements for a future employer.

- Runway: Actually I am not sure what I am expected to do with this. I
  will always have enough runway for 12-18 months. Salary wise it is
  expected for a graduate in the US to be paid ~ 100k $. In Holland if
  it is a large company I will be paid 46k Euros at start and ~40k
  Euros if it is smaller company as I will be a fresher. Growth from
  there on is not sure, but I would like to migrate to the big
  companies and slowly find myself in the US in the real valley.
  
  This is decent paying job. I should have enough runway and more to
  give, than what I am doing now, but say after 2 years. I suspect I
  need to clock a few years before I can ask for the big buck. Also
  experience would count then.
  
## Best ways to gain career capital for DS

- Working in reputed organizations: Should be possible. Everyone is
  interested in DS nowadays. Even flight companies. Maybe in the start
  it is possible to work already with the big ones. But to go to
  Google and others I suspect it takes a few years ( at least 2 years
  to gain some solid experience)
					
- Quantitative graduate studies: Masters in the US/Holland/Germany in
  DS is an option, this way I can get to go to US. Either do studies
  in stats or pure DS as my friend in apple would suggest.
  
  Only problem is I am not sure I can fund my own education and be at
  the risk of not getting paid for 2 years followed by not getting a
  job. Would be ideal way to go to US but the shot is not for sure.
		
- Valuable transferable skill: Yes I will know more about programming,
  and will get better at problem solving, statistics. These
  appear to be transferable to other jobs. It is predicted that
  the market grows in size by 18% from 2010 to 2020. Not sure what
  that means, but the fact that 80k hours says it, informs me that it
  is worth investing in it.
		
- Taking opportunities which allow you to achieve impressive and
  socially valuable things:
  
  Possibly within the top tech firms or with NGO's such as Center for
  Disease Control, Google, Khan Academy, Bayes Impact and DataKind
	 
  
- General: Reasonable working conditions (40-50 hrs in US),
  Intellectually satisfying.

# TODO by next week

* [ ] Speak to people who are in DS in Netherlands and how they got
  there(vaidehi and tim van der linde)

* [x] Speak to someone in the US to know about the scene

* [ ] Write part 2


P.S

Spent 1.5 hrs writing and reading and re-editing max with more than
1.5 hrs of break in between. Horrible. Rushed to finish the essay due
to mass procrastination.
