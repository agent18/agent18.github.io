What if it happens that I need to stay there for a few more days say
due to hospitalizations, can I extend insurance?

> The insurance can be taken out for the exact duration of your
> holiday. However, we recommend choosing a much longer term. If you
> end up in hospital during your holiday, you will retain coverage and
> the insurance will not expire 'just like that'. If nothing happens
> during your holiday, you can cancel your insurance per day after
> your return with a refund of any excess premium paid.
