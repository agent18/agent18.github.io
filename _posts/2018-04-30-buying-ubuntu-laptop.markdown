## Basics

-Use [ubuntu-certified-hardware](https://certification.ubuntu.com/certification/) to find out if your hardware is
ubuntu certified. Helps in knowing if ubuntu is already going to work
with it.

-Always google said laptop with keywords: Laptop name, ubuntu,
linux. Check for issues in that laptop

-Know your laptop and what you are getting

## Current laptop problems 

Basically wifi gave up after a year or 2 of usage, no going back,
apparently, laptop screen started flickering and is not portable
anymore. Performance has always been slow. One of my friends pointed
some potential issues with the video drivers for the curent amd
scene. In addition, sleeping kills performance, boot up takes 2 mins I
think. But the irony is I have seen a laptop only being slept for
months, but still opening applications, the same ones that I use in
seconds.

On a fresh boot my system hangs and is super super slow, even while
running just some basic chrome and emacs. This is odd for what is
expected from ubuntu. It makes a lot of sound, informing high
processor usage when I a run a video for example.

Bottom line, I have spent time and tried to fix this. A lot of
time. Not worth it anymore. Time to retire and start with something
that is known to give less problems and cheap.

Problems documented by me alone are, [Video driver problem](https://askubuntu.com/questions/804013/ubuntu-stuck-at-shutdown-after-connecting-to-external-screen/804831#804831), [Wifi
problem](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1001123/rt3290-ralink-wifi-drops-every-5-mins-ubuntu-14-04)

  * [ ] I need 500gb hardisk space
Well I will adjust. I don't know why I need so much space anyway. I
will buy an external when needed or use cloud storage as needed.

  * [ ] No errors or issues online
There are some errors and problems, but they seem to have been
verified.

  * [x] something that I can return if I dont like
Yes and within 30 days.

  * [ ] should be able to run emacs, browser with 10 tabs, atleast one
        with video streaming in it, playable fortnite is a bonus

Doesn't seem to have those video driver problems

  * [x] 4gb ram
  
  * [x] INTEL
  
  * [x] Windows in parallel?
  
  * [x] Should work for 2 years atleast
  
>Restart your computer once more and press the appropriate key to

Its 4 years old with one year warranty.

## Buying ubuntu pre-installed?

Might be pricy. New laptops are always pricy and not required at the moment.

## Using a chromebook

It is basically linux os. Hardware should be fine, but usually comes
with tiny specs as it is meant for being light and carrying around!

## Why not a Desktop

I would like a laptop, one that I can move around.

## Buying second-hand

Places to buy

  * [x] informatique
Useless, doens't appear to have refurbished lappies

  * [x] mediamarkt
Seems no refurbished laptops are here.

  * [ ] bol.com

  * [ ] coolblue

  * [ ] azerty

  * [x] tweedehandsnotebook.nl 
  
This one is good with good reviews, and customer service and
returnability etc..., the first one I found online and within budget.

## TODO

  * [x] Check System76 for what types of laptops they sell, maybe you
        can buy them
		
Not much use with Sytem 7, they have pricy laptops and thats it, they
are not from known brands. 
		
  * [x] Find cheapest laptop and put up your research on it, such as
        specs, cost, where to buy and run over the basics part.


## Reflection

In the last three months. I spent atleast 20-30 hours fixing
wifi. Spent 50 euros on the screen which doens't work. Spent another
15-30 hrs trying to fix new problems, such as a hanging system, even
on a fresh ass install. 

I spent 10-20 hrs determining what laptop I should buy, and finally
bought it today. Will spend another 10 hrs installing and trying out things
and getting the new laptop to speed. Fingers crossed, less problems.

Why am I wasting so much time like this, when there are other things I
should be doing?

Everything takes time. Discovering that there is a problem, attempting
to fix it etc... There is also the rhetoric of 'hurdles are for
learning'. When do you stop fixing or trying fixes on your ubuntu
anyway? What do you do when nothing online works? You ask a
friend/guy-with-some-experience and when the friend says it is toast,
I give up. 

Also, possibly that spending money to buy a new lappy hurts and somehow
consuming (consumerism) is also "wrong". "I am not like the others who
consume uselessly, I have a higher purpose and am better than these
people", is the rhetoric I share at some subconcious level I guess.

I knew my computer was fucked on march 1st. Today is may 1. An
appaling 2 months, before I ordered. Why?

I guess the system was still just usable. I usually waste time endlessly on a
weekend, on every weekend and get no work done and hence don't buy
anything. I have a phone sitting right next to me and asking me to use
it. There is youtube, primevideo and all sorts of distractions, I fill
my life with, such that it is easy to get distracted.
