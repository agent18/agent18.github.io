## Introduction

My last deliberate practice session to improve the 'ability to make
examples' informed that a lot of work is still required.


## Feedback on last essay

## Mission #6 by an STM

Mission #6: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, would be to
clarify material that genuinely confuses you. (Did your spider-sense
start tingling for the last two phrases? It should have.)

Primary target: Some work-related document that you need to understand
thoroughly but currently don't. Take it apart almost word-by-word and
provide a *concrete* example for each one.

For example, "habeas corpus" sounds like a confusing legal term. But
once I've seen an example for it
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus#Examples), I know it
pretty well and can follow along when I hear it in another case. Even
somebody who has no idea of the jargon can understand by looking at
the concrete example. Note that the theoretical definition ("Habeas
corpus is a recourse in law through which a person can report an
unlawful detention or imprisonment to a court and request that the
court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to
bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is
lawful.") is not good enough - it's not a concrete example.

Secondary target: Some non-technical document that you want to
understand thoroughly but currently don't.

Reps: 200.

Success criteria: Does it feel less confusing? Does it now feel
crystal-clear? (<spider-sense tingling>)

Best,

## Material to work on

I am thinking something from the DSS course, as I don't have anything
related to work as yet. And Can't pull out documents!

How about stuff from Shigley?

or how about stuff from the thesis? or internship?

or maybe rob munning smidt on dynamics!

log log, dynamics

dynamics by rixen?

## Principle of Virtual works

So now that I am going to work in dynamics, I see a large scope to be
strong in fundamentals! 

So we start with the principle fo virtual works. I have spent some
time recently and made "quite some progress" in understanding it (with
examples), during my interviews. So lets just say I know if atleast
decently. 



### Lecture notes from Daniel J Rixen TU Delft

P:
> The (analytical approach)[1] to (mechanics)[2], unlike (vector
> mechanics)[3], is based on the (concepts of energy and work)[4] and
> therefore provides a (better understanding)[5] of (mechanical
> phenomena)[6]. (It provides)[7] at the same time a (very powerful

E: For the work I did on the IC engine, to know the position of the
different parts with time[2], we wrote the newton equations in XYRz
for each part and then solved all the equations simultaneously to
obtain the forces[1,11].

In this ![Truss problem](./images-DP-3/truss.jpg), the goal is to find the force for the
system to be in equilibrium. We could write the individual equations
for each part (3 equations per part)[3], or we could write one
equation using the energy stored in the spring[4a] and the work done
by the force F [4b] for a small displacement and come to the same
solution (Principle of virtual works (POVW))[7,9,14]. 

When we use POVW this is the equation: `F*dy=0.5*k*dx^2`, contains
stiffness, force and geometry. You see the relation between F and k [6],
you increase F then k needs to be increased as well [6]! Period! If we
write the same in vector mechanics, first we would have 6 equations
and simplifying will give an equation which would also contain the
internal and reaction forces which we are not interested in. This
would make it hard to see if an increase in F leads to an increase in
k[5].

In vector mechanics, we have 6 equations and in POVW we have 1
equation[10] (`F*dy=0.5*k*dx^2`)[12] for this truss problem [13].

Consider a double pendulum system[13]. They are dynamic in nature
(position changes with time). As opposed to 6 equations we
have 2 equations [10] which describe the position information using a
differential equation like `m*l^2*\\ddot(\\theta) + mgl*sin(\\theta)`
[12] while using POVW.

P: gives rise in natural manner

E:
So we now have a few differential which needs to be solved to get the
position vs time information `theta(t)=...`. For [simple differential
equations](https://mathinsight.org/ordinary_differential_equation_introduction_examples) it is possible to get the solution. But for systems
like the Navier-Stokes equations describing the fluids in motion they
have a lot of components and terms [which is impossible to solve
without many assumptions](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-solve-every-differential-equation-in-this-world). This leads to something else.[15,19]

P: approximate numerical methods

E: Find the root of 𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥−5.

let's guess 𝑥=1: 𝑓(1)=1−5=−4. A negative number. Let's guess 𝑥=6:
𝑓(6)=6−5=1. A positive number.

The answer must be between them. Let's try 𝑥=(6+1)/2: 𝑓(7/2)<0

E: We observe certain aspects in nature, like the positive getting
attracted to the negative charge, the north pole of a magnet attracted
to the south pole of a magnet. It is just nature. Hence this book also
deals from the Maxwell laws when discussing electromagnetism. Maxwell
laws describes the nature

P: these laws

E: We do not discuss why magnetic field is generated by an electric
field. We see it in nature just like the attraction of the north pole
of a magnet to the south pole of a magnet.

P: subject is presented
E: how doorbell works using maxwell laws with belief

So I started with a breadboard and was informed that a [certain way of
connections](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/transistors/applications-i-switches) the transistor acts as a switch with a very small base
control current[1]. I accepted this[2] and made the line follower
robot. I took a couple of transistors and made the circuit[3,4] as
though transistors acting as switches[5] was true.

(Struggled in explaining understood and what causes these laws to be true)




(These basic laws)[] are called the “Maxwell equations” and will be
presented in the following to be used in the further practical
implementation. The Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk
Maxwell (1831-1879) formulated his equations partially based on the
work of previous scientists, but the laws got his name because of the
way he combined them. The Maxwell equations are a set of four
equations, with the status of physical laws, stating the relationships
between the electric and magnetic fields and their sources being
charge density and current density.  Table 5.1 defines the variables
that play a role in this chapter. For a complete overview also the
electrical variables, that were defined in Chapter 2 are
mentioned. Like the previously defined electric field E, the
electrical current density J is a vector field representing the
movement of free, or unbound charges in space. The electric
permittivity 0 has also been previously defined and the electric
charge density ρ q represents the amount of unbound charges in a
volume.

The magnetic field B is a vector field. Like with the electric field, it is
graphically represented by the density and direction of magnetic flux lines.
In the design of electromagnetic actuators, the magnitude of the magnetic
field in the direction of interest is called the flux density B. It directly
relates to the quantitative nature of the magnetic flux Φ in that direction,
calculated by integrating the magnetic field over a surface perpendicular to

## principle of virtual work for a particle (7)


> Let us consider (a particle of mass m)[1], (submitted to a force field **X**)[2]
> (of components Xi)[3] in an (inertial frame)[4]. The (dynamic equilibrium)[5] of
> the particle can be expressed in (d’Alembert’s form)[6]

	m*üi − Xi = 0      where i=1,2,3

> where ui represents the (displacement of the particle)[7].

Imagine a pendulum pulled to a height h from its rest vertically and
let go of[1]. The gravitational force acts on it (0,mg) [2,3]. The
forces are defined in a frame such that if the pendulum is in its mean
position (with 0 net force) then is does not accelerate [4].

When the pendulum is pulled to a height and let go of, the pendulum is
in dynamic equilibrium[5]. When it is stationary at the mean position it
is in static equilibrium. d'Alhembert's form is the `F-ma=0`
form [6]. 

P: Displacement of a particle[7]

E: When the pendulum moves from mean position to 90 degree position
the displacement in X direction is length of the pendulum.

---

Let us next imagine that the (particle)[1] follows during the time interval
[t1 , t2 ] a (motion trajectory ui*)[2] (distinct from the real one)[3]
ui. This (allows us)[4] to define the (virtual displacement of the particle)[5]
by the relationship (figure 1.1)

	δui = ui* − ui

![virtual displacement](./images-DP-3/VD.png)

The pendulum[1] moves from the mean position to say 90 degrees (B) to the
right (ui). ui* is when the pendulum ball takes any other route to
B[2,3]. The difference between these 2 is the virtual displacement.


By its very definition, the virtual displacement δui is arbitrary for t1 < t < t2.

Let us next multiply the dynamic equilibrium equations (1.1) by the associated virtual
displacement and sum over the components: the virtual work expression results


	sum_from_1_to_3[(müi − Xi)δui] = 0


This expression represents the scalar product between the forces acting on the particle and
the virtual displacement δu. −
 →
 It thus represents the projection of the equilibrium along the
direction δu. →
 −
 If (1.3) is satisfied for all variations δu i, then the trajectory ui(t) satisfies the
dynamic equilibrium in all directions.

If no kinematical constraint is imposed onto the particle, namely of no restriction is
imposed on the possible displacement of the particle, the trajectory of the material point
is determined by the equilibrium in all directions.

If kinematic constraints are specified for the particle, there exist
reaction forces on top of the applied forces. These reaction forces
ensure that the imposed kinematical constraints are satisfied and
depend on the trajectory itself. Hence they are unknown a
priori. Figure 1.2 describes a particle constrained to move along a
plane curve and a spherical pendulum where a particle is constrained
to have a constant distance with respect to a fixed point.  On one
hand, the presence of reaction forces acting in the direction of the
constraint gen- erally renders the equilibrium description more
complex since those unknown forces must be determined along the entire
trajectory such that kinematical constraints are satisfied.  On the
other hand, solving the equilibrium equations in the direction
constrained by the kinematical conditions is not useful since, in that
direction, the trajectory is prescribed by the constrained and thus
known.

In the system described in figure 1.2.a only the motion along the
direction tangent to the curve needs to be determined. In doing so,
the reaction forces, which act in the direction normal to the curve,
do not participate to the motion and thus need not to be
determined. The position of the particle in the direction normal to
the curve is obviously imposed by the constraint and does not require
solving the equilibrium equation in that direction. In the same way,
if the equilibrium of the particle of the spherical pendulum is
expressed in the plane tangent to the sphere (figure 1.2.b), only the
forces actually applied participate to determine the trajectory.

Let us therefore decide that, in the presence of kinematical constraints, we consider only
virtual displacements δui compatible with the constraints or, in other words, kinematically
admissible. Equation (1.3) then describes the projection of the dynamic equilibrium in the
space compatible with the constraints, namely in directions orthogonal to unknown reaction
forces. The form (1.3) does thus involve only effectively applied forces and stipulates that

*the virtual work produced by the effective forces acting on the particle during a
virtual displacement δui compatible with the constraints is equal to zero.*

This is the virtual work principle for a particle. Also, equations (1.3) indicates that

> if the trajectory ui of the particle is such that the effectively applied forces
> produce no virtual work for any virtual displacement compatible with the con-
> straints, the equilibrium is then satisfied.

The usefulness of the virtual work principle comes from the fact that it allows to
express the dynamic equilibrium in a simple manner along the directions compatible with
the constraints.

For example, if you look at data science in Google, you learn programming,
statistics, maths, and you about the industry you are working
in[1,4]. 

These skills are expected to become [increasingly valuable](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/#career-capital) in the
the future across wide range of industries (Phones, Cars, clothing,
supermarkets etc...)[2]. So if you wanted to go into an NGO like
GIVEWELL, the skills learned could allow you to migrate into that
sector [3].

In management consulting, you are always working with clients from the
top management (like managers and above). You are working with
different clients every 3 months typically. This gives you a lot of
connections who could help you find a job in the future [5].

Working at Google or BCG, or Mckinsey is already a Green Flag on your
CV. People respect you just for that [6].

With my current job I should be able to save 10k€ per year [7]. This
will last for a year of work.

My cousin is 40 years old and is doing sales in Dubai, he is
constantly having to be on his toes to make connections[1] which will
further his business. On the other spectrum if he doesn't make
connections he might lose his job and come back to India[2,3]. 

Learning a language at the age of 40 is much harder than when you
are 25. After 30 it is hard to learn new skills [4].

Now I am 27, and I am learning Data Science, working on "critical
thinking", learning dutch, and weight training so that it puts me in
the best position in the future (working at GiveWell or start my own NGO)[5].

[Peter](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/#3-develop-a-valuable-transferable-skill) was majoring in political science when he was 22[1]. He was
inclined to make a big difference in this world[3], but he didn't know
how, he could do law, charity work or programming[2]. He chose
computer programming as it would give him lot of income to donate and
a transferable skill[4,5]. If he didn't like it, it would be easier for
him to switch into an NGO to do charity work[6]. But not the other way
around. The organization he works for gives him skills  in programming
business and finance [7].

E: If you look at the [top 3 problem areas ](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/)[14] problem areas such as
AI, global priorities research, and promoting effective altruism, it
looks like none of them seem to need consulting or software
programming. [10]

You can enter AI if you are really good in math heavy research,
support roles, policy and strategy. For promoting effective altruism,
working directly in EA organizations and doing internships and
volunteer work gets you inside. For global priorities research, an
economics related degree, or political science, philosophy,
decision-making etc... [11,12]

Of the candidates featured in the 80k hours career guide,
I barely saw people with a consulting background or an MBA even, when
I surveyed it [here](http://agent18.github.io/Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html). [10]

E: Niel Bowerman entered priority path AI safety[16], from PhD in
climate physics [15b]. He got in touch with great people in the community
while being an advocate for climate change. This way he entered the
community and today he is AI Policy specialist at 80k hours[17]. On
the other hand[ Dillon](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/member-stories/dillon-bowen/) was going to pursue an economics PhD to work on
the priority paths [19].

Most People who applied or reported their career change to 80k hours,showed
interest in consulting rather than [15]. Instead, according to [80k
hours research](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/) [15a], they should be doing other things.

P: flexible career capital

E: Peter 22, is works for a firm that needs his programming skills
and also learns about finance and management at work. So he has the
option in the future to move into 3 different kind of roles and into
multiple sectors; useful in many different types of jobs, and likely
to remain useful in the future 

E2: Doing Data science gives you skills in programming, "problem
solving", statistics and detailed knowledge of the industry (for
example, if you are in self-driving cars, then you learn about that
industry and how it works as well")

P: Narrow career capital

E: Working in a non-profit straight out of university

P: difference

E: Kate ended up returning to the corporate sector for several years,
and would have ended up ahead if she’d done that straight away
(without starting at a non-profit straight out of university).

Working at a non-profit is a bad idea as you can apparently "create
much more impact" due to the mentorship an training offered at
businesses. Hard to build up runway, as you will be earning 50k$ when
you begin.

It’s [widely accepted in the non-profit sector](https://80000hours.org/2015/09/what-do-leaders-of-effective-non-profits-say-about-working-in-non-profits-interviews-with-givedirectly-deworm-the-world-initiative-development-media-international-schistosomiasis-control-initiativ/) that it’s easier to
switch from a business job to a non-profit job than vice versa. So if
you’re unsure between the two, a business position offers more
flexibility. [Source](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/#which-jobs-are-best-early-career)

Working at effective altruist organizations is in part of a bet on
the continued success of the effective altruism movement. If you think
there’s a significant risk of the movement stagnating or even
shrinking, then that’s a good argument against. [Source](https://80000hours.org/2015/11/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations-good-or-bad-for-career-capital/)

E: Working at EAO's[3a] keeps you well positioned for senior positions
in EA organizations. One can move in wide range of sectors but only
within the EA community[3]. For example, Neil Bowerman, started with
Climate Change and now is in freaking AI policy[3]. While working in
data science can lead to job switches in several sectors (mobiles
phones, self-driving cars, food-chains, supermarkets, clothing and
EAO's)[4].

The technical skills you develop also open the possibility to
transition into different roles including software engineering,
founding or joining early-stage startups, academia,2 and quant
finance. [Source](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/data-science/#career-capital)[4]

> If you’re (focused on)[5] our (top problem areas)[6], (narrow career

E: Niel Bowerman[5] was interested in climate advocacy[6] and pursued
it seriously and got into the EA community. He ended up getting
impressive achievements such as founding a think tank[8]. He works now
on AI policy[6] which he was able to use and transfer his skills,
reputation and connections into[7,8,8a]. Contrast this to him having
taken up a job in Software Engineering [9].

Following working at Mckinsey[10A], people tend to occupy chief of
staff positions for senior/influential public official or become
people of the top management for large companies. They also work
on strategy team for companies like Google, or work on the front lines
where they served as consultants, policy, private/equity etc... The
options seem to be a lot [10]. I [estimate here](./Summary-before-applying-to-80k.html) that working for
an EAO like 80k hours (with right skills and intention it is
definitely possible) could save 1100 lives, where as the best case
scenario of becoming a consultant and then partner, seems to save 1050
lives not including any probabilities of getting there (thumbs
down)[11]. 

P: very uncertain

E: You don't know if you can handle the stress of an Investment
banking/trading job, so you need to try something similar to see if
you are a good fit for it[12]. Hence you do not know if you want to Earn
to give or work directly [13].

E2: My friend was 26 when he decided to do a masters in computer
science in the US. He didn't know if he was up for AI research (say at
MIRI)[12] and hence it was unclear for him to either work for Google (ETG)
or to join MIRI.[13]

Tara gained skills in managing and making efficient[14,17] processes
within organizations related to healthcare[16] while working in
hospital and then later working in Bhutan with the RedCross[15]. Her
impressive achievements (saving 8M$ for the hospital) allowed her to
take on even bigger tasks like becoming the CEO of Centre for
Effective Altruism.

Discount rates on aligned-talent are quite high in some of the
priority paths, and seem to have increased, making career capital less
valuable.

However, from our career guide article, some people get the impression
that they should focus on consulting and similar options early in
their careers. This is because we put too much emphasis on
flexibility, and not enough on building the career capital that’s
needed in the most pressing problem areas.

We also enhanced this impression by listing consulting and tech
entrepreneurship at the top of our ranking of careers on this page
(now changed), and they still come up highly in the quiz. People also
seem to think that tech entrepreneurship is a better option for direct
impact than we normally do.

To address this problem, we plan to write an article in January
clarifying our position, and then rewrite the main guide article later
in the year. We’d also like to update the quiz, but it’s lower
priority.

We’ve had similar problems in the past with people misunderstanding
our views on earning to give and replaceability. To some extent we
think being misunderstood is an unavoidable negative consequence of
trying to spread complex ideas in a mass format – we list it in our
risks section below. This risk also makes us more keen on
“high-fidelity” in-person engagement and long format content, rather
than sharable but simplified articles.


## Statistics

1st day 3.5 hours

2nd day 3.9 hours

3rd day 10.7 hours (quit bb practice as I didn't get much done in the
day)

Sucked in the morning, half hour of sleep, coundn't do the techinical
stuff. 80k hours was not too easy, but I was able to make up for the
lost time.

Overall I felt good towards the end of the day. Not really bored I
think during any part of the day. Morning was intense though. 4 hrs
went by and I was racking my head to find examples.

4rth day  

Slow start but soodu pudikudhu! Finally figured out 3 secntences after
more than 1 hr. Takes time to research and right!
