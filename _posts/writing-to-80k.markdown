## In what ways did it affect you or your career plans?

TL;DR I spent a full year (600-900hrs) in 2017-2018 on 80k's website
coming up with what was best for my career. I wrote a 22k word
article, researched tons on how much impact each profile could have.
And after a year, ended up discarding the research I compiled based on
your website. Why? Because I was made to realize that I had compiled
info based on ENGLISH. I didn't know I had to question all the claims
in your website. I didn't realize how vague Career Capital is. I
didn't realize replaceability is a complicated concept. I didn't
realize "talent constraint" is extremely vague and no one knows what
each other is talking about. I didn't realize the surveys had so many
problems (money associated with a researcher was valued in millions
for example). Nor did I realize that I, thought I understood what
80000hours said, and guessed what certain things meant and "wasted" a
good chunk of my time on this. I try to explain below...

P.S  
I am really sorry I wanted to tone it down (but already spent 2
hrs writing this and it was getting close to the deadline).

### No examples Only English

Claims on your site are too vague I just don't understand them. I
thought I understood them until I came across **EA forum** where my
world just completely toppled over. This goes for the discussion on
Talent Constraint, my understanding of how competitive the EA orgs
are, to my understanding of replaceability, and how useful the EA
surveys were etc...

I wrote about Talent constraint ([agent 18 on EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hcdwSvGntCDJxCuqx/examples-of-people-who-didn-t-get-into-ea-in-the-past-but)) there
after. I have massive issues with the way you represent
replaceability. And I am tired of how you think you can just make
broad unverifiable claims and get away with it. Example below so you
understand what I am talking about.

**Claim:** "If you get involved in the community, and prove your interest
and general competence, there’s a **decent chance** you’ll be able to find
a role regardless of your qualifications and experience."

Do you have an example for making such a claim? What is "prove your
interest", what is "decent chance", What does "regardless" mean? I
don't know.

Naturally, the wording "regardless of qualifications and experience,
decent chance" foolishly made me (and others I guess) assume that
HEART (surrendering everything to the cause) is all that it took to
get into EA. That is surely not the case as I learnt later in EA
forum.

One example however was enough for me to come back to reality. That is
the POWER OF EXAMPLES. Guy named ["EA Applicant"](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really) makes a post on
EA forum. He applied to 20 jobs. He didn't get a single job, neither
did his friends who he claims had the "right" characteristics. It was
"that competitive" I realized after looking at examples and his CV and
what he had done. How only 4% of "strong-resume" people who applied,
got into Open Phil (Open Phil 2018 hiring round) or for that matter
Charity entrepreneurship (1%), or GiveWell or EAF baffles me while
80000hours used to chant "Talent constrained slogan". Basically it
seems to have meant different things to different people (\#ENGLISH
\#words). I was with 80000hours until I saw the posts on EA forum
about "reality" or more clearly, CONCRETE EXAMPLES.

I really wish to make a plea to you to PLEASE USE EXAMPLES and not
JUST ENGLISH to convey what you want to say. I know you can't provide
statistics for every claim but examples on how you think, why you make
claims the way you do, would be really helpful if people were looking
at your website to actually take action.

People might say "it makes sense", oh "I understand it", but what do
they even mean with "understanding" it when they don't have one
example of what those English words mean.

The keyideas post has so many tons of claims. I have the option of
accepting it blindly (thinking that I understand it), rejecting it or
verifying it with an example atleast and ending up spending way too
much time. Instead I find EA forum, talking to people in the community
much more useful. I have sadly refrained from looking at the OPINION
posts (for e.g., 80k) that are somehow beyond being questioned, unlike
in the EA FORUM where there is a **comments section** that is actually
active. You are neither reachable for comment nor did I get any info
when I tried once to clarify what something meant while reading your
blog post on Data Science.

By not providing more evidence you are basically claiming that you are
the authority on the subject. You are basically asking me and people
like me to take it or leave it. Even taking it is hard as mentioned
above, cause I have no idea what you are talking about.

### AI claims

**Claim**: "At every national security and technology conference that
80,000 Hours has attended, speakers have lamented the government’s
lack of expertise on AI, and noted the substantial demand for such
expertise within government. For example, DoD’s new Joint AI Center
alone is apparently looking to hire up to 200 people." ---[AI policy
80k](https://80000hours.org/articles/us-ai-policy/)

What exactly are the speakers lamenting about? What exactly are they
missing? What type of people are they missing? POLICY is a word that
encompasses tons of things I suppose. How many jobs do you expect in
the next year vs 10 years? (A transparent estimation perhaps).  Would
be helpful to get answers to the questions above so that people can
actually take action, skill up in that direction.

DOD's JAIC seems to have hired 10 people in total in POLICY over the
last two years according to Linkedin. 80000hours says 200 people were
needed by JAIC on the whole (for all job positions), which seems to
indicate a wrong order of magnitude about the number of AI policy
people hired by JAIC.

You keep saying there is a "huge" demand for AI policy people. Does
any body know what HUGE stands for? I don't. 

**Claims**: There are a lot of jobs currently(last 3 months) for AI
Policy in Govt. and Academia.

This is me verifying what "lot of jobs" actually could mean: So I saw
only about [10 jobs identified as per 80000hours job board](https://80000hours.org/job-board/ai-safety-policy/) between
Jan to March (3 month period) including all types of senior roles,
non-profits and interns too that had to do with Policy. I know you
can't cover all the jobs that are there in the world. But I guess you
covered the "important" ones. Are we talking about 40 jobs per year or
400 or 4000? The above example informs me that it is in the order of
40 per year.

Maybe you can list all the govt departments and how many are currently
working in each dept. And say extrapolate or something. Just
suggesting things you could do to make things concrete. Some
quantitative feel more than "speakers lamented in every govt about
lack of AI expertise", is highly appreciated.

### Vagueness in EA survey

So the survey is supposed to inform us of what we need more of. I am
not even going to get into the validity of the survey or the use of
questions like, "Do people think their organization is Talent
constrained". There has been some discussion on the EA forum and you
guys responded with another blog post, but let's leave that for now.

When I see "GRs" are needed according to the survey I assume GRs such
as in Open Phil or any of the other EA orgs, is what is needed. If
they say "operations people" are missing, then I think they need
people like Tanya from FHI to run EA orgs. I can look her up on
Linkedin and get an idea what sort of person we are talking about.

But when survey says "one-on-one skills and emotional intelligence"
(as in EA), it could mean many things: talking to politicians about
causes (policy people maybe), People who are good at convincing people
changing their career path (career counselors), it could also mean
fundraisers in the front line bringing the big bucks. I am sure we can
think of other things as well. So what is it that people in the survey
even meant? everything? Why not just say, "we need policy people with
good social skills instead" or something more concrete. At least this
way the community knows what you are "missing" "exactly" rather than
allowing it to interpretation. This way, people can act on it. If the
survey takers could be provided with one example, like "`Tanya for
FHI` --> operations people", it makes things concrete and people
exactly know what the survey is talking about. Examples seem really
useful here and everywhere.

Another example: "the ability to really figure out what matters most
and set the right priorities"

???

### Career Capital

I am not a big fan of these broad terminologies as they don't allow ME
to act on them. Another case in point: "Best ways to gain Career
Capital (CC) are: Work at a growing organisation that has a reputation
for high performance; Getting a graduate degree; Working in Tech
sector; Taking a data science job; Working in think tanks; Making
"good connections", Having runway etc... " **Literally everything
under the sun.** I would like actionable insights.

I am unable to act on it. I could in theory pursue everything. I don't
know how to compare which decision has **higher CC and lower CC.** The
definition says: "CC puts you in a better position to make a
difference in the future, including skills, connections, credentials
and runway." When I work in Data Science in a FAANG job do I have
higher CC compared to when I work in computer science degree? I don't
know. Let's take "skills" even, Option A gives me computer skills and
Option B gives me leadership skills. Now which one offers better
skills? how do I compare? which has higher CC. It's just
vague. Whereas if we talk about salary or some other concrete things
then things are verifiable again. So please show us the right metrics
to compare. Please help us.

I guess you will say something like, "one size doesn't fit all". But
then your "General advice" is not helping, it is open to
interpretation and guesses. Economists routinely measure the impact of
high-school dropout vs high-school diploma vs some years of college
but dropout vs undergrad degree vs grad degree, in different fields,
using the variable "median weekly earnings" or "lifetime earnings". So
when someone says, "you need a degree to get ahead in life", I can
imagine that they mean $470 weekly wage increase. Whereas when someone
says, "Computer Science PhD is good CC", I am lost beyond
words. Contrast that to saying "One way to gain CC is by looking at
earnings". Then I could look at median earnings for Data Science FAANG
job vs Phd in computer science in say top 20 university (based on my
capability) and get ahead in life.

## Replaceability

The way you have covered replaceability--back in 2017 atleast--was
really vague and not thorough at all. I believed you back then. Now I have
completely flipped a 180 thanks to EA forum. Last I remember seeing
replaceability articles from you was [here](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#but-wont-i-be-replaceable).

So your article just says "the other person you replace will go on to
do something high-impact". This is too vague. No cases are
specified. No assumptions specified. Again, I could either trust your
claim blindly or reject it or verify it. How about helping the reader
gain more trust on this BIG CLAIM? I don't accept blindly that
Benjamin Todd is the authority of replaceability.

Imagine you had dealt with it like [this](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EP8x3vHRQJP57TjFL/the-counterfactual-impact-of-agents-acting-in-concert) as was done in the EA
forum with TONS OF EXAMPLES. Halstead motivates how to understand
"counterfactual" impact and gives tons of examples and I am a happy
man who can actually use this in my CEA calculations. This is what we
need. Not opinion posts loosely throwing what people feel about
reality.

Here is another article on [SHAPELY](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHZJ9i7QBtAJZ6byW/shapley-values-better-than-counterfactuals ). Its ok to be open ended, it
is ok to say we are not sure. But acting like the authority on
something and delivering such poor output opinion level posts is not
appreciated.

### Advice from 80k

I found somewhere that you had asked to do our own lifetime
calculations of impact by asking orgs about how much money they would
be willing to give up instead of hiring us. I hate this advice because
many orgs I contacted couldn't bother to help me with this (Open Phil,
etc...). Why would 80000hours ask people to do this? when they have
the most power and can request orgs for estimates about their current
employees which would give an indication.

### Conclusion

Your claims have to be testable and narrow and you should provide
examples. The lack of it is explained above. Hiding behind opinions
and having lack of accountability or questionability from the people
you are "targeting" (me), sounds unreasonable.

Hope you use less vague terms like Talent constraint or Career Capital or
"most good" etc...


P.S  
I am really sorry I wanted to tone it down (but already spent 2
hrs writing this and it was getting close to the deadline).
